After I graduate I'd like to move to Europe, but I have yet to make up my mind where specifically I would like to go. While I know inside the United States the process to become an actuary is fairly straightforward (Have 2+ exams passed, and experience at an internship), I know next to nothing about what I need to do in order to become certified abroad. Could anyone shed some light on what I need to do in the next 4 years in order to move after I graduate?

**[Fair warning: massive wall of text / life story ahead!]**

Hey LoseIt,
First of all, I just wanted to thank all of the wonderful people in this community who have helped to make my transformation possible. The advice, support, and motivation I find here is indescribably amazing, which is why I return here day after day.

I wanted to offer some background on me and how I changed my life for the better, in the hopes that it may click with someone looking to make the same profound changes.

Ever since age six or so, I was always a bit on the heavier side. As a very young child, I had severe but correctable vision problems that had gone undiagnosed for the first few years of my life, which made it difficult for me to participate in sports, so from a young age, I fell into a trap of physical inactivity. Couple that with being raised in an Italian family where every gathering centers around high-carb foods in large quantities, and it’s no wonder I ended up the way I did.

The pounds just kept piling on throughout middle school and into high school, especially as I developed a marked fondness for sugar. One morning at age 17, I stepped on the scale and was absolutely mortified by what I saw. **220 pounds**. As a teenager who barely stood 5’6” at the time (accursed Italian genetics!), I did not carry this weight well. Understandably, I shied away from photographs -- I didn’t want there to be evidence of me looking the way I did. [However, there is one photo of me that exists when I was at or near that weight](http://i.imgur.com/p0TFv.jpg). I can’t be exactly sure how much I weigh in this photo, because I was so horrified by seeing 220 that I couldn’t bring myself to step on the scale for about 2½ years after that. I finished high school still overweight, and thought that college wouldn’t be much different.

Going off to college in San Francisco gave me no choice but to leave my car at home and get used to walking everywhere...uphill. That, coupled with the wide variety of surprisingly healthy cafeteria choices allowed me to lose about 22 pounds in my freshman year without any real conscious effort.

Although I managed to slim down somewhat, the typical pressures and pitfalls of college did eventually catch up to me -- burritos, root beer, alcohol, and late nights became all too common in my life. While I managed not to gain much more, I was still quite overweight. While I still had quite an active social life and made tons of friends, I can’t help but imagine how different things may have been had I actually been in shape during those four years.

I graduated from college with high honors back in May 2011 (I always put my studies before my health :P). Right after graduation, I continued working as an intern in the finance department for a large technology company -- long, sedentary hours which left me mentally exhausted at the end of the day. The mental fatigue was usually so bad that I would just end up eating something frozen or delivered for dinner because I was too burnt out by the end of the day to actually cook something decent for myself. That, and I would buy my lunch from the company cafeteria about 90% of the time. I had no idea how many dollars and calories I was wasting.

In an occurrence that would unknowingly change the course of my life forever, **that was the summer when I happened across r/LoseIt.** Seeing all of the wonderful advice being exchanged inspired me to make my first post. At the advice of some amazing Redditors, I began to keep a simple daily log of my weight and everything I was eating. I also started to cook a week's worth of food on the weekend and portion them out into individual meals for the week so that I would have no excuses to eat poorly at the end of the workday. My go-to meal was oven-roasted chicken breast with a heaping helping of mixed vegetables and a small side of quinoa. Lunches usually consisted of salads or homemade chicken/tuna wraps. Also, I ditched my morning bowl of cereal for eggs and vegetables -- kept me so much happier and more satisfied during the day. The difference I saw in my weight, mood, and energy levels even after just one month of eating better was phenomenal. But there was still the pesky matter of exercise -- I was still very much out of shape. I wouldn’t even need both of my hands to count the number of times I went to my campus gym during my four years there.

Now, exercise and I have a long and tumultuous history (middle school and high school PE, anyone?) I was wracking my brain over the options I had -- gym membership? Yoga? Spin? I didn't know what the hell I was going to do, but I knew I couldn’t keep sitting on my ass. I then received an e-mail that made it perfectly clear. Groupon -- $39 for 6 weeks of “fitness boot camp”.

The offer promised 30-minute, highly-rigorous cardio and resistance-based workouts at 7:00am three to four times per week. I signed myself up and eagerly awaited orientation. When orientation day came (on a Saturday, with class to start on the following Monday), I found myself nervously sitting in a fitness studio with a few dozen fellow Groupon'ers, absolutely befuddled and reconsidering this huge mistake I was about to make. I thought to myself, ""In my 4 years at college, I can count the number of times I went to the campus gym on one hand, and I'm about to start something called 'boot camp'?! What the hell am I thinking?"" I spent the rest of that weekend ruminating and trying to think of valid excuses not to go. 

I couldn't come up with one. Fast forward to Monday, August 1st, 2011. Alarm clock goes off at 5:30am -- thankfully, I'm very much a morning person. I fix myself two eggs and a 1/2 cup of rice, and pack a gym bag for the first time. [My ""before"" picture above was taken in the morning right before my first boot camp session.]
I get to the facility early as instructed, only to see the pained faces of the brave souls from the 6:15am class as they finished their last set of lord-knows-what. I was literally shaking in my gym shorts. After they finished their warm-down stretches, it was my turn to hit the floor. After a bit of group stretching, it was finally time to begin circuit #1. I'd be damned if I even remember what we did in our very first circuit, because 30 minutes later, I found myself in the bathroom, on the verge of throwing up. It was then that I realized just how out of shape I was and how I was not OK with it.

I managed to get myself over to work and into the showers in my office building. I got dressed and headed up to my desk, and fought tooth-and-nail to stay awake for the rest of the morning. I returned home from work that day absolutely exhausted and wondering if I was gonna make it to another session. I spent all of the next day intermittently popping ibuprofen and trying not to move too much. As much as I was hurting, I was determined to make it on Wednesday morning.

And make it I did. And it sucked. And on Friday. That sucked too. And all three days the next week. And every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for 4 weeks afterwards. But each time, the workouts became ever so slightly easier, and I found myself getting less and less winded after each one. Soon, I found that I was feeling more energetic during the day -- no more 2:30 crash at work! But the good changes didn't stop there. My clothes began to feel more like blankets. I went through each item in my closet individually, and had to say goodbye to so many clothes that had served me well in the past.

Although I loved the boot camp immensely, it was too expensive to continue at a non-discount price, but the confidence, knowledge, and motivation I gained in those six weeks have carried on with me ever since. I made the resolution to be more active in general, and to capitalize on my alumni membership discount for my old campus gym.

While I had slimmed down considerably during 2011, I neglected the importance of strength training, [and ended up in the awkward ""skinny-fat"" category](http://i.imgur.com/DWvwA.jpg). That's when I decided that it was time for me to hit the weight room. At the recommendation of a friend (who happens to be a personal trainer), I picked up the book [The New Rules of Lifting](http://www.thenewrulesoflifting.com), and I can honestly say that it's probably the best $15 I've ever spent on a piece of printed material. Armed with the knowledge and confidence to hit the weight room for the first time, I started the beginner’s program at the beginner of 2012. The energy, confidence, and muscle I've built from a seven months of lifting weights has been nothing short of incredible, and I can't stress the importance of strength training enough when it comes to weight loss and overall fitness.

The renewed sense of invigoration I got from losing the weight and becoming healthy gave me the courage to do something else that I never thought possible -- ride a bike.  A couple of bad experiences as an overweight, uncoordinated, unathletic child basically put me off bike riding for good. I was always embarrassed by the fact that I was in my twenties and still didn’t know how to ride a bike. I then turned to my uncle (who is quite knowledgeable about bikes), and he was kind enough to provide me a very basic hybrid that I could use to get my bearings. I told my older brother that I wanted to go riding with him, and he took me out to an empty parking lot near his house to practice. I couldn’t believe that I was actually riding within a matter of minutes -- **all I had to do was try**. I couldn't believe that I allowed my own lack of confidence to hold me back for so long. Later on in our ride, I fell and took a bit of a tumble, [but I’m incredibly happy that I did](http://i.imgur.com/aRwqo.jpg).

Ever since then, I have become absolutely smitten with biking. In June, I decided to [treat myself to a brand new bike and ride the hell out of that thing](http://i.imgur.com/L6NJG.jpg). Discovering amazing parts of San Francisco by bike brings me unimaginable happiness. I now put 30-40 miles on my bike per week :D

Now that I have lost all the weight I wanted to lose for medical and health reasons, I am now focused on improving my general fitness and physical appearance (as vain as that may be :P). I have shifted my diet to a slight caloric surplus with high protein in order to gain strength and about 10 pounds of lean mass over the next several months.

In celebration of my one year milestone, I decided to head over to California Pacific Medical Center this morning and treat myself to a body composition analysis using the [BodPod](http://www.cosmed.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1262&amp;Itemid=310&amp;lang=en), a sophisticated device with a much greater degree of accuracy and narrower margin of error than other methods of measurement (bioelectrical impedance, skin caliper testing, etc.).  The body fat readings on my scale at home (which I have used as a rough guide and for mostly just trending purposes) usually gave readings around 15%, but I wanted to get a proper analysis done just so see how comparable the two might be. After the technician took my measurements, I was absolutely flabbergasted to see how drastically different they were.

[My current stats](http://i.imgur.com/Elfnq.jpg):
Height = 5 feet 6½ inches
Weight = 144.3 pounds
Waist = 30½ inches
Body Fat % = 9.2%

Even accounting for the +/- 2% margin of error of the BodPod, I am still probably in the realm of 10-11% body fat, something I never imagined possible. Having been heavier for so long, my brain’s mental image of itself is having a rather difficult time catching up to what I see in the mirror, but having some hard scientific data definitely helped to put things into perspective for me and reassure me of the progress I’ve made over the last year :)

Also, if this process has taught me anything, it’s that one should never be without goals. I am thrilled to have participated in my first mini-triathlon back in April, something I never thought possible one year ago. Even though I finished at the back of the pack (I’m a horrendous runner and swimmer), just finishing was the real victory for me. Going forward, I have a number fitness goals that I aim to accomplish in the next year, including:

- Participate in a proper 5K race (bonus: complete it within 30 minutes)
- Participate in the sprint-distance Golden Gate Triathlon (bonus: complete it within 2 hours)
- Put 1,500 miles on the odometer of my bike by July 2013 (bonus: 2,000 miles!)
- Complete a half-century [50-mile] bike ride (bonus: complete it within 3½ hours)
- Participate in the NorCal Warrior Dash this October (bonus: complete it within 45 minutes)
- Participate in the NorCal Spartan Race in April 2013 (bonus: survive)

For anyone who is looking to lose weight or get healthy, just remember this: **there is no magic pill, shake, or gizmo that will take the place of clean eating, hard work, and personal diligence.** It is remarkable to me how quickly the weight came off once I took control over what I was eating. At no point in this journey did I feel starving or deprived -- when you're full on tasty, nutritious, wholesome foods, your body no longer craves the processed junk anymore. Losing the weight and getting fit has simultaneously been the easiest and most difficult thing I've ever done; the diet and exercise is easy, but casting aside all of the self-doubt and excuses was definitely the challenging part. Also, don’t fall into the trap of “I’ll start tomorrow/next week/next month/after vacation/whatever” -- right now is the best time to take that first step towards dramatically improving your life.

The three things I've found to be necessary for successful weight loss are *education*, *motivation*, and *perspiration.*

- **Education**: Learn everything you can about your body's needs and how to properly fuel it. The LoseIt FAQ in the sidebar on the right is a great place to start. The resources therein will help you determine just how much energy your body actually needs and how to properly fuel it in line with those needs. Learn about nutrition, and how the right kinds of foods will keep you satiated and running at the most efficient level possible. Learn the differences between fat, protein, and carbohydrates, and why each one is important.

- **Motivation**: Your desire to change has to outweigh the comfort and ease of leaving things the way they are and accepting the status quo. For most people, weight loss isn't easy nor is it fun. For some, it's a constant struggle that requires a significant amount of daily effort. You're not going to find success unless you decide that you truly want to change.

- **Perspiration**: Once you know what to do, how to do it, and why you're doing it, the final step is going out there and actually doing it. As simple as it sounds, this is often the hardest part for so many people. I would argue that almost everyone knows the basic weight-loss formula of ""eat less, move more"" (*education*) and know of all of the great health benefits they would reap by becoming physically fit (*motivation*), but they just don't do anything. My journey has involved considerable effort. I wake up between 5:30 and 6:00 in the morning in order to have enough time to bike/lift, cook myself a proper breakfast, and do all of the things I need to get done before getting to work. I've definitely been put in awkward social situations when I politely decline certain foods that everyone else is consuming because they're not compatible with my goals. It's definitely work, but at this point, it’s a labor of love.

In one short but amazing year, I have experienced a significant transformation, both physically and emotionally. Although I lost fifty pounds of body weight, what’s far more important are the things I gained during the process: a deeper knowledge and appreciation of the human body and its workings, a renewed sense of passion and gusto for life that simply wasn’t there this time last year, and an unrelenting desire to help others discover the same joys of healthy and active living. On that note, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me for any support you may need in your own journey -- I wish for nothing more than to see others succeed in their weight loss and fitness endeavors!

In the past, one year seemed like quite a long time to me, but I now realize that it represents only a small fraction of my life lived thus far (and an even smaller fraction of the healthy, vibrant life I have yet to live!)

I didn’t know that this would end up being such a long post -- I just felt that there was so much I wanted to share in the hopes that my story may strike a chord or inspire someone out there to make the same positive change for themselves.  

This whole journey would have been considerably more difficult had it not been for the incredible outpouring of encouragement and support I’ve received from friends, family, and of course, the LoseIt community. For that, I sincerely thank you all. Please continue to share your victories and struggles, no matter how great or small -- it’s what makes this community so great.

In health and happiness,

Dave"

Now I need y'alls opinions. 

I am an intern for a startup company here in Austin, and we want some feedback on our idea. I work at songseeds.org where we help local artists get studio time and allow the listeners/fans to directly be in charge of the music. So you can buy a ""songseed"" (a song that is not fully finished yet) and those proceeds will go towards helping the artist to pay for studio time. When the song is completed, if you bought the songseed it will be bundled and given to you for free so you can see what you have helped create. Right now we're doing a 10 bands/40 days campaign where we have 10 local artists lined up to record 3 songs a piece in the 40 days. We're also looking to do an event with all of these artists sometime in September. Can you help me with giving any feedback about this idea/the website/anything? If you want to check out what we're doing here is our [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Songseedsorg/124478697641357) page to see what we have been up to recently. THANKS GUYS!"

Honostly I really don't feel any better than I did than when I was smoking except for the fact I don't have to worry about doing something illegal. In that time I have obtained a decent summer internship at a respectable company. I only have a week left to my employment here and I am really unmotivated to get anything done anymore. I am really unmotivated to do anything. I sleep a lot and am not really interested in doing anything. I have been flying under the radar at work not really doing anything. I just don't see a point anymore. 

According to my psychiatrist I am bipolar. The problem is that I don't really trust or respect him. He doesn't seem to care about me and I only see him for 5 minutes every three months. Is this normal? How can he make such a huge decision based off of so little evidence. I have tried for sometime to remeber my medication but when I take it I just sleep all day and feel no different. I have gotten to the point where I haven't taken it for a few months and don't know what to tell him. 

I have been an off and on smoker for 5 years. Looking back at my school performance I got better grades when I was smoking than when I wasn't. I only have one more semester in school and the start date is coming up quick. My crossroad is do I pick up when I come back? I have sufficient income, a school job, my sober friends say I am nicer when I smoke. 

If you read all this thank you. I feel like I am just ranting about my life but I am really finding it hard to justifying not smoking."
xi4cx,3,2012-08-01,I'm moving from Oklahoma to Maryland next year. Any suggestions on where to live?,jackieisme,maryland,https://www.reddit.com/r/maryland/comments/xi4cx/im_moving_from_oklahoma_to_maryland_next_year_any/,"Hi /r/Maryland! I just accepted a job offer for next year in Maryland, specifically in the south Columbia/North Laurel area. I've been trying to get a feel for the neighborhoods around here while I'm still here for my internship, but that's ending soon. All I've found so far from being here over the summer, as well as /r/Maryland, is that PG county is sketchy and Howard county is nice but expensive. Does anyone have any suggestions on where to live? I'll try to give an idea of what I'm looking for.

* Safe, quiet suburban neighborhood. Even though I'm only 21, I'm actually pretty okay with living around ""old people"". I hear a lot of people complain about Columbia because it's full of families and old people, which they find boring, but that's currently my top choice. It's just the cost that's worrying me. I'm currently living in College Park and, it may be that I'm in the wrong neighborhood, but I really don't like it - I don't feel very safe.

* I would prefer a commute no longer than 30-40 minutes. I hear that if I can manage to find a place south of work, then I'd be good. But, I also hear that many places south of my work (Laurel and College Park) are kind of sketchy.

* I'm hoping to have a roommate (if anyone's looking for one!), so I'm aiming for a 2BR/2BA apartment or townhouse. I'm looking for anything between $1200 and $1700 if I have a roommate. But, if I do have to live by myself, I would want to look at a lower price range, maybe $1100 to $1400. I really like the idea of a townhome, but at the same time I understand that that could get pricey...

* I've grown up in a pretty new and spacious home, so I'm a little hesitant on living in older homes (build date &lt;1985). Are there any newer, affordable apartments or townhouses around the area?

* I don't really care if I live too close to the metro. I figured that I could just drive to closest station should I ever need to. But I have no desire to live within walking distance (to stave off the high cost of living). Similarly, I don't care to live near a big city (DC or Baltimore). I figured I would just metro or drive in if I want to visit.

Thanks in advance for any help!


**EDIT:**
Thanks for all off the help! I'm currently comparing two apartment complexes. One is in Odenton and the other is in  Howard county (the Emerson community). Could anyone help me compare these two? Emerson is a bit more expensive and newer, but closer to shopping areas. Odenton is cheaper but still new. But there's not too much around. I really like both, so I'm not sure what to think. Emerson is also closer to work, but it seemed slightly sketchier. But I'm not real sure - I haven't been around there much. Could anyone help? Thanks again! "
xhjgj,0,2012-07-31,Looking for an undergrad roommate,[deleted],UBC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/xhjgj/looking_for_an_undergrad_roommate/,"Hey there!

I have a basement suite available for the school year and I'm looking for a roommate(s) (females only please!). PM me if you're interested or know someone that would be. 

Here is the description of the place:

Large 1000 sq. ft. 3 bedroom, bright basement suite in  executive home.   High 8 foot ceiling.  Cable TV,  cable internet access included.  Kitchen and bathroom in the process of being newly renovated. Kitchen includes appliances - 20 cu ft fridge, stove, dishwasher and microwave.   There is a long and wide entrance hall so bikes can be either left outside at entrance or brought in.  Also included  are 2  couches, TV and stand, diningroom table, chairs, bookcases, buffet, desks, pots, pans, kitchen utensils  and lots more. Rooms are fully furnished with desk and bed.  Quiet neighbourhood, lots of parking and storage. Laundry facility included.    1 block from bus stop and 5 minutes to UBC loop.  We are situated next to the forest with numerous trails for jogging and biking.  Shopping close by at 41st and Dunbar.   Responsible, non-smoking  students only.  3 persons maximum.   References required. $1950 plus utilities.

Like the ad says, the place will be undergoing kitchen and bathroom renovations. You could potentially move in while the renovations are going on for a reduced rate until the renovations are complete come mid-September. I have pictures but the place will look way different at the end of the renos so it's not worth posting them up at the moment. 

About myself: I'm transferring to UBC after taking a year off from school to do an internship in PR. I'm 21, female, and originally from Montreal. I'm totally respectful and really easy to get along with. I do enjoy having a social life and wouldn't want to live with people who don't have the same philosophy.  

There are 3 bedrooms so if you are two people looking for a place then we can work something out (rent would be 650 per person + utilities but the rooms would be smaller.) There's also the possibility of only having one roommate and the third bedroom will be used as an 'office' for that person (700 per person plus utilities). 

I'm hoping to not have to resort to craigslist and use this as word of mouth. 

Merci :)

1. I struggle in math. I'm taking AP-level or AP-equivalent math classes but I can usually only manage Bs. I hear the Duke math program is tough. Will I be okay?

2. I'm almost definitely going to major in Computer Science. I've been programming for a while now and I love it. I'm using a throwaway, so I'm being completely honest when I say I've actually been very successful for my age. Some of my projects have received decent media coverage. People at my internship tell me I'm at a sophomore to junior level college CS major right now as well. It seems CS isn't too popular at Duke. The program seems alright from rankings, but I was hoping maybe I could get a good student opinion on this.

3. I'm quite introverted. I'm not a social disaster but I'm generally sort of awkward and very shy. I hear Duke is a very social campus and I feel I might get labeled as a ""freak"", for lack of a better word. I will try to use college as a learning experience in this area but if anyone could touch on this a little bit I would really appreciate it.

4. So when I toured, obviously I fell in love with the campus and the architecture. I also noticed that in what you guys might call the quad or something, it looks like there are dorms in those buildings surrounding it. Sort of like [this area](http://img.groundspeak.com/waymarking/9b00d3e9-8486-4f20-812a-5eda6c6da494.jpg). Are those seriously dorms where you can walk out and be right in the quad? Who do I have to fight/pay to get a room there? And yes, I know, not freshman year.

I would really appreciate it if any of you guys could take a few minutes to help me out here. Thanks!"

I'm coming to Chicago in September for an internship that will last through December.  My internship supervisor has been giving me tips on finding a rental.  I found a place in the Ukrainian Village for $1300 a month.  It's small, 600 square feet, but that includes all utilities (wi-fi too), plus it's completely furnished, including linens and kitchen things.  My supervisor says that the landlord is charging way too much.  I have no clue.  It seems to be a better deal than a lot of other sublets and short term rentals I'm seeing.  It's also in a much nicer building (1 of 3 flats in a Victorian building).  The price is definitely way above what I would pay if I were looking for a regular lease, I understand that, but I need short term and furnished.  Can anyone else provide some insight?  I've checked out craigslist and some other resources for sublets, and I'm getting pretty frustrated.  Everything is either really expensive (over $2000), really crappy, or clearly a scam.  Any help/perspective would be much appreciated.   "

Last year I got into an internship abroad program where it gives you access to employers across the globe looking for interns. I haven't had much luck applying for internships so far and my membership runs out in 5 more months. 

In June, my sister was diagnosed with stomach cancer and it took a toll on my entire family, but we're getting by now. My sister's prognosis was 11 months but the doctors are optimistic and are aiming for 3 years. I love my sister to death and it was hard on me too when I found out how much time she had left. I want to spend as much time with her as possible but at the same time I would really like to go abroad for the experience. I'm very conflicted right now and don't know if I should continue to apply for internships or withdraw from the program. If I were to get an internship abroad I would be aiming for a 4-6 month placement. Would It be selfish of me to leave her and my family?"

Today was not a day which encouraged any of this.

We were almost out of food in the fridge this morning. I almost caved and went to burger king for breakfast, but instead I took 15 minutes to make the most perfect hardboiled eggs I've ever made. I put some tomato on it, ate it, and went to work.

Then my coworkers were going to Starbucks. I regretted asking to come along about five seconds after asking. I went anyway, and found a drink that was primal-friendly: Unsweetened passion tazo tea. 0 calories, 0 carbs, nothing artificial as far as I can tell.

Finally, today at work we are having an intern barbecue. I have my own meat and toppings, some fruit I can have for snacks, and a determination not to give into temptation.

I'm actually looking forward to super-strict august, and hopefully will find many days where I follow my plan to the letter and don't feel guilty."
xkgo0,7,2012-08-02,"Ex wants to meet to discuss ""us.""  I'm finally over her and really happy.  She has some depression issues.  How do I handle this delicately?",changeovertime,AskWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/xkgo0/ex_wants_to_meet_to_discuss_us_im_finally_over/,"Short sentences.  Trying to save space.  Throwaway account.

Best friends in high school.  Started dating in college (separate colleges). Dated for 2 full years; happy, loving, caring, fun relationship.  We have been broken up for about a year and a half now.

Around the time of the breakup, we both got really busy and had some communication issues (colleges were 3 hours apart, so we couldn't always visit).  I was preparing for graduation and working an internship while she had a full class load. I realized we were both not making enough time for each other and tried to fix this; skyping more often, finding more weekends to go visit each other, and so on.  But despite my efforts, she got more and more distant.

Turns out, she met a guy (her new ""best friend"") at school and they had been hanging out a lot.  I eventually talk to her about it after noticing some very flirty Facebook wall posts between them.  She assures me everything is fine; he's just a friend (I know these types of guys; he's *not* wanting friendship at all).  

Eventually gives me a speech about how she doesn't want to feel tied down in a relationship anymore and wants to enjoy her college experience.  Apparently that translated to ""jump into another long-term relationship with this guy a week after we break up.""

I was shocked and hurt.  Was depressed, got over it, got better.  Was happy for a bit.  Over the summer, she calls me out of the blue and wants to meet up.  We talk and she spills her heart about how this guy was a mistake.  He was emotionally abusive and she wants to break up with him and wants us back together.  Being the fucking idiot I was, I tell her okay.  

We get kind of close again, but she soon leaves for college (her last year; I had graduated so I stayed home to work my new job) and things stay unresolved.  I try and call her every now and again; she either ignores me or says she doesn't have time to talk.  I take it as a sign.

This time I move on for good!  Its been almost a year since then and I'm feeling great!  I'm loving single life, dating casually, spending a lot of time with my friends, being more social than ever, am in amazing shape, and am working a job I love!  I'm also more confident and no longer a doormat.

Now that she's moved back from college for good, she wants to talk about ""us"" again.

I still see her as my best friend and will always care about her deeply, but I have to say, I just don't love her like I did before.  When we were together I would have done anything for her, but after her leaving me the way she did out of the blue, her image was pretty tarnished.

That being said, I obviously still care about her well being and feelings, as a friend.  She has recently developed some heavy depression issues (she's seeing a professional about it and is on meds).  According to her, ever since our break up, she's been in a downward spiral.  Drugs, depression, alcohol, shitty boyfriends, suicidal thoughts, etc.

So how do I handle this delicately.  How do I stand my ground and tell her I *don't* want her back and that I'm finally happy, without hurting her in her fragile state?  I do still care about her; we have so much history as best friends and as partners. I just don't love her the same way.

Sorry for the short, jumbled sentences; I'm trying to get the point across while avoiding a wall of text.  Thank you for your female perspective on this.

**TL;DR:** Best friends.  Date for 2 years.  Breaks my heart, dates another guy.  I almost get back together with her after she begs me to because I used to be a doormat.  We spend another year apart.  I'm a new person and am over her; happy, confident, single and loving life.  I don't love her anymore but still care about her.  She wants to talk about getting back together now that she's graduated.  She has depression issues so I want to handle this delicately."

My story isn't really a typical ""need motivation"" story, but I hope that one of you guys can give me the wake-up call I need.
I'm currently working as an intern for the summer. Whereas the other interns at my company have been working with a variety of different people throughout the summer, I have been working predominantly with the same girl the whole summer. She is only a few years older than me, and we both went to the same school (she graduated a few years ago, I will be graduating in a few years). The problem is that I have completely fallen for this girl. She is extremely attractive, smart, and has a great personality.
As we have been working together the whole summer, I see her and talk to her constantly every day. As the summer has passed, we have become somewhat closer, and I have become more and more obsessed  with her. However, I know that she 100% does not feel the same way about me, and there is no way that any sort of relationship between us will ever happen.
Working with her has made me very happy, but whenever I'm not with her, its hard not to think of her. I become miserable when I go a day without seeing her. Next week she will be out of town all week, and I will have 0 communications with her. I have no idea how I will survive.
I basically need a slap in the face, and for someone to tell me that I don't need her to be happy. There are plenty of other girls out there who can make me just as happy. Also, as my job finishes at the end of the month, I need to face the fact that I will most likely not see her anymore after the summer.
To make things worse, I have never had a girlfriend as I have lacked the self-confidence to ask a girl out. However, I feel that I have recently gained some self-confidence, and would ask someone out when the time was right. 
Now you know that I am a pathetic bastard. I just need someone to wake my sorry ass up and tell me to get on with my life without worrying about this girl. I just need to let go of her, but that is not/will not be easy..."

I'm currently a 21 yr old, soon-to-be college junior.  I'm currently in the midst of applying to schools as a transfer from a mediocre SUNY, and was recently accepted to Georgetown, Cornell, Boston College, NYU, Holy Cross, Fordham, and a few other safeties.  I guess I shot myself in the foot by not looking past my initial radar of ""reach schools"" as I got into every school I applied to.  My stats consist of:

2.8 HS GPA
27 ACT
3.9 GPA in Community College
EC's such as: Investment Bank Internship, PWM Internship @ UBS, Econ/Math Tutor @ School, VP of Econ Club, Habitat for Humanity, Phi Theta Kappa, Phi Mega Omnicron, Speech Honors Society, and another internship in the city at a FOREX fund.  

Now, I am happy with the schools I got into, but UPenn (CAS) is lightyears ahead of them.  Seeing as how if I took another semester off, I'd only be graduating 2 years late and could get some work experience in while I waited, I wouldn't mind it TOO much, as long as I had a decent shot at acceptance.  That said, if I took another year off and ended up being rejected, I'd probably feel pretty badly graduating at 24 when I didn't need to.  

What's your advice?  Do you think I'd have a shot with these stats?  My problem is that I feel like I made a mistake when choosing schools and thought my ""reaches"" may have actually been matches, and didn't both to throw in apps to any other schools.  UPenn would be sick to get into, I just need to know if I have a shot before I make this decision, or if I'm being delusional and my HS/Test scores would invalidate me immediately.  Thanks a ton!"

xn3f9,0,2012-08-03,Ask BSA:  What has getting your Eagle done for you that you never expected as a teen?,JohnyQ,BSA,https://www.reddit.com/r/BSA/comments/xn3f9/ask_bsa_what_has_getting_your_eagle_done_for_you/,"I always love sharing my story of opportunities that I've had since completing my Eagle, the doors that it has opened and the people that I've encountered as a result.

First thing, College.  The eagle helped me acquire a full ride NROTC scholarship to a major university where I studied engineering for four years and graduated with a BS in Aerospace Engineering.  

Second, the eagle helped me get an internship during college with the Colorado Secretary of State's office.  I was given some challenging projects while I was there and ended up with some great experiences and was able to help a brand new program that the state was offering take off - wrote procedures, managed the fledgling program, and documented everything!

Finally, and by far the biggest, my eagle is the direct reason that I have the employment that I have now.  After graduating from college I returned home to pursue the passion of flying and was taking training for my Private Pilot's License.  One evening my dad was at a father/daughter dance with my sister at a local country club.  

As parents are oft to do, my dad and another fellow met each other and began talking about their kids.  First were the daughters that were at the event, but then they started discussing their other kids and eventually I came up in the discussion.  My dad started talking about my recent graduation and my return home.  The gentleman was listening intently.  He started asking some more questions about me and my studies, interested in my engineering background and was indicating to my dad that I should speak with him and apply for a position at the company where he worked.  My dad said that we would be in contact, but that I had plans to attend the 2010 Jamboree that was coming up in a month.  This struck the gentleman and he asked if I was an Eagle Scout.  My father replied that I was indeed.  Briefly shocked the gentleman said on the spot that he would hire me.  

I had to go through the formal process of course, but I wound up with a fantastic engineering position working on some great hardware.  After I got the job, I was speaking with the fellow who interviewed me and asked why I was picked to interview.  

He said that his son was in scouts and had become an Eagle, that he only looked for one criteria on a resumé - Eagle Scout.  The stack of hundreds of resumés was reduced to 3.  From those three I was picked and its all thanks to my Eagle.

What are your stories?

xmck9,27,2012-08-03,What I learned from /r/premed in 6 months,[deleted],premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/xmck9/what_i_learned_from_rpremed_in_6_months/,"Make sure you know what 4 year university you would like to go to. Many states have programs in order for people who graduate from community colleges in state with their AS (Associate of Science) to easily transfer in to a university in that state. If you plan to get two years under your belt then transfer to a 4 year, make sure you work closely with an advisor. They'll help you choose courses that will transfer. 

If you are top of your class and have a really great work ethic, while putting in a lot of work outside of academics (internships, volunteering, and leadership roles in student organizations) then you are really not going to have a problem with that debt. You're going to be scooped up by somebody; it's the 'average' student that really gets the shaft in these economic times.

Things students told that are not true and are **not** an edge: Clubs, Honor society membership. **GPA and MCAT are the most important things**.


Things that can make a difference and give you an edge: 

**University Science courses** (CC even with A's does not give advantage and some schools unofficially will not accept students with all CC science premed) (the Ivy League school factor only if your GPA is above average for applying) 


**Volunteering/Shadowing** (I do not believe that you can be accepted without doing this) I'd suggest getting some volunteer experience. Volunteerism, especially in medicine, looks very good and is necessary in some places. Most hospitals have volunteer departments and can set you up with something. Also, it's more important to be consistent than the actual time spent. You'll want to say you volunteered for an entire year somewhere, even if it's just two or three hours a week, rather than spending whole days for only a few weeks. The important thing is to cover all sorts of different areas of healthcare to demonstrate that you had experienced as much of the field as possible. Whatever you can get inside a hospital or office to observe and interact with doctors which would be beneficial and probably would be the best course of action. Some shadowing of all types of medical professionals will help. You need clinical volunteering, you need leadership roles. Social anxiety is not an excuse in the eyes of admissions committees so you best be sure you can handle the stress. Start this as early as possible in your undergrad since, during your last year, you will have less free time. 


**High GPA and High MCAT preferably** You need to do the MCAT which (for normal people) requires 2-3 months of studying and a financial and time investment in MCAT books. You also need to score over 30, unless your GPA is high enough to compensate for a lower score. To score over 30 means to be in the 85th or higher percentile of test takers. Take the MCAT when the time is right. Summer is the best time to study for the MCAT as it is difficult to handle schoolwork while consistently studying at the same time. Ideally, you take the MCAT during the summer after sophomore year, or, if you are taking a gap year, summer after junior year works as well. Start getting your application ready. One of the biggest mistakes you can make is submit a subpar application early vs. a well polished one later. Take the time the time to let your PS develop and evolve into something that will stand out among the 10,000+ applications that a school will receive. Strong writing takes time and shouldn't be rushed - the benefit of turning it in early is quite marginal.

**Research/Lab experience** - volunteer in one of your university's labs.

**Letter of Recommendations**: Build relationships with your professors. Read their research, and find excuses to talk to them. Talk in class as often as possible, and if you see them around campus, chat them up. Then if you don't have legitimate reasons to see them during office hours, study harder until you get to some level at which you need them to explain things. 

Things you should know: Any major is fine. No time frame, if it takes you 5 or 6 years to get to applying fine. MCAT is offered all year no set time, no set year in college to take it, take it when ready. Any University is fine (Not CC or plain College but Uni)

To try to map out how to accomplish such a task, I thought of all the major things premeds had to accomplish to just apply, let alone be accepted to medical schools.

* Premed prerequisites
* Graduation requirements
* Extracurriculars (research, volunteering, clinical experience)
* MCAT studying and test-taking
* Letters of recommendation
* Application compiling, editing, and waiting

Regardless of what you major in, you need to do the following: Earn a strong general GPA. Do well in all your pre-med required courses. Do well on the MCAT. Get good, meaningful recommendations. These don't have to be from scientists, but they do need to be from academics or professionals who know you well. The best recommendation comes from a professor with whom you have worked closely for more than just a summer. Your work with the professor has to be consistent and of high quality in whichever field you are working.

If you don't have time for the long story, the above quote can simply give you what you need. The short of it is that the girl is my ex because she believed that I needed to sacrifice things to be with her, which no one should ever have to do. I'm in my office on a Friday with nothing to do, so I have no problem making this super long, but you want good advice right? Here's the long of it:

More than a year ago now, I started a relationship with this large breasted chick that was studying Kinesiology in her senior year of college. ""Beautiful and smart!"" were my initial opinions of her. I eventually was compelled to ask her out, and I did, and we went out. Somehow along the way I started a relationship from there. 

Things were happy and life was good. We were in the early stages of the relationship, where you find out all the little things about each other. I never really saw too many negatives on her, based on what she did. She pulled nice grades, was getting nice internships and shit. Played soccer and all that crap. 

So it appeared to me that she had it all, which as a guy, I will admit for a stupid reason, is somewhat pressuring, because here I am, a guy in his early 20's that just goes to school part time, works IT during the day, and smokes weed and plays video games by night. A common thought in the back of my head was that I hoped she didn't think I was any less than her.

I'm 22 years old, and live in Boston. I have my own apartment in the city and work in a nice IT job. I also play a shit ton of video games and smoke a lot of weed, (total shocker I bet) but having said that, I have a firm grasp on what my priorities are, and always make sure I can do what I can to see that my significant other is happy, which is what anyone should always try to do. I'm a decent, average guy is what I'm saying.

Let me throw out there, that it wasn't until 9 months in that she told me that she actually hates weed and video games, but I digress...

About a few months into the relationship she tells me we need to have a serious talk. She tells me that she doesn't like it when I'm high, because I don't take everything seriously, (which I can admit, she wasn't too far off there) and that I invest way to much of my time into video games that amount to nothing in real life. She said that I should do other things with my time. Perhaps cut down gaming to only on the weekends, and completely abstaining from smoking weed. Being the nice guy that I am, I do so, because I believed she was making me a better person.

I held strong for a while, finding other things to do, and things were going great again. I had recently discovered reddit at this point and one of my friends introduced me to r/atheism, which as a former catholic, was compelling and very interesting to me. 

When I brought up all this to her, telling her all the facts I read up on, asking her what she thought, she first said ""Is this really what you're thinking of doing? Because anyone that I'm with, that doesn't have faith, I can't be with.""

Now I finally stopped giving the benefit of the doubt at this point, because I truly felt bad about this situation I walked into. Here I was simply bringing up new thoughts and facts, (mind you, she is a Greek Orthodox) and she's now putting the relationship on an ultimatum. It made me think, what would happen in a world where I was with this girl for a while, we started some family, and then I tell her I am an atheist now, would she really drop everything and leave? Seemed ridiculous to me. Even more ridiculous when she said she'd actually do that.

At that point I realized I wasn't actually enjoying myself anymore. Here I was, with someone that clearly didn't like my hobbies, and didn't have the same open-mindedness as me. I had done everything I could to be a good boyfriend to her, and the person she wanted me to turn into for her, wasn't me being myself. And that is a serious issue.

I had bought into the ""sacrifice"" bullshit before, hoping I'd turn into someone that would be in a happy relationship, but I was dodging the truth that in order for someone to be happy in the relationship, they must be themselves, and be with someone who WOULDN'T change a thing. Where you can truly just exist with someone, and not care. 

This may or may not be the worst relationship article ever, and if you don't walk away with much, just understand that whoever you are, is you, and that's beautiful. Embrace it and find someone else that can do the same, and you will have a great shot of being happy in life. Don't force similarities, and always remember that Love isn't all roses.

UPDATE: I have plenty more stories and experience to share and dwell on, so if this goes well, I plan on doing another one of these every Friday.

I'm just a guy that wants people to know that no one has to be perfect to be happy.


UPDATE: It turns out I made the right decision. I recently started dating a girl that I've known for a while, and we really feel compatible. It's great. 

Funny thing was was once we made it official on facebook, because that somehow matters, I got a text from my ex:

""have fun with your rebound."" 

I was pretty wierded out considering I blocked her from looking at my facebook. I was also pretty dissappointed that she was stilll that attached to me. I mean, I broke up with her in May, which is several months ago from now. 

I am going to elaborate deeper on this situation in another article, becuase it's definitely one to speak of, but the main thing I took away from her outburst, is that she is just craving attention to stay relevant.  She can't stand the fact that I'm happy and better off without her, so she's getting me upset to keep herself relevant.

If you are ever being bothered by a harassing ex, just simply ignore them, no matter how pissed off they make you from the shit they say. Remember, the whole reason they are saying the things they are, is to get a rise out of you, and your only playing into their hand when you show face. Be the classier, more mature human being, and come to terms with the bullshit for what it is: bullshit, and no one wants to waste their time on bullshit."
xmaox,19,2012-08-03,"We all know what happens when a guy waits too long to state his intentions.  But, can he state them too early?",yoshi_ghost,AskWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/xmaox/we_all_know_what_happens_when_a_guy_waits_too/,"Howdy.

Basically, I met a girl on her last day of work here and talked to her for about ten minutes.  We connected fine, had a laugh, it was nice.  She's gone now (I mean, she was right on her way out the door to downtown when we talked) and today was her last day as a summer intern.

She has kind of an usual name, so it should be easy to find her on FB and send a fun message.  But I'd like to see her again, one-on-one, if not on a date, then a ""pre-date"" hangout...I don't even know what that means, I just know that I have plenty of friends so I'm not really after her friendship, I'm after taking her out and having some fun.

How early is too early to state intentions here?  Or, in any case? Obviously, it's too early if you've never even talked with the girl (""you're beautiful, will you date me?"").

Just so you know, my plan is to message her (really the only way to get in touch with her) to gauge her interest in meeting up.  If she seems into the idea, then it's number exchanges, hanging out once, then stating intentions.  If she doesn't seem into it, I'll just move on but with a new friend acquired. "
xm85a,4,2012-08-03,[FR] HB8 Customer Service Girl #-Close + K-close (F-close to come),CPaccount,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/xm85a/fr_hb8_customer_service_girl_close_kclose_fclose/,"**&gt;The following is essentially a blueprint for what I do with most customer service girls. I'll practice it on every one of them; but if I'm not attracted to them I won't proceed to a #-close. Practice makes perfect.**

So I went to a large sporting goods store yesterday morning to pick up some compression shorts (for running). The store was almost completely empty.

...When I got to the cash there was one guy currently at the cash. I looked and saw a quite cute girl behind the counter. My age, great body, good face, and a blonde (prefer brunettes but she was still cute).

I saw her make long eye contact with me as I walked up to the cash (while she was helping a customer) so figured there was some mutual interest so started to formulate the started. 

I don't remember the conversation verbatim but this is 99% how it went. It's probably easier to include it with brief explanations so here we go: 

**Her:** Hi! How are you? (smiled and was much more friendly than she was with the other customer; remember enthusiasm is always relative.

**Me:** Hey, good, do you know where XYZ store is? (This was a store in the mall, just down the hall from the one I was in now. I kept eye contact the whole time until she looked away)

**Her:** Um, yeah! If you go out and take a left it's right beside XYZ.

**Me:** I bet since you work in the mall you're a bit of a mall rat and know where everything is, right? (I said this quite flirtatiously and was clearly playing with her)

**Her:** ...Well, maybe it's just because I get people coming in all the time asking me where stores are! (said this back very flirtatiously)

*I then handed her my debit card (one of the old swipe ones, haven't updated to chip yet so it's worn) and she couldn't get it to register.*

*...I took it from her, purposely brushing her hand slightly, and did it on the customer portal and it worked*

**Me:** So I guess I'm better at your job now than you are?

**Her:** Whatever! You know we're hiring people right now? We could use pro-swippers like you.

**Me:** Well, I'm sure you'd *love* to flirt with me all day but I actually work at XYZ. (I'm doing an internship at a bank... doing meaningless work but it always sounds impressive)

**Her:** Oh, well look at you! (said this in a very patronizing (la-te-da) type way)

**Me:** So since you're a mall rat I'm sure you've seen every movie at the theaters. Have you seen the Dark Knight? 

**Her:** Yes! It was *so* good, have you? (I was looking for hints that she was interested, but this was too ambiguous for me to tell)

**Me:** No! Everyone's already seen it so I'm just going to be *that guy* who goes to a movie by his lonesome. (This is stepping back from an alpha role, but I already established one early on so I think this is a fine compliment).

**Her:** Well, it was awesome! I'm sure lots of people would see it twice. (This was still quite ambiguous so wasn't sure if she meant herself, or was just being nice)

*At this time, because she failed to get my card to register so many times, 5-6 receipts came out saying that it failed and was really loud all of a sudden*

**Me:** Geez, enough paper?

**Her:** Yeah, every time I failed to swipe your card it prints a long receipt saying it failed.

**Me:** Well, since you now have all this blank paper you should use it as an opportunity to write your number on it for me.

**Her:** Oh! Should I? (She was grinning ear-to-ear but said should I in a very sarcastic way)

**Me:** Well, in case you ever need my help swiping a debit card. This isn't for personal use, I'm simply trying to help you keep your job! (also said this smiling)

**Her:** I guess I need to then! (Writes down her phone number, I actually forgot my phone - didn't realize at the time - so this worked well)

*There's something about getting a number physically written down that makes it a bit more secretive. Maybe it's memories of middle/high school. But we both seemed to really enjoy it*

The transaction was done (since she wrote her number on my receipt) and I left.

**Note:** I left through the door to the outside, not to the mall. Remember my whole opener was asking where something in the mall was. She didn't seem to pick up on it but word to the wise: remember your story.

*Later that day I texted her (since she didn't have my number):*

**Me:** So Dark Knight tonight at 9pm. Can't say no.

**Her:** Alright! I assume this is the guy from the store? (notice how she felt the need to agree before even knowing it was me)

**Me:** If you're referring to the tall, dark, and handsome guy who flirted with you because he thought you were cute then that's me.

**Her:** LOL well you're confident!

**Me:** Well, you're going out to a movie with a stranger you just met tonight so it must be working. :-)

**Her:** LOL are we just going to meet there?

**Me:** Sure, around 8:45?

**Her:** I'll be around XYZ? Or where??

**Me:** XYZ sounds good. I have to go into work for a bit so I'll just see you then? Later, cutie (didn't have to really work but didn't want to spoil the convo until that night)

...

So we went to see the movie (which was great). Afterwards we walked out, stood by an arcade (since the mall was closed), and talked about the movie.

...She initiated the contact of placing her hand on my chest, just under my heart, and I grabbed her side slightly to pull her in closer. We continued to talk, much closer, and then she leaned in for a kiss.

Wasn't expecting her to initiate so threw me off quite a bit. After about five minutes I told her I had to go and asked if she needed a drive home. She said she drove here. So I walked her to her card, kissed her once more, and then we left.

I think a F-close was in the bag. I'm getting texts from her multiple times a day (often multiple *before* I reply) so she's definitely down to clown.

BUT I'm into a girl (not dating, but imagine we will come September since we both go to the same college) right now who's much more attractive, my type, etc. so I don't know if I just want to get it in. 

Anyway I do this with every service person. Regardless of if they're attractive or not. If I don't find them attractive I simply won't go for the #-close.

...This transaction in particular was good because of my debit card failing which led to a kind of inside story for us to share. 

Just open asking where a store is, gauge their interest, make some clean jokes, move to more sexualized ones, and then go for the #-close.

**Final Note:** There was no customers behind me. Customer service people, if there are other customers, tend to be a bit more reluctant to flirt as it's seen as unprofessional.

xlue4,67,2012-08-03,I've noticed a lot of TOMS hate on this board (in terms of their mission) and wanted to answer some questions.  AMAA,Advocate_OfThe_Devil,malefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/xlue4/ive_noticed_a_lot_of_toms_hate_on_this_board_in/,"So, I did an internship at TOMS a little bit ago for about five months, and I really learned a lot about how they give, and I've seen a lot of criticisms of TOMS, which is great because they love feedback and are always changing how they do things, but I think the vast majority of the issues come from misunderstandings.  I'll give a general outline of how TOMS gives and what they do, and answer things I can.  I won't respond to blanket attacks, but i'll try to address most questions I get--the model isn't perfect (no aid model is), but I can tell you that it is *genuine.*  The employees really want to do good (it's not *just* for business/marketing reasons) and the intentions come from a good place.

**TOMS does not just give shoes away.**
There is this image of TOMS giving that the company drops into some random place, puts shoes on kids' feet, and leaves.  This is how they did their first two giving drops when the company was just a handful of people in an apartment, but the more they learned, the more they realized that this is not a good idea.  Kids grow out of shoes in a few months, children may not actually need/wear the shoes, etc.  The new model of giving, which has been going on for some years now, is going through Giving Partners.  A Giving Parter is a thoroughly vetted NGO who has been working IN a country for years, has a good understanding of the local culture and needs, and can *integrate shoes into their program in a meaningful way.*

For example, a lot of giving partners help children go to school.  In many schools, shoes are part of the uniform and if the children do not wear shoes at school they are either punished (which discourages them from showing up) or even kicked out.  Education centered giving partners receive shoes to distribute to children so that they can attend school for uniform reasons (not to mention walking to school in conditions such as volcanic rock, which tear up the toughest of feet, or muddy roads).

Another example are anti-helminth programs where children are given shoes with deworming efforts.  Hookworm is classified by USAID as a neglected tropical disease and causes amenia and makes children vulnerable to infection more easily (such as by malaria), can stunt growth, and can even retard mental abilities.  Many deworming programs have cut hookworms, but they do not prevent hookworms.  As such, children get reinfected as quickly as the next couple of weeks.  By coupling deworming with shoes, the reinfection between the deworming cycles can be cut drastically.

**TOMS promotes poverty tourism.**  I think in the past TOMS did actually sell tickets to giving trips, but from what I know it did not last that long.  Nobody can attend a giving trip anymore.  TOMS employees do get to go on giving trips after they work there for a year, but these are organized events that are closely tied to the giving partner and is hard volunteer work that helps the giving partner distribute shoes.  Giving partners are not required to host employees, and only those who can truly benefit from their presents are allowed to receive them.

**Giving shoes puts local shoe production out of business.**  The vast majority of children who are receiving TOMS Shoes are not the kinds of children who buy shoes.  They live in the rural, rural parts of Africa, and the only shoes they may have ever worn are ones they have scavenged from dump sites, or made themselves with straw and string (which does little to prevent infection from parasites and cuts).  It is also part of the partner vetting process that the partners research the effect shoes may have on the local economy in regards to their target population.  TOMS is also really interested in seeing if shoe giving can create a shoe-buying/shoe-wearing culture where there isn't one.  There has been feedback from giving partners to suggest as much.

**TOMS giving is part of the white knight problem.**  This isn't really something that TOMS can address, because they are a Western company, but I personally find it ridiculous that I can't have a desire to help people who are less fortunate because I am more fortunate.

**Distributing shoes is costly for NGOs, so gifting them shoes is a burden.**  TOMS actually covers most costs of distribution for the shoes.  So they also financially support the NGOs by fully covering shipping, vehicle rentals, gas, etc.  They even cover volunteers' lunches if necessary.  This also goes towards the idea that people have that the shoes they give must be super cheap, so why does TOMS cost what they do and it's only One for One.  Giving is not cheap.  They reimburse costs, they have to have a whole department that other shoe companies don't have, so that's a lot of more salaries to pay, international shipping is NOT cheap, etc.

**Children grow out of shoes so fast that giving them shoes is useless.**  Giving partners are required to be long-term relationships where they give repeatedly to the same children.  The target timeframe is every six months.

**Why would I spend $55 to give a child shoes when I could just donate $55 dollars to a charity.**  If you're going to donate $55 to an effective charity, DO IT, but that's not the economic tradeoff that the TOMS style of giving is targeting.  Instead, it's about when you will spend $55 on a pair of shoes anyway, why not do it on a shoe that both gets you a shoe *and* helps someone in the process.

I'm sure there were more things I saw out there, but I can't remember them.  If you do not like the style (but they are doing some new and different things these days), that's absolutely fine, but be informed before you make claims that it's ""bad aid.""  Also, the quality of the shoes have definitely gone up over the past year or two.  For example, a lot of people had the problem of their big toe cutting through the canvas.  They've be reengineered so that happens very little now.  I can also answer some questions regarding their eyewear giving if you have them.

Again, I'm not here trying to sell you TOMS, so please be respectful in your questions.  I just want people to understand that TOMS works very hard to understand these criticisms and is constantly changing their giving model to make the biggest impact with the least burden.  The giving is not perfect, but it comes from a genuine desire to make a difference through business solutions. 

DISCLAIMER:  I no longer work for the company.  It may be that some of my information is dated (but it can't be by much), but I'm positive it's all accurate."

WHAT DO I DO?",[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/xlsvz/girlfriend_having_collegelife_crisis_wants_a/,"Background: First time poster, so my girlfriend and I have been dating for 9 months, we fell in love with each other fairly quickly (around 3 months) and things couldn't have been going any better during school. She's a junior, and I'm a senior graduating in fall '12.

I live close to the campus of our school year round in cali, while she lives in arizona during breaks, usually to work or just see family. I've been to visit her family and she's visited mine.

Before the summer she reassured me constantly that nothing will change and that she is worried about me changing my feelings if anything. I loved her and knew she loved me so I was comfortable with us being apart. About 5 weeks into the summer, we went on a weekend getaway together (the first time seeing her since early june, vacation was in mid july) and she broke all the news to me. 

She wants a break, for the following reasons:

1) She doesn't like that i'm talking to her about my real life situation and real life job and long term work cause she can't keep up. She said she's barely 21 and can't even go out yet and i'm already talking to her about jobs and money. It's stressing her out and making her think so far yet she is so young and should not be thinking so far ahead yet. She barely knows what she wants to do. She's barely getting by right now with school. Me telling her my situation is getting her too stressed out. That she has to be on my level too with money and work discussion stuff. But she can't.

2) She feels too un independent. She depends on people too much for her problems. She can't handle things on her own and she wants to learn how to be independent. She doesn't want to depend on her bf all the time but doesn't know how to stray away from it since she's always in one. She thinks we got so serious so fast, which i dont think is true, and that's scaring her because shes so young.

3) It's stressful for her to try and talk to me and work at the same time. She's working a full time internship for the first time in her life that requires an hour train ride, 1 mile walk, and then work 8 hours, same commute home. So she's up at 5:30 every morning, and just can't handle the long days on top of her internship workload. Besides this internship, she's also taking summer classes that are very time consuming. It stresses her out to think about work and then think about talking to me afterwards since she has no time to breathe. Yes it's temporary but she is having a lot of trouble managing time.

4) At social events I'm too quiet just talking to friends while she's dancing and singing. She loves to be loud and have fun but she feels like she cannot share that excitement with me.
This was all received by a close friend of hers that told me this because you can always get the best scoop from best friends. I'm 100% promised by her friends and her that there is no other guy, so that's not it.

What I want: I love her! Even now she says she still loves me, she is just freaking out about her life and our relationship is taking the heat for it. Some of her friends think that we can be saved, others think its over. I just want to make her happy and I know we can still be happy together. She said to me that she wishes she had met me when she was graduating too and that we started dating then.
It's hard now because I wont see her again until school starts, so how do I save our relationship? Can I? I am desperately in need of some advice. HELP!

tl;dr: college girlfriend is afraid that since i'm graduating and shes still in school that things will change, she's afraid of being in such a committed relationship so young, and being apart this summer has really stressed her out. How do I save the relationship?!

EDIT: Has anyone been in this situation and saved their relationship? IF SO HOW!"

So I'm in Safford, finishing up an internship. My last day is on Friday, August 10th; my friend is driving up to Phoenix that day to meet up with his parents. I figured that since I'll be in the city, I ought to explore it! So I booked my flight for 2:50 on Saturday afternoon to give myself time to romp around a bit.

My plan, so far, is this: Arrive in Phoenix on Friday afternoon (not sure what time yet), see The Dark Knight Rises in IMAX and maybe check out other stuff on Friday night, crash at a hotel, then spend Saturday morning checking out the city until I go to Sky Harbor (which I ought to get to around 1 PM).

Here are my questions:

- Where's a good place to see TDKR? I've had Cine Capri recommended to me by a guy from Tucson.
- I don't have a car, and I'm too young to rent one. Will Valley Metro be able to get me around the city well enough, and can I buy a day pass?
- Based on the transportation situation, would you recommend getting a hotel near downtown or near Sky Harbor?
- What food's good? I'm thumbing through some of the recommendations already on r/phoenix, though that's difficult since you guys recommend something different every time!
- Is there something in Phoenix that I definitely have to see?
- Any other tips?

Thank you so much, you guys!"

xldiy,1,2012-08-02,Help: someone kissed me and I need advice,[deleted],dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/xldiy/help_someone_kissed_me_and_i_need_advice/,"I apologize if this is long. But background information is needed.  When I met Bob (name changed for obvious reasons, he Reddits sometimes) I was 19 and he was 23. He worked at my college at our mailroom where I was often.  Being an out of state student I got a lot of mail and packages and saw him often.  I became accustomed to friendly chats with him and the other employees.  At the end of Freshman year I finally gave him my number.  

I went home for the summer and we kept in touch.  The next year again the same thing: I saw him often, we texted, chatted and hung out once and awhile.  At the time I was living with four other girls so it was hard to get some alone time.  At the end of the semester we finally got a chance for some one-on-one time when I moved into a studio by myself.  He helped me move. One day we were in my apartment sitting on my blow up mattress (the only thing I had in the place at the time) and he kissed me.

After that we chatted and hung out a bit more. But, he became distant and as the summer wore on and I got steadily into my internship, we kind of dropped off the map.  As Junior year started, I didn't see him except once a month when I went into get stamps.

At this time I was pretty much friends with everyone working at his job including the boss. So I hung out behind the counter and chatted with the guys and went on cig breaks with them when I would visit. Our friendship started to pick up again.  Then during the Spring semester he informed me that he had moved in with a girl whom he'd been seeing since August.

I was happy for him because our romance had fizzled out and he deserved a nice girl.  Well come 3 months ago he proposes and they get engaged. Everything was good for awhile. I met her. She was nice. But 2- 3 weeks ago she broke off the engagement.  No word about why or what happened. He didn't know. She won't talk to him. She went as far as to get movers to take his stuff to his parents house.

So in these last 2 -3 weeks we have been hanging out a lot. We are good friends and I just wanted to help him get over the break-up.  I know him well and he would probably have just sat alone at home and been all sad-pants if not for his friends taking him out.

He informed me several days ago that he was going to jump back in the saddle, I thought this was quick, and go on a date with a girl from a dating website.  He told me about it later on, that it was nice but they weren't going to see each other again.

On Tuesday night he came to my place with my next door neighbor/best friend to watch the olympics. We ordered pizza, hung out, watched T.V. After we finished eating I went to sit on the bed because my apartment is small and the couch only fits 2 people. So he came over and sat with me. We cuddled a little, which is not unusual for us. 

After my neighbor left, he stayed. We hung out in my bed, watched bad late night t.v. and cuddled and talked. So, I flipped over during a commercial to talk to him. And all of a sudden BAM he kisses me out of the blue. He was super tense and nervous about it. I could tell, seeing as I've kissed him before. 

So anyway I bust out laughing and so does he. We kiss again and everything is okay. He still seems tense. He stayed for an hour or so more and eventually left to walk home. So, here comes my issue:

Was this kiss because we are both lonely and we just happened to be there, spur of the moment thing?
He really likes me but it was never the right time for ""Us""
Or am I just a rebound to this guy after his fiance broke up with him?

I don't know what to do reddit. I need advice!

TL;DR Friend kissed me, after his fiance broke up with him.

Edit: for proper ages he's 27, I'll be 22 in a month."
xohpk,0,2012-08-04,What are some risks when moving to New York City?,Bellacar,nyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/xohpk/what_are_some_risks_when_moving_to_new_york_city/,"Though this might sound weird, stupid,etc. but It's my dream to live in New York. 

It started about 4 years ago when I first went on a family vacation. About 2 years later I stayed with my aunt for a month during which I had an internship and everything was amazing. I was able to work and live in the city without the burden of finances. It was also when I met my current boyfriend. Since then I have visited New York 3 times(once driving there) and I will be visiting again next week. 

I feel like I know the city well enough to not be considered a tourist (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong). I know the subways as well as the etiquette while traveling in the city. I've been to each of the boroughs and I have not encountered any problems with anybody or anything. I have a support system in New York that would help me whenever I need it, family that lives in Brooklyn and a boyfriend that lives in The Bronx.

My goal if to get to the city by first attending school there (CUNY) and living on campus the first year or so until I am able to financially afford a place on my own or with friends. So I'm able to integrate better.

I want the blessing of my parents and I know that it would be best if I know the risks of moving into the city.

I understand there are risks when moving half-way across the country like getting sick, or not being able to pay for something. But I would like to know the risks specific to New York City.

If you have questions feel free to ask, Thank you in advance for your help!"

xnffa,5,2012-08-03,Need Advice on Independence,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/xnffa/need_advice_on_independence/,"I'm having a hard time being independent, and even figuring out how independent I want to be. I'm 20, and going to an expensive private college for biology. My parents are paying for it, besides scholarships and a few student loans I'll have to pay back. My parents are paying for my rent. My parents are paying for my food. I have a job, but it's as a substitute receptionist, and the hours are never stable. Most of the money from it goes to books/gas. I have applied to literally 32 other jobs this summer, at McDonalds, Starbucks, Walmart, restaurants, nanny agencies, botanical gardens, *anywhere*, with no success. Nobody wants to hire a college student who will only be able to work weekends in the fall. My parents say not to worry about it, they know I'm trying to get a job, and that they have no problem paying for things. Great.

The problem is I'm not sure how much I want to be depend on my parents. My dad's an alcoholic. He's also hit me a few times, sometimes rather seriously. He hasn't touched me for a few years, but he hasn't apologized, and he hasn't changed. I know if he got angry enough, he'd do it again. I love my mom and the rest of my family. They know my dad's an alcoholic, but only my mom and sister know about the hitting. We all kind of ignore it, and the rest of my family doesn't seem to take it very seriously. I don't think I could cut my dad out without losing everyone else I love too.

I've only gotten to the point where I've started to take it seriously. I used to think it was my fault until I started seeing a therapist (which my parents are also paying for). I used to think I was trapped like this and it was something I had to ignore because I couldn't do anything about it. I still don't know what to do. I don't want to lose the rest of my family. I want to keep going to college, and not have to drop out to support myself. My boyfriend knows about what happened and absolutely hates my dad. This is threatening my family's policy of ignoring the state of things, because my parents keep wanting to invite him over for dinner. My boyfriend's not the type of person to stay quiet when he hates someone, especially when it comes to me. So far I've been able to keep the two parties apart.

But I want my boyfriend AND my family (minus my dad) to be part of my life. I just see no way to do it. My sister got out of it by going to grad school across the country. She's been very lucky with internships though, and can support herself, but she never gets to see the rest of my family. I miss her very much. My sister and my boyfriend both support themselves, and they really inspired me to make my life mine.

I don't know why I'm posting this here. You guys just have always made me feel comfortable, and I guess it is about being a strong, independent woman :P. I don't really know what answers I want either. I just wanted to talk to *someone*.

tl;dr: Financially dependent on abusive father, especially for college. Want to keep rest of family in my life"
xqjhh,40,2012-08-05,How to get escorted off a plane with United without doing anything wrong at all - it's a long story.,megalodon92,travel,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/xqjhh/how_to_get_escorted_off_a_plane_with_united/,"All you need to know about me is this: I live in Upstate New York, I had a summer internship in Michigan, and I have family in Southern California.

Back in April I bought a round trip flight with United Airlines for my internship. The return flight to Syracuse (Grand Rapids-Cleveland-Syracuse) was scheduled for August 4. Then partway through the summer I decided to go to California with my family and bought a ticket for the same day, but
 it was cheaper to buy a new roundtrip flight through American Airlines than it was to change the United flight so I bought the California one (Syracuse-Chicago-Orange County) for later in the afternoon on August 4. I figured I'd meet up with my mom, say hi and give her some stuff I didn't need and then fly on to California.

So in the morning on Saturday August 4 I set out for Grand Rapids, checked in with United - they gave me both my ticket for Cleveland and for Syracuse, all ready to go - and in texting my parents I got this weird text from my mom - u r flying rite 2 cali. I had NO idea what she was talking about so I called her and she said, “Your Cleveland-Syracuse flight got canceled, United called the house yesterday and said they were going to call you.” I have no idea how they got my home phone number, and that hasn't been useful to me in over a year because I’ve been studying abroad and not home at all, but they never called me, never emailed me, nothing. So then my dad is calling them again while I'm trying to find someone in the godforsaken Grand Rapids airport - there is ONE person working there for United and he says he can't help me right now because he is boarding the Cleveland flight and I said no, you need to help me right now because I either need to get on this flight or not. And he won't help me so I leave and go back to the check-in desk outside of the secure area to get them to fix it.

I explain to the guy at the ticket desk what's going on, and he brings out a lady who must be higher up than him because obviously it's all too complex for him to understand. She says our contract with you is to get you to Syracuse not California. I say yes, but your contract was also to get me there at a specific time and you cancelled the flight that would get me there on time so I could make my next flight and get to Orange County. She says well we'll have American Airlines fix this for you and prints me an itinerary for American that says now Grand Rapids-Chicago-Syracuse and then I can get on my American Airlines flight - Syracuse-Chicago-Orange County. I say fine - they basically passed me off so that I can't yell at them and get anything else out of them - and go to the American desk. The man there is really nice and fixes it so I just go Grand Rapids-Chicago-Orange County. So I fly to Chicago and it's all sorted out.

My brother, sister, cousin and grandmother are also in Chicago, flying with United of all things, leaving a good 6 hours earlier than me, and I know that United owes me compensation for the canceled flight so I figure I'll try and get on that flight, I might as well try and save my grandmother a trip to the airport late at night. So I go to the customer service desk for United and there's a huge line and so I call customer service while I'm in the line. The woman I spoke with gets me exactly what I want, says my itinerary is now changed for Orange County and I just need to print my boarding pass for this flight at 3pm local time. I thank her and thank her saying she's the first person with United who's been any help to me all day. So I have the lady at the desk print it for me and I'm all set to go. I get on the plane, no issue, sitting a good 20 or so rows ahead of my family and right as we're about to take off a security woman comes down the aisle, addresses me by name and says, “You need to come with me. You have not paid for this flight and you need to be going to Syracuse. You cannot go to another state Orange County is in another state.”

And I said I know exactly where Orange County is and where Syracuse is but I've already sorted this out and I have my boarding pass, it's right here, United printed it out for me just 20 minutes ago. And she said no look and she points to four letters at the top of the ticket - PTKT - and says that makes it not valid and it means you haven't paid for this flight. I ask if anyone else was scheduled to be in this seat and she said no but you still can't sit there we can't take you to Orange County for free. I say you aren't taking me for free I paid you $420 for my flight months in advance. She says I need to go now and I figure I could get myself in much hotter water than I am already so I get my stuff and go.

So my family still hasn't noticed what's going on because they're so far back and I yell to my sister as I'm standing in the aisle getting my bag, ""HEY, I'll make it to California. ENJOY YOUR FLIGHT EVERYONE."" As I exit the plane I say to one of the stewardesses, “Would you mind at least explaining to my family why you've taken me off the plane? And then I'm standing in the jetway expecting to talk my way back onto the plane. The woman says I need to go to Syracuse. I said, “If you had actually done your homework you'd see that your company cancelled my flight from CLEVELAND, not Chicago, to Syracuse over 24 hours ago, and this is how the woman on the phone fixed it for me, because you ruined my travel plans and made it impossible for me to get from Syracuse to Orange County on time.” She kept saying ""Syracuse and Orange County are in different states"" and I said I KNOW. Then it started to dawn on me how long I'd been on the defensive, and I was tired and frustrated, and I burst into tears.

“You humiliated me in front of a hundred people, you took me away from my family, I haven't seen them in over a year between school and travel and work and I just want to go with them to see my aunt in California.” They escort me out of the jetway and I follow a guy in a dumb looking suit to the desk in front of the gate and say how are you going to fix this? And he says I'm printing you a boarding pass for Chicago-Syracuse. This gets me into Syracuse at 9pm. I say, “Have you not been listening to me? This is absolutely useless to me. My flight from Syracuse to CHICAGO is leaving at 4 pm IN ONE HOUR.” He said, “You'll have to figure it out with American Airlines from there. I tell him that I and other customers pay United an awful lot to be treated like livestock.” I take the boarding pass but go back to the American Airlines counter and ask if the boarding pass I was given in the morning, the one for Santa Ana at 6:50 pm, is actually a boarding pass and if I'll be able to get on the plane, and they say yes your boarding pass is valid. I say thank you and find a corner with some carpet and nap for a while, read a bit, and cry now and then because I'm just stressed out and tired of being alone.

That flight is delayed about an hour but sure enough I get on the plane and it leaves the ground without anyone coming on and making a fool of me. I get into California around 10pm West Coast time - I have now been awake for almost 20 hours - and my aunt picks me up and takes me to the house where I pass out on the couch for the night. Now I’m with family and I’m glad to be, but I want justice. I want to spread this story and give United Airlines the publicity it deserves, and I hope the Internet can help me out with that.

*Maybe if I was an Olympic athlete, they would have treated me better?*

**TL;DR: I tried to get my flight changed with United Airlines after they cancelled one of my flights, they printed me a boarding pass and I got on the plane, they escorted me off saying I hadn't paid.**"
xqgpl,7,2012-08-05,Things I've Learned From My Relationship,iwuvfatcatz,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/xqgpl/things_ive_learned_from_my_relationship/,"Relationship: 5-6 months. SO: 21M. Myself: 22F. Both college students graduating in 2013. We just broke up for good today. We semi-broke up a week ago, but we both caved and got back together the next day. But he just couldn't be happy anymore. So today, we both broke up.

He [21] was my best friend. And he still is. He helped me after a bad break up with my ex-boyfriend. And we soon got together after that. I don't consider him my rebound. Of the three, he was the best boyfriend I've ever had. But this summer, he started his internship 3 hours away so I only see him on the weekends. He realized that he's not ready for a serious relationship yet. It's too scary for him. And he has an abusive controlling side that tends to creep out on those closed to him. But I think it's more of that fact that he realizes how much work and commitment a relationship requires. He's not ready for it.

Earlier on in the relationship, he tells me he loves me, but recently, he stopped saying it and freaks out at the l-word. Because to him, love is forever, and he's not ready for it. We just broke up today and I found out that he never loved me. He did ""liked me a lot once"". I know I love him. And even thought of the possibility of the future. I was willing to go for as long as possible and just be with him forever. I wasn't against the idea of marrying him one day in the far far future when we're both ready for it. But that scares him. 

We've made a couple of mistakes during the relationship. I have learned things about myself and about relationships.

* **We went too fast.** We were seriously in love when we started and I'm his first girlfriend. We spent all of our free time together. We saw each other almost every night, whether at the library studying or at his place. **I learn that it's important to pace the relationship better in the beginning so that you don't burn out so quickly.** We started to run out of things to do together. We stopped having proper dates. And when it could have been, he starts inviting all of us friends into it. I never said anything because I still enjoyed hanging out with him and I like his friends. But I got fewer alone time with him unless it was a booty call/sexy time.

* **We became each other's whole world, especially myself.** He was my everything and I slowly saw my friends less. We always hung out with his friends since my friends didn't like him. **Keep your friends around to keep yourself around.** My friends are a good reminder of who I am and they know me well. I started to lose myself and became him. I didn't know who I was anymore. I didn't have any friends of my own. He was my best friend. Now I sit here after the break up with nobody's shoulders to cry on. I don't want to go to my friends right now because I don't want to hear ""I told you so"". I don't want to hear from my family either. He was the first boyfriend whom I was serious enough to talk about to my traditional Asian parents. They accepted him because he was a smart, nice, responsible boy. My mom was thinking about how I should find a job in the Silicone Valley with him after I graduate. (We're both engineers.) Now I have to tell my mom that we broke up. I lost my hobbies. I lost my friends. Now I'm all alone.

* **I don't know what a non-serious relationship is.** We tried a week of being a ""non-serious relationship"" but I honestly don't know what that means. When I date someone, I'm pretty serious about them. I try and try so hard to keep it going, but sometimes, you can't save it. I don't date for sex. I don't date for free dinners. I don't date out of boredom. When I date someone, it's because I see a possibility of the future with them and I want to see how far this relationship can go. If he's the one and we end up making it all that way, then it's great. However, I'm not going to push marriage. We're both young. I don't want to get married until at least my late-20's. But I think I'm just too serious...I'm probably clingy too....

* **I don't think I want to date anyone until at least after my college graduation.** I don't know where life takes me. I'm not limiting my job opportunity to just California. I'm willing to move if an offer is too good to turn down. **I need some serious me-time to heal and become stronger and better.**

What was great about the break up was that we are still both supportive of each other and wish the best for one another in the future. He still wants to be friends and I am open to it, but I told him I'll need some time before I can exit girlfriend mode. 

We spent the day walking through campus after lunch and after I told him that I agree that we both need to break up since I knew he was unhappy and I don't want to force him in a relationship. It felt like a normal day, just making jokes everywhere we went. But it also hurt, because everywhere we went, I recalled a good memory with him there. It hurts to let him go, but I'm glad we both have tons of good memories to look back on. We both were good sports about the break up. 

He will still be my best friend, but I just can't see him for a while. To me, my best friend is going on a long vacation and I won't see him for a long time. But I know he still cares about me. I still care about him too.

xqg1k,4,2012-08-05,"My afternoon with ""spiritual scientists""",thelunaticinthehall,atheism,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/xqg1k/my_afternoon_with_spiritual_scientists/,"A little background: I just started working at an office a few weeks back, and had developed a friendly relationship with some of my fellow co-workers. A few of them have many tattoos, but are required by the management to cover them with sleeves. 

Anyway, one of these workers is a new intern, who is all about conspiracy theories. Well, I sit down to pick his brain, and first I ask him about the moon landing. He tells me that we did in fact make it to the moon, but the government released faked pictures because there were actually pyramids on the moon, just like the ones of mars and earth. So this guy is a whacko. 

Well, one day they invite me to smoke with them on a weekend and watch these conspiracy videos. I wanted to see what else this kid had in store, so I accepted.

A few days earlier, I realized that many of the employees are very Christian, as I had a debate with a Chik-fil-a supporter and revealed I am an atheist. Which got me wondering as I was driving to the arranged apartment, if the guy who's house it was, would, joking to myself, have a huge tattoo of a cross. 
I was correct, when I arrived to see his whole right arm covered in a large cross that read ""Psalm 28:7"". ""what have I gotten myself into?"" I thought.

We go inside, and this guy is still very chill and I had liked him from working with him, so I thought, ""hey, I'm friendly with this guy, so I'll just keep an open mind today."" Well the other guy (conspiracy) shows up, and we smoke, and he proceeds to put [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkTccU8x7a4) on, IMMEDIATELY. There was no after sesh, conversation, he just turns on the tv and loads this video. (skip to around 15 minutes, to see what I was dealing with). So the whole time this thing is playing, about an hour, I'm thinking, shit this dude really is a whackjob, with the video mentioning ""the return to dow"" and straight up saying, we will return to one on DECEMBER FREAKING 21ST 2012! while depicting someone arising to what seemed to be heaven. At this point, I asked him to pause the movie, and asked, ""is this really a 2012 conspiracy video?"" and this kid, who seemed to just ramble in the typical fashion of a deranged lunatic, assured me that it would all be explained. Eventually, the video went on to say how the world is spiraling through space following the sun, and that we are entering a new space of ""higher vibrational patterns"", which will improve out lives vastly. At this point, I'm counting the minutes till this ends (as I was way to high to drive, and had said I was leaving at a certain time). The video also mentioned that we are living on certain pre-destined paths of a divine plan, and the only way we can change our lives, is to change from fear to any other emotion (shown on a rainbow?) which will result in us living in another vibrational field. I asked them to stop the video at one point, ""to take a break and stretch our legs. And I put the olympics on, and we just chilled, and the two went back to normal. After what seemed like a finish of this spiritual propaganda, the conspiracy theorist, puts on another cartoon series, telling me its about the planets, but turns out to be a series called ""Spirit Science"". And he plays an episode about these things called ""[Chakras](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppTq5XRk35g&amp;feature=relmfu)"". This shit is so unbelievable, and it was really the most uncomfortable I've ever felt in my life. We ended up watching another hour of this series before I left. Sorry for the wall of text, but I really needed to get this out there. 


**TL;DR** smoked with guys from work who turned out to be religious spiritual weirdos, who show me strange youtube videos about how science proves religion.

EDIT: The conspiracist also believes global warming is a hoax, and that the earth, and all planets are hollow. We actually debated this. And he shrugged me off to be the crazy one"
xqem8,1,2012-08-05,I (24/m) am confused with my relationship with GF (24/f) please help Reddit!!,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/xqem8/i_24m_am_confused_with_my_relationship_with_gf/,"Ok so I've been with my GF for coming up to 5 years. It got insanely serious very quickly. On the one hand we love ach other very much and on the other hand we are like best friends.

I used to be very jealous of her (very inexperienced) past, but she understood. After college finished she went to another country to start an internship. We were 3 years into the relationship.  Eventually after several months I found a job in the same country, when I arrived she broke up with me and revealed she had cheated on me. After a while we sort of got back together, basically lived together and tried to rebuild things. A month into this I fell for a girl and broke up with my kinda ex GF. The new girl turned out to be a psycho and I ended it when she told me I should marry her because if not her mother would marry her to an older guy (common in the country she's from). 
Got back with the ex again. She moved in again. I found filthy texts on her phone from before she said she cheated. I went mad, hacked my arms to pieces with a kitchen knife as I ran down my building's corridor in my underwear screaming (picture Pat Bateman). I threw her out. She was due to fly home for a week to see family the next day. She left as planned and I spent a week on a drink and hooker fuelled binge. 
She comes back and I discover the dirty texts where part of a joke with a gay co worker. 
We fixed everything and now a year on we have what seems to be a normal and functioning relationship. We live together, have jobs, and do the whole couple life together. 
Recently though I've discovered that I feel zero jealousy, like about her past, about what happened or even if she kissed or fucked someone. I still love her though. 
Before everything happened I wanted the whole marriage thing and to settle down. That's gone now. 
We get along great, no fights or anything, no fall outs, but we haven't had sex in nearly 2 months and honestly, I've no desire to. I probably fap too much, but then again I alway have done. 
Imused to be a very guilty person, like I would feel guilt for everything. I fapped I felt bad that I'd betrayed her, if I danced with a girl I'd feel bad. If I flirted mildly I'd feel like I'd cheated. Every little thing imaginable I'd feel bad, obsess for weeks and then break down and confess to her. I should mention I have OCD, possibly am borderline and suffer from general anxiety disorder. Was on anti depressants since I was 13 and during our breakmups was on seroquel (anti psychotic meds). About a month ago I began to like a married woman at work and drunkenly kissed her at a work party. I didn't tell my girlfriend and for the first time in my life barely felt guilty. 
Now part of me is very jealous of single guys who get to go out and get the 'thrill of the chase', get to flirt around and generally have fun. I'm going on holiday with my family soon, while my girlfriend stays at work. Part of me is hoping to get the opportunity to meet a girl on holiday and have a sort of fling. I'm unsure if I would feel guilty or if afterwards I'd instantly regret it and die from guilt and self loathing. 
The thing is, I couldn't imagine life without my girlfriend. We get along so well, and genuinely enjoy each others company and a big part of cannot lose this.
I'm almost in the frame of mind of thinking that if only I could take 6 months break, and go a bit crazy, I could go back into the relationship with a clear head and be ready to settle down. I've only ever been in serious relationships and never fucked a girl outside of a relationship (apart from the street whores obviously). This is clearly not a reasonable thing to ask of a girl, I would have to choose her or being single.
I do really love her, and I want that spark back that we had. We used to fuck like bunnies, talk about marriage etc etc. Now I feel stupid and self conscious when we have sex, I can't fart in front of her (small thing but she commented once when I confessed this, and seemed offended). I've lost a lot of my physical attraction for her. I'm rambling now, but what do you think Reddit?

Tl;dr: great relationship hit hard times. Back together for nearly 2 years now and started to feel confused with what I want."

I'm new to this subreddit and I posted this before but didn't get any responses and I'm still pretty nervous and I apologize if there are a million other posts like this asking for help but allow me to give some background. I'm a rising senior at a good engineering/business school majoring in BIS and right now I'm in Colombia about to start an internship at a large gourmet coffee manufacturing company in the IT dept/database admin department as well.

Since I'm still in college I haven't actually used any SAP software before; I think I know the basics, but I was hoping for any advice I can get about working with SAP or ERP systems, interning at cities in Colombia/South American business differences, or anything else to look out for that would usually come up during an internship like this.
Some facts: 1. This is my first internship so I don't have any technical experience working in IT before 2. I am more or less fluent in Spanish already
Help is greatly appreciated! Even if you don't know anything about South American SAP systems any advice would help! Thanks!"
xqb7f,5,2012-08-05,[19/F] I love my boyfriend (28/M) but am so afraid love won't be enough to overcome lack of ambition/education,sinhazinha,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/xqb7f/19f_i_love_my_boyfriend_28m_but_am_so_afraid_love/,"My boyfriend and I have been together over a year and our families have been friends for over 8 years. I have no problems at all with our relationship itself. He makes me profoundly happy and the idea of him being the only man in my life is something that makes me smile. He's supportive, honest, intelligent and many other good things. My friends, family, and acquaintances all love him and no one can deny that he's helped me overcome some things I don't think i ever would have by myself. 

However. He can't seem to get his education or employment together. He has been taking classes off and on at a community college for 10 years now, and just failed a course. He left his comfy city job (which he held down for a long time) to try and change his course. He worked at an office job for over a year, but was fired about 4 months ago (to be fair, the CEO fires people pretty frequently and almost everyone that was there when he arrived was gone by the time he was fired). He wants to be an aircraft mechanic, but I don't see this happening. He feels horrible about the grades and the lack of job, so it's not like he doesn't care, he's just not doing it. I'm in an engineering college, with a 3.8 gpa, making a decent amount of money working as a computer technician and pursuing internships. I'm scared our difference in ambition and education are going to hurt us in the future. However, thinking about the future, he is the father I would want for my kids and the friend I'd want in old age. I wonder if I should just accept the role I will take on as breadwinner and be cool with that. Also, because I lived in a group home for a while, one of my biggest goals in life is to adopt from the foster-care system and he is AMAZING with kids (he worked with them for 10 years at his city job and before with his church), so it might be good that he doesn't have an intense career if we end up needing a parent to stay home. 

I'm also not the easiest person to deal with and am extremely driven to the point that I burn myself out. He's helped me find balance in my life, but I can't seem to help him find balance in his own.

What the fuck do I do? I'm scared that our relationship will be hurt by the clear difference in education and ambition, but I'm also scared it would be the worst mistake to let him go. Has any one been here before? How'd it turn out? I'd especially like to hear if it worked or didn't long term. "

After speaking to him for a bit I found out he was Catholic so being Athiest I tried to kind of logically argue him down but it didn't really work. 

So I asked him what he thought about gay people he said it was wrong, unnatural and a choice. I told him the next day about what I went through and how it isn't but he just won't believe me. Each time I got him to a point where he can't argue back he just walked away like the deluded coward he is.

I have to work with him and live in the same flat and at the moment we just don't talk at all. I think he finds it easier and whistles all the time being happy with himself since I don't make him question his faith and he can't see anything wrong with the way he is thinking.

I just can't stand hanging around or even talking to a person who thinks like this. We walk the same way to work separately and they all expect us to be friends at the office with no idea what is going on. They force us to socialise on work nights out that I have to go on.

The whole situation is kind of getting me depressed and losing faith in people. I hate seeing him thinking he is happy when he doesn't know how much of a hateful thing he is thinking.

I feel like I'm going to crack and resent him so much.

**How do I deal with this situation?**

*TLDR: Have to live in the same flat and work with a Catholic guy who thinks homosexuality is wrong, a choice and unnatural. This is getting me kind of depressed and we aren't talking at all after I told him where we stand with each other. I have to see him everyday.*"
xpj86,4,2012-08-05,Repost with PROOF. The story of how President Obama gave my little brother the best birthday ever.,PrezBdaythrowaway,politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/xpj86/repost_with_proof_the_story_of_how_president/,"*Original Post:*
Apologies in advance, this is long. Here goes:

I used to work for a volunteer organization that supports President Obama (Organizing for America). The president was coming to town to do an event one spring, and it just so happened to be the day of my little brother's birthday. I told him to write me off for the day, as I'd likely be very busy, but then I got a call asking if I knew some people that would be willing to drive in the President's motorcade. They asked for fit, young people to drive and asked for roughly 10 or more drivers.
At the time I had been inundated with requests from volunteers, politicians, etc. for tickets to the event, so this was a chance to reward some deserving people. I supplied a list of hard-working interns, active volunteers and community activists who were either young, fit, or experienced drivers. And my brother, because he volunteered sometimes and it was his birthday for heaven's sake.

After a Secret Service background check, all of my people were accepted to the motorcade. My brother's job was to be dressed like a boss and sit in the press van all day with (heavily) armed agents and some media folks.

My thought is, that after I've done my job for the day, seen to all of my volunteers, etc.. that I'll see if I can get the President to sign a birthday card for my little brother. Sadly, just after I met him myself, I was informed by his staff that they don't let him sign birthday cards. I think the devastation on my face was apparent, so the guy took the card and offered to see what he could do. I gave him my brother's name and thanked him.

Maybe and hour later he returns and passes me the card. There's no signature, but inside it is a ticket to the event, embossed with the Whitehouse logo, the name and date of the event and a sharpie signature from Barack Obama that says Happy Birthday, (brother's name). Of course, I am beyond thrilled and treat this bookmark shaped piece of paper like 1,000 year old parchment.

Skipping ahead, I catch up to my brother later to give him his card (with the signed ticket inside) when he tells me his story. Not only did Barack sign the ticket, he was told that one of his drivers was having a birthday that day. He found out who it was, approached my brother and said, ""Hey (brother's name), I hear it's your birthday today. Happy Birthday."" He went on thanking my brother for being there on his b-day and generally being a fantastic guy. He pulled all the drivers from the motorcade aside and took a picture with them (which his people dutifully mailed out later) and let my brother get a picture with the Presidential Limo.

He made my day, my brother's day, and the day of every single person he met. Maybe it's just the smart thing to do, in which case I thank him for being wise. Maybe it's just thoughtful in which case I thank him for his consideration. Maybe it's just kindness in which case I thank him for being kind. I think it's all of the above and more.

TL;DR- President Obama personally wished my brother a happy birthday and gave me a keepsake to help my brother remember the occasion. Best birthday ever for a young man to be wished a happy birthday by the most powerful man in the world.

xphwg,3,2012-08-05,Might be an odd place for this kind of post - but I have career woes that I need help with!,praiserang,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/xphwg/might_be_an_odd_place_for_this_kind_of_post_but_i/,"Warning: Wall-of-text ahead

I decided to post this here because I'm a really big (lurking) fan of this subreddit - I posted to /r/careers before and didn't really get any good insight, and this subreddit is chock full of smart and shrewd people - although this place doesn't usually typically cover career matters beyond where one's income is directed, I'm hoping some older and wiser folks can give me some good advice!

My story: 22 y/o, graduated from a top-50 liberal arts school in May with a biochemistry and music degree. I hate to contribute to the glut of self-entitled white liberal-arts-degree-having 20-somethings in this country who move home to 'figure it out,' but the shoe somewhat fits. Not entirely though: I'm not unemployed and I did get a good (for now) job right out of school - working at a biotech company as a lab technician. Moreover, I like to think I'm not entitled; I came from modest means, paid for a good chunk of school with scholarship money, and I made the most of my education - worked my ass off to burn-out proportions, and finished 3rd in my college class with a near 4.0 gpa and highest honors. The living at home thing is temporary.

My problem is that I'm having a really hard time making my academic efforts translate into a smart, clear, and fulfilling post-college plan.When I entered school, although I didn't know what I wanted to 'do with my life,' I thought I was doing the right thing by by committing to a hard-science degree. As I began to finish up my studies, though, I realized that neither of the two typically proscribed paths for an undergraduate science degree - research or medicine - seemed right for me. Both are within my reach, and given the right effort into taking the relevant exams, I *could* pursue either, but I don't feel good about it. I'm very happy with the critical thinking skills and foundational way of thinking my science education offered me, but I don't know how much farther I want to take it.

After a couple internships and writing an undergraduate thesis based on research I did in a biochem lab, you couldn't pay me to do science research: I find science research to be incredibly unfulfilling and I want absolutely nothing to do with that life-path, so I think getting a PhD and pursuing a career in science academia or in the biotech/pharma industry is off the table.

As far as medicine goes, I'm a little more open to it, and I am going to take my MCAT just to have the option open, but if I'm honest with myself, I really don't have any interest in going to med school and becoming a physician. I feel like my decision to go to med-school would be based on not knowing what else to do, and I think that is a pretty awful reason to make such an enormous commitment.

So the issue is this: After four years of blind and aimless ambition - working hard and overachieving for nothing but the sake of working hard - I feel like kind of a desultory schmuck with no plan and little direction. I feel like I should have maybe taken time off before college to really decide what it is I wanted to do. If I'm honest with myself, I really don't know what I'm passionate about, and the only things that I'm really certain of are the things that I don't want to be doing.

I feel like every conversation I have had with profs/adults/friends has revolved around the same vague advice: 'You'll be fine,' 'There are so many different jobs out there you can do with a science degree,' 'Companies don't care what you majored in, just what kind of candidate you are and that you're smart'

This does nothing for me: I feel like I have no idea where to start with making a career move, and I worry that I won't have any relevant experience or skills to try and get into any non-science career.

So I'm wondering if anybody here has some words of wisdom. A degree and a career are investments after all. I guess I'm just interested in gaining some perspective on what I could possibly pursue. One of my strategies has been to look for jobs at great companies that hire on general grounds (e.g. positions with qualifications that require a general 4-year degree and strong academic track-record) where the company is looking more for a good fit and then they invest in training you once you join. For instance some marketing/sales jobs at google have loose qualifications like that, but listings like these seem few and far between and I don't really know where to find other opportunities like this.

So to any old and wise redditors, I'm curious to now how I should navigate this post-college transition, how I should begin to pursue career options with a science background if I don't want to pursue science, and how to seek out quality job (internship?) opportunities that will bring a little more breadth to my experience and help me to figure out what exactly I want to be doing. I'm definitely a little lost, and I'm curious to hear from those who have successfully and happily figured out their career trajectories.

Hope this all made sense, and again, sorry if this is a bit off-topic.

tl;dr quarter-life crisis, don't know what I'm doing with myself after college. need advice from smart people."

xsccy,1,2012-08-06,[31/m] My wife [31/f] appears to be falling out of love with me while away on internship.  Thoughts?,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/xsccy/31m_my_wife_31f_appears_to_be_falling_out_of_love/,"I just got off the phone with my wife, I have no friends or family that I am comfortable talking to about this.  Hello internets!  My wife and I have been together for 12 years, married for 3.  She is out of town on a ten-week internship, and I felt okay about this (other than missing her terribly) because I felt that our relationship was particularly strong.

She's been gone about a month, and though the first few weeks we skyped and chatted and talked on the phone a lot, the last few weeks she's been more distant.  I've been hearing more and more about a guy who is interning at the same place as her, and I know they've been going out a lot.  I didn't worry too much at first, I liked that she had a friend and wasn't just alone in her apartment.  A few weeks ago we got into sort of an argument over money on skype, and she said she ""didn't like our relationship right now"".  That was a pretty big blow but I didn't push the subject.  I stewed about it until last night when, while in a moment of weakness recovering from food poisoning, I tried every means I could to get in touch with her, then sent her an email saying that I was feeling insecure about our relationship, and needed reassurance that we were going to be okay.

Today she finally called me, said that being away from me she has realized problems with our relationship, she's not sure if she wants to make it work, something--she's not sure what--is happening with the guy friend (although they apparently haven't slept together).  We talked for a few hours and I cried and cried and she apologized and apologized.  I feel like such an idiot for thinking things were okay, that our relationship was so strong.  The last few years we've been really busy, both of us in school... a few years ago we were all gung-ho to have a baby, but did not succeed in conceiving and ended up putting that on the back burner while we finished school.  The last year or so there has not been all that much sex, she has had a low libido and didn't really know why.  

I don't know what the hell to do other than just lay here and cry.  Like I said I don't have anyone to talk to.  I'm really not mad at her right now, just scared and hurt and sad... and feeling like an idiot.  I was trying to convince myself to eat now that my food poisoning (unrelated) is past, but now I feel like withering away to a husk instead.  

I have reservations to fly down there and meet her in three weeks.  I miss her so much but now I'm not sure if I want to go anymore.  I feel like if I do we might end up deciding to call it quits while I'm there.  She has asked me to think about what I need out of the relationship and what is not right for me in it, and we will discuss.  I am dedicated to making it work but I sort of feel like she is hoping that I will agree to part ways.  I'm terrified.  Thoughts?

tl;dr:  Wife is away on internship, has a new close male friend, is not sure about the future of the relationship.  I fear I am about to be left."
xsc85,2,2012-08-06,Take it as it comes,TheManInsideMe,GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/xsc85/take_it_as_it_comes/,"The thing I'm starting to learn about life is the more you try to plan for it, the more frustrated and dissatisfied you become. For all intents and purposes my life is a motivational story to most, which I like, but I'm not entirely sure I intended. I'm severely physically disabled but currently go to a top tier university and live on my own, no small feat for people like me. I was an angsty teen, hated my life, my disability, and most of all myself. I just wanted to be normal, plain, and anonymous, things I will never be. I almost flunked out of school after I started looking at college and seeing none of them could support me, or even really wanted to. Hell I wanted to kill myself a few times, just to spare myself the future I saw, living at home forever, no friends, no relationships, redoing high school but worse. Then I visited the school I'm at now and everything changed, I turned it all around and somehow got in. 

Now I'm a senior and looking at grad schools, with two jobs and an internship ahead of me. It's pretty cool, just by living my life the way I want to live it and being generally ok with myself, things sort of just work out. I used to think life was all about success and failure and winning and losing, in some sense it is, but there's an idea that outweighs those: opportunity. I seem really laid back but I'm not, my eyes are peeled all the time for the chance to get something I want, big or small. Sometimes, you make your own opportunity doing no more than thinking, ""Wouldn't it be cool if..."", then doing something small to make it happen, and if it doesn't work no biggie, it was a small idea anyway. Sometimes though, those little ideas lead you down roads to big events, you just have to recognize them. One thing I try not to do though, is get lost in what I don't have, haven't done, or can't do. Those thoughts will eat your soul and leave you a shell of who you want to be. I've seen people like me who get so discouraged by the frustrations of life with a disability that they sink into bitterness and despair, never even trying to get out because they see no way out. There is always a way out, I'm living proof of that, it's just a matter of do you have the patience and fortitude to find it, then do it. It might not be the first thing you try, hell I'm willing to bet the first try is an unmitigated disaster, but even then is an opportunity to try again with a new approach, or even to decide maybe your time is best spent elsewhere, both good options. 

If you love yourself, and you love what you do, the happiness you crave is there the whole time, the rest is what you choose to do with it. 

tl;dr Keep your eyes and options open and life has a funny way of showing you the way, even if the road isn't quite what you expected. "

Our desks were in the same room with several other interns, and after a couple weeks we were obviously really into each other.  We talked all day every day at work and spent as much time as possible on the weekends playing golf or seeing movies or whatever.  The past month we have been unofficially dating, and we both knew it might have been a little soon to be dating.  Well she started getting serious about wanting to be official, but she was about to be going back to a different school.  I had dinner at her house Saturday night, and everything went great with her parents.  That night I brought up dating, and she said she wanted to wait a few weeks to make sure our long distance would not be a problem (2 schools in the same state about an hour apart).  That was fine, and she was still really excited about that time passing so we could finally date.  Well she woke up Sunday and told me she didn't think a relationship was a good idea.  Just like that, and offered no explanation other than she had too much on her plate to have a relationship.  Now she is back at school and won't even talk to me.

What happened?  Could it be her parents didn't really like me?  I figured it was honestly just the long distance, but she had been the one insisting that distance would not be a problem at all.  I'm so lost and sort of in shock that such a seemingly good thing ended in such an abrupt manner.

TL;DR   Girl from work dumped me after spending the summer happily together and anticipating visiting each other during weekends because of distance."
xrxmm,9,2012-08-06,A little help with a salary question?,[deleted],Design,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/xrxmm/a_little_help_with_a_salary_question/,"I'm not sure if I'm posting in the right place, so MODs, please move this if necessary.

I've found myself in a rather unique situation, and I was wondering if anyone could give me some input from their own experiences.

In 2004 I worked for a very well-known company as an intern doing web design, graphic design, content production, etc.-- essentially running their website and creating all the content for it as well. This was while I was going to school for journalism, and although things in the journalism field never worked out for me I continued to pick up web skills on my own as I designed and implemented new websites for various clients over the years.

Fast forward to 2009. Freelancing didn't work out as a career for me, nor did journalism. I decided to hook up with a company my father worked for (a major US fashion retailer who shall remain nameless) to make ends meet. My first job there was working on the phones as a call center associate. Over time, I was promoted from the entry-level position to a senior, then a lead, then a trainer.

A couple of months ago, a position opened up for what's called a ""Learning Design Administrator."" The job essentially entails, among other things, maintaining the company's online internal procedural manuals (terrible design that was done on a shoestring budget using Frontpage and nothing else back in the late 90's).

When, I realized how outdated and under-powered these procedural manuals were. Shortly after I started working for the company, I began working on my own solution to a lot of the issues presented by the site. About two and a half years ago, I presented the idea to my supervisor. She loved it, and my team at work started to use a version of it before IT shut us down because we didn't have their input.

The idea would have died there, had I just let it go. I didn't. I continued to use the solution I had created for my own purposes (one of the reasons why I was constantly promoted was my efficiency).

I became very much an expert in our systems, and one day about a year and a half ago, out of the blue, our VP sat with me to learn our fraud prevention system in preparation for a meeting with our vendors. I showed her the solution that I had created and she was shocked.

""Why aren't we doing this?"" she asked.

I told her about what happened when I tried to present the idea. She understood, but from then on she's always seen me as something of a genius and calls on me for tech-based ideas to problem solve current issues.

Fast forward again to today. When I was promoted to Learning Design Administrator, I was finally in a position where I worked with technology and once again able to pitch the idea, this time with some credibility and the ear of the right people in the company to get the attention I needed.

My boss got the go-ahead from her VP to write a business case justify funding for the project. What's more, they want me to build and maintain this project for use within my division, with possible expansion to the entire company down the road (I work in a support division encompassing about 1,200 employees). I may be able to hire someone to work with me on the project, so I may have some managerial duties as well.

Essentially the project involves building a newer, updated version of our procedural manuals (currently on a very fragmented website with about 700 individual pages) with social media functionality and a web forum to boot. The great part of this all is that I will save the company literally millions of dollars in lost productivity and provide immeasurable improvements in issue tracking, training, team building and associate feedback. This will also pioneer the concept of social networking among employees working in our industry. It turns out that all those years of teaching myself coding are finally paying off, and they want me to lead the project.

In other words, it's going to be a huge win for our company, and I couldn't be more honored to be leading the way.

So here's the bad news: I have absolutely no idea what to ask for salary. None. Apart from my freelance work (which was never very steady and never for major websites) and my internship (which paid $1,000/month before taxes) I have never had a true, full-time job in this field. I'm not exactly sure what category this job would fall into, but my research says about $70,000/year seems to be a fair salary for the type of work I'd be doing.

My question, then, are these-- what would you consider a fair salary for this type of job? Has anyone else here been in a similar situation and can give me suggestions on salary negotiations? What types of jobs should I bring up as comparable to the work I'm doing to support my salary requests?

TL;DR Got promoted through the ranks at my company. Made a design that will save us millions. I have no idea what to ask as salary.

2. Do most apartments have decent speed or is it a crappy shared router that will kill my connection?

From Jan-April I successfully went 90 days sober after good planning and commitment. In May I relapsed, and have been relapsing harder and harder up until now. 

This summer I threw away everything I struggled for during those 90 days. I attended Marijuana Anonymous, Meditated almost daily, Exercised consistently, Ate well, started seeing a therapist, went back to school, got an internship at a big company, started working on my social skills, was fulfilling court required classes, started picking up girls, meeting new people, all while getting over an EX and learning to manage a very destructive anger problem.

I jumped off the mountain I climbed just to fly rolling paper planes over cough syrup lakes, and drown in a stream of porn videos that ejaculated me back to my lonely bedroom. I blacked out the windows and opened a liquid-crystal's view into an endless illuminated world. Reality was just a dream as I rolled up my goals, inhaled pleasure, exhaled ambition, and ashed out any remaining sense of purpose. Wisdom texted me but I didn't feel like responding. 

I pulled out my lighter and sparked an idea that would burn away my self-built prison, and allow me to rise from the ashes. 

The paths of my mind are very worn and it will be painful to change them. Not only from smoking, but also a heavy gaming/porn/anger lifestyle as well. All of the triggers, emotional stuff, memories, anger, anxiety, depression, dullness, make this rough. It's like reprogramming myself to think differently, and that doesn't happen easy.

I need to wake up though and attend to my real dreams. I'm 24 but I've lost some very important years to this lifestyle, and I just keep making things worse. If anyone has tips for making the detox phase calmer that'd be cool. Looking forward to this! Cant be a lazy fuck anymore!

xulrs,7,2012-08-07,For Those Looking for Advice - Hopefully This Helps!,bookfoxx1987,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/xulrs/for_those_looking_for_advice_hopefully_this_helps/,"I wrote a blog recently about self acceptance inspired in part by the many people I see posting on here looking for advice as to how to feel more confident about their looks and with themselves. I'm still new to reddit so I'm not exactly sure what the rules are when it comes to posting blogs so I'm essentially copying and pasting what I wrote there here. I hope this helps someone out there.

1) Remember your strengths. Its easy to find faults in ourselves. I can think of quite a few without even beginning to critique my actual body. The best way to start accepting yourself and realize how amazing you are is to remember the positive. Its an age-old trick, I don't pretend to have ""discovered"" this magically on my own, but it doesn't change it from being true - if you want to feel better about yourself, you really do have to focus less on your weakness and more on your strengths.
My strengths include that I'm good listener, I am emphatic to my fellow human beings, I can make pretty amazing sloopy joes (not with manwich either! the real kind from scratch!), my friends seem to find me witty a good portion of the time, and I have gorgeous eyes.

2) Remember compliments. I was told recently that I have great legs. This is something I have never believed. Even now I still can't help but be critical of them.  I find them too wobbly, thick and hate the way my inner thighs rub together a bit. Today and yesterday though I walked around wearing shorts, showing off a lot of leg. Why? Because that compliment made me feel more confident about showing them off. Remembering those kind and sincere words helped me not to feel self-conscious. You can't control the compliments you receive, but you can control their impact on you. When you are complimented on anything, hold on to it. Don't just shrug it off or assume they're just saying it to be nice. They're saying it because its true!

3) Its really hard for people to push out of their comfort zone. They like the established order of things and don't like to break out of that mold. Here's the thing that I've noticed though - when you break out of your mold and do something outside of that zone, its a lot easier to feel at ease with yourself. It may sound like a contradiction, but its not. Trust me. Take me for example. Recently, to get out of my comfort zone, I bought a two piece bathing suit. I hadn't had one since middle school so buying one was a huge deal. Its bright purple too, a far cry from my typical black and white palate. Now that I've worn it a few times, I feel a bit more at ease with my body and self because A) I crossed a line and lived to tell the tale. Nothing horrible happened and I know now that taking a risk like that again will most likely turn out okay. B) A part of self-acceptance is knowing your boundaries. You can't know them unless you really test them. Had, after buying said two piece, I discovered I was really not okay with it and took it back, that would be okay too. I would just be establishing where my limit was and there's nothing wrong with that. Its kind of like trying new foods - if you don't like them, that's fine. Just try them first! C) There's something about breaking out of your comfort zone that seems to make an impression on people. Even if you decided you're never going to do it again, you're still going to impress someone with the fact that you tried. I've gotten more compliments (see item 1) after breaking out of my comfort zone, gotten more notice. That makes me feel good about myself and therefore gives me more confidence. Huzzah!

4) Have orgasms. Whether with another person or with yourself, orgasms do wonders. Not only are there all kinds of medical goodies about orgasms, but - and this is the most important thing - they feel great. After an orgasm, I feel like a fucking sex goddess (even if it was just a solo session with my rabbit). I feel sleek, sexy, and beautiful. I feel at ease with my body and have no problem with the fact that another person (in such a case) has just seen me at one of my most intimate and vulnerable moments. Orgasms are also great for relieving any stress you have. A sub category of this, if you're comfortable with it, is to give someone else orgasms, but that doesn't necessarily work for everyone. I just know for myself that getting another person off, having that ""power"" over their pleasure, really makes me feel...well, A) powerful and B) sexy as all hell.

5) Force yourself to feel sexy. Well, don't FORCE yourself, but do remind yourself that you are a sexy human being, that there is something (A LOT of somethings) that makes other people attracted to you, and that you're your own sexual god/godess. There's a couple of ways to establish this. One of my favorite ways to remind myself how awesome I am is to listen to some good music. I have one playlist on youtube that's called my ""Sexy"" playlist. Just full of songs - everything from NIN's Closer to Rebel Yell by Billy Idol to I Like It by Foxy Shazam - that make me feel awesome and put me in a good mood no matter what. Also, wear things that you feel comfortable in, that when you wear you get that little ""awww yeah"" feeling in your brain. Wear a dress or a nerdy shirt or some hot heels. Whatever makes you happy. For myself, something that always makes me feel like I look sexy and powerful is a good wife beater. I used to only wear them as pjs, but I've gotten into the habit of wearing them in the real world. Their super comfy and make my boobs look awesome!

6) Spend time with your less desirable traits. A friend of mine once posted this thing about taking the time the next time your naked in front of mirror to really look at the parts of the body you're unhappy with. To run your hand over it that birthmark you hate or that extra bit of fat on your hip and get to ""know it."" I force myself to do this almost every time I take a shower. Going along with that, take pride in your birthmarks, moles, freckles, scretchmarks and scars. They are not defects - they are markers of your awesomeness! I have 4 to 5 birthmarks - two on my right arm near my elbow, one under my left breast, another on my left foot, and (possibly?) one on my back (my mom says she saw one yesterday that I somehow I had never noticed). I also have several million freckles and an appendectomy scar. Last, but not least, I have a mole on my right shoulder. All of these make me ME and I love them. I take pride in them, in fact, mostly by making favorites (the one on my foot has always looked the coolest to me although the one under my breast is kinda adorable).

7) Take pictures of yourself! Lots of them! You know how sometimes you see a camera coming and instantly ready yourself for a sprint? Well...stop it! Instead of running away, run towards! Strike a poise and smile. If you find yourself bored without much to do, pull out your camera and have an impromptu photo shoot. I did this yesterday and had a blast. Granted I may have taken a few *cough* more adult pictures, but it was still fun and gave me a nice little confident boost. Plus, it was me pushing outside of my comfort zone a little (though I am getting better, taking pictures of myself of THAT nature still freaks me out a little) thus meeting requirement 3.

8)  Do something healthy. Eat a salad for lunch instead of eating a burger. Go for a run. Walk to and from work instead of driving. You don't have to commit to these things all the time, but doing so on occasion will give yourself a little boost. I recently have cut heavily back on my soda intake and have been slowly getting in the habit of running. I also have been trying to eat healthier, snacking on apples and wheat thins instead of Doritos. Even if I'm not the skinniest bitch on the planet, knowing that I am making some smarter, healthier decisions makes me feel better about myself. Its even caused me to lose some weight, an added plus! Assuming my money situation gets better any time soon, I'd love to join some kind of dancing class. I hear there's a zumba one near monument square and I've walked by the ballroom dance studio a few times on my way to my internship. 

9) And last but not least, when you do find it hard to have confidence, fake it. Seriously. It sounds stupid but it works. I once heard this little factoid that if you smile, even when you don't feel happy, the brain interprets the data from your face in a ""oh hey! My face is doing that smiling thing! I guess things are good right now"" way and thus tricks it into being happier. I have a theory that confidence works the same way.

I, once very shy and unsure about how anyone could be attractive to me - this in part being to my fiance cheating on me after we had been together for three years, am now in talks with a professional to do artistic nude photos. If I can do it, so can you (America)!"
xulhd,4,2012-08-07,"[FR] Ice Cream ""date"" with a co-worker, crashed and burned. Did I fail a shit test, or am I reading too deeply into it?",[deleted],seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/xulhd/fr_ice_cream_date_with_a_coworker_crashed_and/,"Hey seddit. Like many others, I'm completely new to this (20 year old virgin, never had a relationship, etc.), but after deciding to stop being a depressed fat fuck, reading up the material, going to the gym, starting up some awesome hobbies, getting my confidence back, and developing that all too important ""inner game,"" I had the opportunity to go on a date with a co-worker.

Now, since I've never had any real interaction with women outside of school projects, I made quite a few mistakes. I'd really like anyone's thoughts and advice on how I should have better handled the date.

So, one of my friends at the place I'm working this summer work told me that the new cute intern likes me, and I should definitely make a move soon. About a week ago I asked her if she wanted to get ice cream after work. She said that she was really busy that week, but she promised that she would be free this week. Normally I would have just given up, but since she kept saying that she *will* be free, instead of just rejecting me, I thought I still had a shot (was that a mistake?)

So finally, today, I decided to give it one more go and told her ""Hey, I'll be done with work early today. Why don't we meet up after?"" and she agreed. Probably nothing at all for the veterans here, but for a newbie like me, I felt as if I had just climbed Everest while performing heart surgery.

I went over to her once I was finished with work and saw that she was about finished, so I smiled and tapped her on the shoulder and said ""Let's go!"" and we walked downstairs together.

I've read here that kino is absolutely crucial, so I casually brushed up against her as we were walking, but honestly it came off more as awkward than seductive (what's the best kino I could have done here?). I told her that there's an awesome gelato place at the nearby mall, and we should try it.

Once we got to the parking lot of my work, she said ""okay I'll drive over to the mall and meet you there,"" and started walking away. I guess I should have taken her to the mall in my car, since we could have talked along the way, but I was already nervous as fuck so I just said ""sounds good, call me once you get there"" and drove off, cursing myself one I got into the car. 

As expected, this ""two car"" idea was about as successful as my dating life (i.e. not at all), so for 10 minutes we played phone tag after I find parking and she doesn't. We finally get to the gelato place, get our ice cream, and sit down at a table.

Again, I read here that it's best to sit 90 degrees away from someone instead of right across, but I thought it would be too awkward to drag a chair next to her, so I sat across (probably another mistake).

Here's where I'm confused. I thought I had made quite a few mistakes already, so I decided to just say ""screw it,"" and do whatever came naturally, instead of trying to actively seduce her. As a result, I didn't try to steer the conversation to sexual stuff (since I'm not at all used to that), and instead just said whatever was on my mind. We ended talking quite a bit about our hobbies (turns out, we're both really passionate about piano and music), about travelling, about our siblings (we both are really close to our little sisters), about school and college (we're both pretty nerdy, so this was not as dry a conversation as it might seem), etc.

But throughout this conversation, I got a torrential downpour of IOIs. Whenever there was a pause in the conversation, she would reinitiate. She would giggle at all of my jokes - in fact, since I had already resolved to just enjoy myself instead of trying to attract her, I started saying lamer and lamer puns just to see what her limits were. Yet even with:

""what is the difference between a well dressed man on a bicycle, and a poorly dressed man on a unicycle"" 

""I don't know, what?""

""attire (a tire)!""

she still giggled as if I was Dave Chappelle's lovechild with George Carlin. I then decided to try changing my posture, to see if she would mirror me, and she did. It was almost like a dance - I would lean forward, she would lean forward, I would put one arm on the table, she would put one arm on the table, I would scratch my face, she would scratch her face etc. 

She played with her hair, licked her lips, held eye contact with me, praised me, played with her necklace, touched my hand, pretty much everything on the list of IOIs.

Then, out of nowhere, she mentions that she has a boyfriend. Now, I know that this is a common shit test, so I thought that she was just lying about it, but she started talking about how she was having a really tough time last semester and he was the only guy that really stood by her and helped her through it. She mentioned how she got really stressed with school and how this guy, even though they went to different colleges, would drive up to her college to see if she's okay, and they would skype all the time etc. I don't think she was just making it up, since she went quite a bit into detail and didn't really seem to be lying.


This really fucked up my game. First, I didn't want to go and ruin this apparently happy relationship. The guy seemed like a stand up caring guy, and I didn't want him to have to be the collateral damage of my incredible seductive charm. Second, she seemed really fucking needy (expecting this guy to drive a couple hours over to her college every week, spending hours chatting with her to make her feel better, not hang out with his friends for her sake etc.), and I wasn't looking for anything serious since I only have about a month left at this job before I head back to college.

So for the rest of the time, I just sort of sat back and let her talk on. I had decided not to push for anything more with her, so I focused instead on enjoying my quite delicious ice cream. I at least got a lot of conversational practice - I used to be terrible at talking to people since I would spend my time trying to think of what to say next, but this time around, I figured out the perfect way to ask the right open ended questions to have her do most of the talking. After a while, she got a text from her aunt saying that she needed help with something, so she told me that she'd have to leave in about half an hour. I had finished my ice cream, so I told her ""I actually was planning on heading out now, so that should be fine.""

I got up, she said ""aww, okay I guess I'll go too. I had a really fun time talking with you today! We should have done this sooner!"" I don't know whether or not she went in for a hug (I really had stopped paying attention at this point), but I just smiled and said ""yup, it was fun. See you at work tomorrow"" and left. 

Anyway, I'm still proud of myself that I actually asked a girl on (what I thought was) a date, and that I managed to have a fun conversation with her. But I know that I made quite a few massive mistakes here. I really don't know what to make of the sudden revelation that she had a boyfriend, though. Any advice/comments?"
xtv3x,56,2012-08-07,Marketing on Reddit 101,iaman00b,marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/xtv3x/marketing_on_reddit_101/,"Having been on Reddit fairly regularly for close to a year, I've started seeing some patterns in the types of posts which people like to see, and of course started thinking about how one might go about advertising to this psychographic. I thought we might start a discussion which profiles the average Redditor, in a snapshot. The average Redditor will...

Upvote:

- women with a cute face or big breasts, or both
- touching stories with an unlikely beginning but a happy ending
- women holding animals (the rarer, the better)
- most things depicting Obama in a positive way
- physically visible changes due to effort (i.e. fat loss)
- most things related to bacon
- posts exposing companies in bad practices
- old school video games or indie video games
- popular items/icons re-created or depicted by a Redditor
- socially 


I don't mean to over-trivialize it, but I don't follow every popular subreddit, so I may be missing a bunch of stuff, which I hope you might fill in.

The three best subreddits in which to advertise seem to be /pics, /gaming and /funny. So, what are some of the best ways to advertise on Reddit without getting caught (like Chobani was the other day)? 

Rule #1: Do not buy an account, no matter how tempting. Cutting this corner without integrating and understanding the community first, can be a detriment and may backfire in an unpleasant way [Thanks to Zazie_Lavender for pointing this out]

Rule #2: Have an account for close to a year minimum

Rule #3: Post regularly about other topics not related to your product, a competitor's product (basically let an intern spend a couple of hours on Reddit per day, interacting and doing some research)

Rule #4: Don't be obvious

Rule #5: Be honest

Rule #6: Attempt to create a forum, open for discussion [suggeested by wtstephens in the comments]

My thoughts on rule #3 are:

- product placement: create a post not centered around the product but rather one where the product is in the clearly visible peripheral -- possibly with a positive connotation attached
- competitive advantage: create a post depicting a competitor in a negative way, and provide a solution with your company/product (and maybe casually mention a few much weaker competitors just to make it even less obvious).
- self improvement: create a post stating that your company's product has changed your life in some way, the bigger (albeit also the more believable) the better!
- self deprecating (may be a bit risky depending on how your company/product is perceived at this point in time): take a fake stand against your own product and shoot down some minor/insignificant issues with it while making sure your logo is prominently displayed and indicating clearly where this product may be purchased
- experience: create a post talking about, or showing, a great experience you had with a company/product
- nostalgia: create a post about how you used to really enjoy using your company's product several years ago, and how fondly you recall those times
- emotional: create a post tugging at emotional strings (such as a wedding) with your product/company being clearly displayed
- controversy: is your product causing controversy lately? Stir things up by facilitating discussion as a current employee/customer taking either a positive or negative (playing devil's advocate or lightly trolling can be a good way to engage people in discussion) position
- an odd occurrence: set up an event which features your product in an odd, unlikely or unforeseen circumstance and post about it
- informational/professional opinion posts: whether made officially (as a company or an agent of the company) or discretely, professional input is a great way to get people's attention [suggested by wtstephens in the comments]

Any other ideas of which you can think?

Some major companies which I suspect are already advertising on Reddit, in a subtle and sometimes not very subtle way:

- WD-40
- Valve
- Oreos
- Accutane
- Facebook (?)
- Microsoft
- Nutella
- Chobani
- EA (?)
- Warner Bros.

That's about it. Would love to hear your thoughts/critique/input!

Edit: Forgot to mention there's a subreddit which I follow -- /r/HailCorporate -- which keeps track of obvious marketing blunders on Reddit. Some of the stuff they find is fairly subtle and sometimes hilarious. There are some good, if not brutal, lessons to learn there. [I figured this would happen before long.](http://www.reddit.com/r/HailCorporate/comments/xxrmk/iaman00b_discusses_marketing_on_reddit_in/) As long as we're being transparent about what's going on, I think everyone benefits.

Edit v2: [here's a post on the front page right now](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/xtoxc/wife_parked_next_to_a_yaris_same_color_as_hers/) which follows a similar pattern (going to add it to the list). Is it a clever ad (for Toyota Yaris or the dealership) or just a ""crazy coincidence""?"

xtrzb,1,2012-08-07,Planning a one-week trip to Ireland and september and would like some help,[deleted],irishtourism,https://www.reddit.com/r/irishtourism/comments/xtrzb/planning_a_oneweek_trip_to_ireland_and_september/,"Hello everyone,

I've got an unplanned month of vacation in September and just finished a pretty well-payed internship. I've never been out of North America and was planning to spend a week in Ireland (most of my family is from there). I've read quite a lot about the country (both on here and on wikitravel) and I'd still like some help planning the whole thing from people who've either travelled to the country or who live in it.

I'll be travelling on my own, without a car (I'm an accident-waiting-to-happen on roads I know, I don't want to see me on unknown roads :P) and trying to stay in either hostels or B&amp;B (money isn't really a problem, but since I'll be on my own I'd like some company).

The main things I'd like to see/do:

* Spend 2 or 3 days in Galway to see the Cliffs of Moher and the Aran Islands (http://www.cliffs-of-moher-cruises.com/ any other cruses/tours?)

* Catch a tour of the Ring of Kerry (I'd need to know some interesting tours

* Visit Glendalough 

* Spend the last day/few days in Dublin (I'd like to do the Historical Walking Tour and the Literary Pub Crawl).

So now, what I really need to know, is this too ambitious for a 7-day trip? And how would I manage to get from one place to the other without having to get back to Dublin between each place.

I think this is a good start, I'll continue to do some reading and I'll try to post any questions I have concerning specific hostels and tours as I find them.

Thanks,"

This school is very strong in architecture/engineering, so it is hard to find ways to get involved on campus as a psychology student.  I am an online counseling and suicide intervention specialist (basically, I volunteer for an online crisis hotline - all instant message based) and I had an internship with a non-profit organization that works with individuals with depression, addiction, self-injury, and suicide.  I'm also the Vice President of Programming for my sorority.  With that position I schedule/plan all of the community service and philanthropy events that my sorority hosts and attends.

I have been looking into the applications for the schools I am considering, and I saw that many places require a letter of recommendation from someone with a MSW.  Unfortunately, I don't know anyone with an MSW.

So, with that, I have three questions.

1. What are some other things I can do to make my application stand out?  Are there any other volunteer opportunities I should look into?  I saw that CASA was mentioned a lot, but I don't think I will have the time to devote to a volunteer position such as that.  Are there any other places I should look into?

2. Would it be okay to reach out to local social work professionals to see if they could use a volunteer or let me shadow them for a while?  I'm not sure if that would be acceptable, but as of now I think it might be the only way to get to know someone with a MSW.  Do you guys have any other ideas?

3. Finally, will my degree or GPA (3.4) make a huge difference in whether or not I get in?  

If anyone could answer one or all of my questions, I would greatly appreciate it.

Edit: I already have a dell laptop that is abut 2.5 years old that's running perfectly fine. I just figured I'd buy a new laptop since I got some extra money from my internship over the summer. Also, I produce music, so I figured a macbook would be good for that."
xtbos,7,2012-08-07,Ex-Christian trying to leave church. I still work there and don't want drama.,throwthataway666,atheism,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/xtbos/exchristian_trying_to_leave_church_i_still_work/,"I was Saved at the age of 16, going to a church that my parents disapproved of. Continued to struggle a lot with depression durring this time. Surprisingly, couldn't pray myself happy. I started volunteering, and now officially am employed at the church. When I got the job was when my faith completely fell apart. Before the job, I was still depressed and having major issues. I could no longer ignore the fact that I am Transgender, and I was born this way.
The same week I was hired was the same week that I finally considered myself to be an ex-christian.
I'm still working here, and I have many friends/mentors/and people who REALLY care about me at the church. Not just the fake care, but actually love me to death.
I mentioned to some of the people I was close to that when my internship here was done, I was going to start going to another church closer to my future apartment-which I'm moving into by spring of 2013. I told them I wanted to get a job and advance my career.
I don't have any plan on going to another church. I just don't want everyone at the church to declare a state-of-emergency intervention or something.
When I told them I was planning on getting a job, in a higher up position, at a church somewhere else, everyone started arguing with me.

I'm having dinner with some of them within a few weeks to discuss why I want to go to a different church. I really do NOT want to tell them anything about my lack of faith/gender identity. I also can't quit this job- I really need the money until I find another job somewhere else.

What would be some solid excuses to go find another church? I've told them 1)our church doesn't have many people in my generation and I have no plan on getting involved with the ministries that already exist   2) I want to advance my career   3)It'll be closer to my soon-to-be home   4)I've never been to another church before and really want to explore my options

They still won't accept this. They say you should go to one church, and work at another.

I really don't want to completely destroy any relationships by leaving abruptly. I'm not sure what else to tell them. I feel like they're just trying to hold on to me because I'm a good resource to have(I have a lot of responsibilities), and, not to sound like I've got an ego but I'm one of the few people who make this church move forward...but I can't do it anymore.

If worst comes to worst, I'll simply inform them that I've already made my desision, I've prayed on it alot, and feel this is the direction gods pointing me towards. I'm getting out no matter what. I just want to do it carefully.

Do you guys have any ideas of how to go about this?


TL;DR Trying to leave church after internship ends. Can't come up with a good enough reason to tell everyone I'm ""finding another church."""
xt6m8,3,2012-08-07,I just really need to vent for a few minutes,Tywtly13,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/xt6m8/i_just_really_need_to_vent_for_a_few_minutes/,"I'm not seeking pity or really anything, I just really need to get some stuff off my chest and kinda....talk it out I guess. So here goes.

Last year, right before my high school graduation, my fiancee and I split up. I know it was dumb to be engaged that young and expect a high school relationship to work out. I know that now, but I didn't know it then. We split up because she cheated on me with a drug dealer. Awesome, right? And what makes it even cooler is, since I'm a Christian and so was she, we were waiting for sex until we were married. So she lost her virginity to a drug dealer after I had invested 4 years of my life to her. 

Soon after that, my dad and stepmom kinda kicked me out over a whole lot of nothing. So last Summer I pretty much lost everything I had really invested my life into. 

Then I started college. I just knew that this would be a better time, and I would fall on better luck soon. Wrong. After months of unemployment, I finally landed a job. It wasn't anything great, just a fast food fry cook, but within 3 weeks, I was laid off due to over-employment. Soon after that, I was able to find a position as an intern at a church that met on my campus. That was awesome because I didn't have to travel and I thoroughly enjoyed my work. I also found a job working as a plumber's assistant and making decent money doing it. Things were really looking up. But before too long I lost both of those jobs as well, and I'm not really sure why. It was in the same day, both of them just said not to come back in. 

Moving right along, after even more months of unemployment, I thought I was finally going to find another job. Everything seemed to be lining up just perfectly, and I honestly though my luck was changing. They told me a schedule they needed me for, put me through to 3 interviews with different managers, had me reschedule my classes for the coming semester to match their work for me, and told me I pretty much had the job. After stringing me along for about a month, last week they called and let me know they hired someone else. 

Fast forward to today. I found out the dean of students at my tiny Bible College has been lying to me and leading me on in regards to the scholarship I was told would be renewed. It turns out that I will no longer be receiving the financial aid that I solely rely on to pay for school. So now I will have no way to pay for school anymore, and I really just don't know what I'm going to do next. 

These are all the things on my mind right now. Thanks for reading I guess. "

But I tend to come here for a lot of pick me ups and motivation.  I also /rarely/ comment to help guys out.  But It's about time I share my success story.

Back in November I was in love with the most beautiful, nice, enchanting girl ever.  It was to the point where I was considering a pretty solid future with her.  Guess what?  That didn't happen.  Woke up one day, got dumped, and well... Guess you know what goes on after that.  I was pretty depressed for a good while.  You know what the worst part was?

We lived together.  And we had to for the whole next semester.

Through all this, I somehow got the spark.  I call it the ""batman"" spark.  Where I was so motivated for many reasons.  I made the decision to sculpt my life into what I always wanted to be.  I wanted to be super fit, get great grades, and have a solid road to my career.

Over the next semester (Spring 2012)  I got into FANTASTIC shape.  Lost 30 pounds, gained 6-7 pounds in muscle.  I passed my APFT through all of this with flying colors, and impressed all the NCOs in my military unit.  (Army National Guardsman here).  This SECURED my promotion, the only issue was this.

I had competition.

Through the school year I picked up great study habits, made a ton of brand new friends, stayed busy, involved, and really became the outspoken me I was before I was dumped.  

I got a phenomenal paid internship that will last until I graduate, which means I don't have to worry about having an income throughout the school year.  I work all year round.  I moved out on my own. I got my own place, with my own TV, with my own internet, etc etc.  I am living the life.

Fast forward a few months of success to this past weekend.  Drill weekend.

I was promoted to E/5 SGT.  

This is my success story.  

If you can take anything away take this.  Turning negatives into positives can be the most powerful thing in the world.  That's how I turned my life around.  

GO GET THEM WOLVES AND SHOW THEM HOW ITS DONE!

TL;DR:  Got Dumped, Thought I was going to lose everything, turned a negative into a positive, got super fit, got great grades, got an internship, secured a career path, got promoted in the army to SGT.

xsuqs,1,2012-08-06,Asked out two women at work. Was denied by both. Here is the situation and after thoughts. Why asking out a women isn't a big deal,NOFAP555,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/xsuqs/asked_out_two_women_at_work_was_denied_by_both/,"Myself: 20, relatively fit, intern at job for management position, going to senior year.

1st situation: This is a repeat of my previous post. At ------- working in pharmacy see woman I like working in my area. Have talked to her for a long time, before and she admired my physique asking if I worked out alot a couple of weeks back. I start making small talk get from the conversation that her car broke down. I ask if she needs a ride she says thanks but no thanks. I say hey have you seen any movies lately? She says that she wants to see the dark knight. I say if you ever want me to drive you I would like to go. She says uhhh and walks away and mumbles kinda running. Did I ask her out in a terrible manner? yes, I should have been more brave and aggressive, but I am just starting out so it's okay. So this is when all of the paranoia kicks in. WHo is she going to tell? Is she going to hate me know? I HAVE TO QUIT I can't bear too see her again!
I come in the next day, she smiles at me and says hi and we talk as if nothing happened. I realized that asking out a woman isn't that big of a deal. She is six years older than me, but hey if she said yes it could have led to lots of fun times, so its great I tried.

The second time I got denied- Their is a sexy asian girl that works on the sales floor. I was working on the sales floor also that day and I really wanted to talk to her. I am the manager of the sales floor that night so I told myself that it's now or never. I was tasked to work in a different section of the store while she was zoning in her own section toys. I kept putting off talking to her for later and later. I finally said to myself to hell with this job and everything I am going to go up and work along with her and talk to her, it won't be awkward. I go to her aisle and ask is it okay if I zone with her?She says yeah def. We zone and talk about smoking drinking traveling, partying, and work. I go to cover the electronics department because someone is taking a break andneeds someone to cover it. Over their I am sweating, it's 20 mins before she leaves how am I going to ask her out? Can I do this? I tell myself that it is absolutly normal to ask her out and in all she would be flattered. I hit myself, pump my chest, flex my muscles and walk over to her back straight full of confidence. I talk to her more, and ask when was the last time she went bowling or played pool. She says not for a while shes pretty bad at it. I say im probably worse, and laugh. I say the reason I was asking is I was wondering if you would be interested in going over to this bowling place I know. She said maybe, and kinda withdrew, symptoms of denial. I said it's my treat and she said maybe obviously not trying to hurt my feelings. But to HELL with maybe! I wanted a straight answer. I put my stuff down and walk up to her. I look her in the eye and say look, I to tell you the truth I was really asking you out on a date, this weekend and I would really like it if you come with me. She giggles and says she has a boyfriend. and says sorry. I say oh okay! and stammer a sorry I dk why I said sorry. She leaves, and I pat myself on the back for trying. I see her the next week, in these tight hot kahakis and sexy shirt. I say whats up and she smiles and says hey. We chat a little bit, and go our seperate ways in work. Now I can feel as if I completed something. I tried, I know the chances were slimmed and I tried for that what if. Unfortuanly it didn;t pan out, but for the next couple of weeks I don't have to wonder about everything, I can move on. Also it can lead to sexy times, by her taking her frustration of her boyfriend out on me in the bed. Now anything is possible and anyway the door is closed it may creep open once again.

So to everyone who is scared to ask a women out, don;t be. You will be denied alot. You will feel maybe hurt or offended. But I can tell you right now living in fear, regret, and paranoia is not living at all. Drop that book, drop that phone, drop that laptop. Pump your chest, straighten your back, breath in deep, flex your arms. Walk up to that woman and say  Hello..."

xsouj,1,2012-08-06,"need some words of encouragement; astrophysics undergrad, but I don't think I actually want to DO science...",[deleted],LadiesofScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/LadiesofScience/comments/xsouj/need_some_words_of_encouragement_astrophysics/,"This past year has brought a lot of changes to my life (good things mostly) and I am finding that I'm losing sight of the goals I had when I started college. I'm entering my junior year of undergrad. It's time for me to start hauling ass and think about applying for internships and getting a better feel for what jobs are out there etc etc. I feel lost and misguided. I go to a fairly well renowned university, and our physics department is really excellent, but the head of the department has never been helpful to me personally, when it comes to advice. He is hell bent on the idea that I need to be a high school physics teacher and I'm not really sure why. He also keeps our meetings very brief so it's just not helpful. I actually had the best experience/advice from my analytical physics TA last year so I'm going to keep chatting with him about my options but... I think I am realizing that I don't want to actually *be* an astrophysicist.  I won't have the money to go to grad school for a while, and while I know there are plenty of jobs in that field that don't require more than a BS, I'm still not finding any of it to be extremely appealing. I chose this major because I love it. I do. I love learning about space, physics, how it all works, why it works, etc. We know so much about earth and so little about everywhere else (comparatively speaking I suppose) and it's so fascinating to me. I'm good at math (I even like it!). It works out. No surprise, most of my friends are engineers and of course they all tell me ""just be an engineer!"" (because that's so easy, to just add an engineering degree onto an already difficult major). Let me preface this by stating this: I have absolutely zero interest in engineering. Never have. It's cool, but it's not for me. I have tried to like the idea and I just can't. But most of them have already done internships and co ops by now and have told me this ""wow, doing science can actually be REALLY boring sometimes"" ... however I already started to realize this. The idea of sitting in front of a computer and analyzing data for half the day drives me crazy. I can't do it. I can't. Even the idea of sitting at a desk most of the day is enough to steer me away. As you can imagine, that eliminates a lot of opportunities for me. I NEED to be moving, at least standing and walking or something. I don't even know what to do. I can't just drop my major and pick something else at this point. I don't want to--I want to keep learning about this, it's one of my favorite things to think about. But I can't see myself actually *being* an astrophysicist as a profession. And I don't know what to do with myself. Double major in something more ""practical"" ? I don't know. Maybe I don't even need to?? I know so many people who have various degrees, but their profession doesn't relate to their degrees at all. When I started college, I had lofty goals. I wanted to get a PhD at Princeton or MIT. I wanted to work for the Dept. of Defense or the Smithsonian or NASA (haha as if they even hire astrophys anymore). Not only does all of that seem out of reach, it just doesn't even appeal to me anymore.

I'm at a loss. I know this was a bit long and unguided, but I guess I am looking for some ladies who have been/are in similar situations. Any words of advice, encouragement, anything will be appreciated. If you have a story of your own, please share! I know I can't be the only one."
xwrw7,44,2012-08-08,I ama a 'stealth' Transexual.  AMA,giraffifer,casualiama,https://www.reddit.com/r/casualiama/comments/xwrw7/i_ama_a_stealth_transexual_ama/,"As the title states, in case you are wondering, though I do not typically use nor enjoy the term, 'stealth' is a term used in the transexual community to describe a transexual individual who goes unnoticed by society around them. 

I am not normally one for advocacy, its my personal opinion that everyone is going to make their own decisions and I'm not out to save the World, but a recent conversation at work enlightened me to the impact an AMA might bring out; especially in allowing honest, open questions. 

To set the stage here, I currently live within the state of Indianapolis and work for a mid sized marketing firm as an intern. We handle many things and my tasks are primarily filing budget forms and occasionally picking up odds and ends that are missed due to our execs traveling or taking 'working vacations.' While I typically enjoy my coworkers and I cannot say anyone does not work hard, I recently was part of a meeting that really unsettled me, leading to this AMA. 

My goal is to educate and put some assumptions to rest, and, perhaps even reinforce that some are actually correct. In our meeting, our new client has had candid conversations with our higher ups and while I was sitting in on a meeting today, as we dismissed out the door back to the main lobby area to see the client out, they were discussing the client's son, who's roommate had apparently been relocated and the client was laughing and said 'The boy apparently thinks hes a lady....crazy kids these days.... Im telling you its all this technology, its tearing the family unit apart.... Oh well, Mr. _____ and Ms. Giraffifer, you two enjoy your afternoon.' 

Typically this kinda thing does not bug me, but I often feel it odd how many people meet me, and say such things, not aware I am standing in front of them who have faced a similar ordeal. 

So Reddit, let's have at it, I'll be here for at least the next 2 hours answering as many ?s as I can. :)


EDIT
This was moved to placate the sensitive sensibilities who have seemed to believe I posted incorrectly. However, as I felt it was going in a good direction and saw even a few people I might be able to help, so I figured we'd try this again. AMA


EDIT 2: Had to go and sleep/work.  Just got back.  I'll be hanging around in case this has any steam.  Thought it'd get more of a 'bite' but I guess when this stuff is banished to casualiama, its not exactly shocking.  I'll be here a lil longer tho so if in the next 2-3 hrs, I'll respond almost immediately to any questions while I do some work on the home computer. :)"

I returned home, on time, in June and I'm so happy things turned out the way it did. 

I found out who my true friends are.
I got closer to my family than I could have ever asked for.
I finally have built up the courage to get a tattoo that represented the quote that got me through my internship.
I changed my hair and my style and have gotten so much more confidence in my decisions and myself than I could have ever asked for.

And I'm now able to enjoy the life I always knew I deserved and be happy doing it.

My most recent task involves creating a directory for a user on our server with their name, giving them modify permissions to the directory, and setting it as their home drive in active directory. The end goal is to create a script that will set up home drives by reading employee names from a .csv.

The below script provides me with most of the results I'm looking for. The only problem arises when I go into the GUI to look at the shared properties of the directory. The Network Path is listed but when I go into ""Advanced Sharing"" the ""Share this folder"" box is unchecked. The folder is not shared and it can not be accessed from other machines. Checking the box fixes the issue, obviously.

Is there an error in my code below? I'm relatively new to programming and I've been working out of PowerShell for less than a month at this point. I'm also self-taught, so I apologize for poor PowerShell formatting.

I am a long time reader, first time poster, but not quite sure where to turn with a question I have. So I chose Reddit.  I am M/20 and am currently in month 7 of a relationship with a girl I met at my university.  The catch here is that we have been apart all summer from school and I cannot get a read on how the relationship is going.  The big red flag, I think anyway, is that she is not returning any of my ""I Love You's"" anymore.  Am I making a big deal out of this?  

Here's some facts you might need:
We were apart this summer because she was teaching at a summer camp in a different state than me, and I had an internship so we have been unable to see each other.  School starts back up mid-August and I find myself wondering all the time what its going to be like.  

She is not a very emotional girl and doesn't like to talk about feelings etc. so I'm not sure if her lack of emotional communication is just her?  Or if it is a sign that something is wrong.  

Also:  We have been able to talk on the phone/skype now for almost 3 weeks and she has declined from wanting to do that.  We have talked on the phone just a couple of times.

It should also be noted that I really dislike texting,  but because it had been our only way to talk for a while, that is what we had done.  And, now that we both have service all the time, we text each other throughout the day.

So Reddit, girl's opinions especially welcome,  Am I being ridiculous and reading too far into this?  Should I be worried about her lack of communication? What should I do about it?  

PS- the rest of the relationship is seemingly fine, but this is my first relationship to take past 3 months.  So the most I can say is that I am pretty sure it's fine."
xw62e,19,2012-08-08,Having trouble talking to landlord about new dog. Advice?,saythatagain,dogs,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/xw62e/having_trouble_talking_to_landlord_about_new_dog/,"Hi all! My boyfriend and I are in a bit of a pickle and aren't sure how to proceed. Would appreciate any feedback y'all can offer. 

For background purposes - we have lived in the same house for over two years, always had a great relationship with our landlord. We have a fenced in yard and one dog (4 year old mutt) who is very well behaved. Our lease was a standard form lease that originally contained a ""No pets"" clause, but that was scratched out by our landlord and initialed by us (along with a few other minor adjustments) when we signed the lease. There is nothing limiting us to one dog and no other document mentions pets. 

After talking about it for several months, we decided we were ready to get another dog. We're both in graduate school and while our dog gets plenty of attention and exercise, I thought it would be nice to have two so that they could keep each other company while we're in class during the day. Because of our school schedule, we wanted to wait until our summer internships were over and before classes started to get the new pup. That way we would have a few days to get him acquainted to his new home/brother/crate, etc. before we were leaving him alone for any meaningful periods of time.

A few weeks ago I emailed my landlord to let him know of our decision to add a new dog and asked if he needed me to do anything like sign an amended lease. He responded in a one line email that he'd really like to keep it at one pet. I was pretty upset because I had been looking forward to a new dog for months and usually our landlord is very laid back and I know he has no problem with dogs and several of his other tenants on our street have multiple dogs.

So, my boyfriend gave him a call on the last full week of July to see if they could work something out. Landlord indicated that he wasn't firm on saying no new dogs, but he wanted to talk about it in person because he was concerned about a new dog being a nuisance to our new neighbors and wanted to make sure it was ok with them before we got one (we live in a duplex, so I don't think this is unreasonable). Fine by me. So, we come back from vacation on Aug. 1 and email the landlord to try to set up a time to meet. We're told it's his busiest week and it'll have to wait until this week, week of 8/6 - he made it sound like we could wrap it up in a ten minute meeting on Monday. We've introduced ourselves to the new neighbors and they are lovely people. We mentioned wanting a new dog and they had no problem with it, so again we tried to email the landlord this week and again he tried to put us off to next week. Now he is not answering his phone.

Here's the bad part: We jumped the gun a little. Once he indicated he was actually ok with us getting a new dog and that it was just something we all needed to talk about, we started looking at puppies at the pound. We picked one out, put in an application and will be able to pick him up tomorrow. If we miss our appointment tomorrow, his hold period is up and unless someone else put in an application for him, he could be put to sleep. Our animal control shelter is very high kill and even the cute puppies aren't safe when the pound is full. I might be able to delay the appointment by another day or two, but we are starting class next week and, as I mentioned above, would really prefer to make the transition as smooth as possible by having a few days to get the puppy acclimated before he is left alone while we are in classes. 

We really don't want to piss off our landlord, but he's being pretty cagey about this. He won't even tell us why we need to still sit down and talk about it, and his last email said it had nothing to do with the neighbors. Thoughts? Any landlords out there have some insight into what might be going on that a tenant wouldn't normally think of? 




**UPDATE:** Our landlord came through just in the nick of time. He stopped by the house this morning and explained that he was worried that having two dogs in a smaller home might be rough on the wood floors. It was as I had previously suspected - some neighbors down the street had 3 really terribly behaved dogs who ruined their apartment and that put a bad taste in his mouth. But, since we're good tenants, he's going to let us get the new dog in exchange for another pet deposit and amended lease. We picked the pup up  and he is happily exploring his new home. 

Thanks to all who posted! Up next: Taking bets on breed of the new puppy.

My ex GF and I broke up quite some time ago in January, she was leaving the country for an internship, so we decided to break up. Though because of the nature of the break up I still had considerable feelings for her, and still probably do though they are most definitely faded.

 Despite us breaking up we still talked exactly the same (using the same nick names and what not) though after a month and a half of this she tells me she doesn't see us dating ever again but wants to remain the best of friends (she then proceeds to encourage me to engage in one night stands and such, which made me fear that this is what she would simultaneously going to be looking for herself which ended up being true about a 30y/o sleezy mexican club promotor). I being unsure of my ability to separate my romantic feelings from her tell her I'd need time blah blah... 

So months go by and we seem to have the same relationship as always, and I confess to her that this isn't helping along with some dumb ass facebook lurking on my part that notified me I need to cut ties. She agrees that might be for the best. So I block her, I start to feel considerably better about the break up at this point and have been since until about a week ago I found out she traveled all the way to spain for a man she presumably knew before we had ever dated, this was fine to me but did hurt a tad bit. Then within the same week she confesses her love for a man she met in Belgium. (I am friends with some of her friends who unfortunately bring her more than I appreciate) Though I know it's been forever I guess I was okay knowing she had casually seen people but to know she has found someone presumably she loves who would 100% be a long distance relationship has brought back some of the pain, causing me to think that if she had loved me more she would have been willing to deal with the distance. 

I know its stupid thinking and what not, but now she comes back in less than 20 days, I go to a school of 600-700 people so seeing her will be unavoidable and the thought of being friends with her makes me sick to my stomach. Unfortunately I also hold a bit of a resentment towards her for leaving me and what not, I would very much so like to get rid this (which in the beginning was fuel for bettering myself but has since warped into an ugly thought process) especially cause the last thing I want to do is start any unnecessary feud.

So what the fuck do I do? Just tell her when she gets back that I don't really see where she fits into my life anymore, part of me wants to have some of the pain she has put me through but most of me knows that its just going to make me feel worse in the end. I want to tell her i don't want to be friends but when I say this I feel like people think I'm acting childish about the whole thing."

I'm in a huge spiritual rut in so many ways and I just don't feel God's presence anywhere right now. Here's what I'm dealing with.

Pornography addiction: I'm already active on noFap, I took several courses at settingcaptivesfree.com, and I have prayed and prayed and struggled and struggled. I was free for about a year about 3 years ago, but a stumble in my faith sent me right back in. I was a month clean not too long ago, but I've totally binged recently. I don't know how to get out.

School: I'm taking summer courses right now and I'm doing well, but the daily grind of school has made even fun subjects tedious. I have an internship too, which is related to my wildlife major, but even that is not fulfilling me because right now anything that I have to do becomes a chore.

Spiritual life: I'm going to a weekly Bible study, I go to church regularly (although I have missed the last 2 Sundays), and I try to read the Bible every day. Still, I don't feel God's presence. I have even wandered over to r/atheism a couple times and have noticed my doubts growing. 

I would welcome your prayers and any suggestions you guys have to give my walk with God fulfillment and life again. I just don't feel anything. I hate being numb like this. Thank you and God bless."

The program is as follows:

Upperbody, Monday + Thursday

--------------------------------------------------------

I also run every Wednesday morning for 25-30 minutes to maintain my running. I was told to cut back on running when i started this workout plan. right onto my diet

Diet

- I currently have stopped all takeaway besides on Wednesday when I treat myself to Subway, coffee and a snickers bar.

- For Dinner i have been having 
chicken breast
Frozen mixed veges
roast potatoes

I have been alternating steak and chicken basically. My diet has been pretty loose and I would love some advice. I currently weigh 90kg and I am 6 foot 4 so a skinny tall guy. I basically want to bulk up and get toned. I have noticed improvements in my strength already so that is awesome!. I just don't really know were to go from here though and am tossing up seeing the personal trainer again to revise my workout.

For the Police fitness i know i need to do 32 push ups and currently I can do 25ish. Besides the push up guides online is there anything anyone can recommend?

I know the information above may be lacking in detail so please ask away if you have any questions. Also i can post photos if that will help

Thanks /r/fitness

Me and my wife got married on 7/4/2003. For the most part we've had our ups and downs but since late last year it seems to me at least that things have gotten bad. She has started hanging out more and more with a friend who just lost her husband. I was understanding st first, but I really started feeling it was getting excessive. When I'm not home she is there, spending the night when I work midnights or even when I work late. In the morning when I leave for work she gets up and leaves and goes straight there. There was also one time when I left the house for work in the morning and she was in bed, I got 5 minutes down the road, realized I left my cell phone and went back to get it and she was gone to over there. That made me livid. 

I'm not blameless. I work long hours and I'm in grad school. I fo admit to being disconnected at times, working in the computer and such. A lot is for school work, but not always. I also suck at saving money. My weight is also a factor, making it hard for us to have kids. I am getting gastric bypass in 2 weeks to start fixing this. We have sex rarely anymore, and I'm sure my bring tired sll the time (I work 45 hours at work and 16 at an internship in two stressful fields) doesn't help. This other woman has two small children, and my wife adores them.

The kicker came over the last few weeks. She went on vacation with them for a week to the beach. I got infrequent calls from her. She came home Monday and I saw her some that night and a few hours yesterday. Again, my schedule sucks. I wanted her to come home an hour prior to church to see me before work again and she says no, she'll see me Thursday and Friday. I got mad, yelling that she spent all last week with her and hung up on her. We texted back and forth, her defending that I blew up for no reason, and me saying I don't even feel married anymore. 

I don't feel she is physically cheating on me, but emotionally I feel disconnected. I'm at a loss and unsure where to go from here. Help!"

Most of this has been seen before but it is illuminating to have it all condensed as it is here.  If only Obama had been half as forthcoming and where is the Democratic criticism of him?

This is worth passing around.

            His full Name is: Willard Mitt Romney

            He was Born: March 12, 1947 and is 65 years old.

            His Father: George W. Romney, former Governor of
            the State of Michigan

            He was raised in Bloomfield Hills , Michigan

            He is Married to Ann Romney since 1969;
            they five children.

            Education:
            B.A. from Brigham Young University ,
            J.D. and M.B.A. from Harvard University

            Religion:
            Mormon - The Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-Day Saints

            Working Background:
            After high school, he spent 30 months in France as a Mormon
            missionary.

            After going to both Harvard Business School and Harvard Law
            School simultaneously, he passed the Michigan bar exam, but
            never worked as an attorney.

            In 1984, he co-founded Bain Capital a private equity investment
            firm, one of the largest such firms in the United States .

            In 1994, he ran for Senator of Massachusetts
            and lost to Ted Kennedy.

            He was President and CEO of the 2002 Winter Olympic Games.

            In 2002, he was elected Governor of the State of Massachusetts
            where he eliminated a 1.5 billion deficit.

            Some Interesting Facts about Romney:

            Bain Capital, starting with one small office supply store in
            Massachusetts, turned it into Staples; now over 2,000 stores
            employing  90,000 people.

            Bain Capital also worked to perform the same kinds of business
            miracles again and again, with companies like Domino's, Sealy,
            Brookstone, Weather Channel, Burger King, Warner Music Group,
            Dollarama, Home Depot Supply, and many others.

            He was an unpaid volunteer campaign worker for his dad's
            gubernatorial campaign 1 year.

            He was an unpaid intern in his dad's governor's office for eight
            years.

            He was an unpaid bishop and stake president of his church for
            ten years.

            He was an unpaid President of the Salt Lake Olympic Committee
            for three years.

            He took no salary and was the unpaid Governor of Massachusetts
            for four years.

            He gave his entire inheritance from his father to charity.

            Mitt Romney is one of the wealthiest self-made men in our
            country but has given more back to its citizens in terms of money,
            service and time than most men.

            And in 2011 Mitt Romney gave over $4 million to charity, almost
            19% of his income....
            Just for comparison purposes, Obama gave 1%
            and
            Joe Biden gave $300 or .0013%.

            Mitt Romney is Trustworthy:

            He will show us his birth certificate

            He will show us his high school and college transcripts.

            He will show us his social security card.

            He will show us his law degree.

            He will show us his draft notice.

            He will show us his medical records.

            He will show us his income tax records.

            He will show us he has nothing to hide.

            Mitt Romney's background, experience and trustworthiness show
            him to be a great leader and an excellent citizen for President of the
            United States.

            You may think that Romney may not be the best representative the
            Republicans could have selected. At least I know what religion he is,
            and that he won't desecrate the flag, bow down to foreign powers, or
            practice fiscal irresponsibility. I know he has the ability to turn this
            financial debacle that the current regime has gotten us into.

            We won't like all the things necessary to recover from this debt,
            but someone with Romney's background can do it.

            He never was  a ""Community Organizer"", never took drugs or smoked
            pot, never got drunk, did not associate with communists or terrorists,
            nor did he attend a church whose pastor called for God to damn the U.S.

*Met criteria: ups&gt;4 and score&gt;3*"
xv4ke,1,2012-08-08,I think I cheated.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/xv4ke/i_think_i_cheated/,"
In a nutshell: I'm 19, female and have been dating a 21-year-old (call him Boyfriend) for almost 8 months. Last night I cuddled with a 21-year-old man (call him Colleague) whom I've grown close to as a friend over the past 3 months. I feel guilty about it and am concerned about the implications.

A little more detail (ok, a lot more detail):
I'll be the first to admit that I have issues. I was homeschooled growing up which contributed to a lot of shyness and social anxieties. I planned on living and dying alone, certainly never having a boyfriend.  

Three weeks after moving out to go to college I receive my first kiss. That seems to spark a change in me so that I was suddenly comfortable(ish) with the idea of dating. I date a guy for about 8 months who gradually grew tired of dealing with my clinginess, occasional hysteria, and lack of self-confidence. After he dumped me, I spend three months wallowing in self-pity and depression, during which time I grow close to Boyfriend. 

**tl;dr Boyfriend and I meet whilst I am reeling from a lifetime of social isolation and the shockwaves of being dumped**

Boyfriend is quite the unique gentleman, and is more affectionate and honest than anyone I know. He tells me that he loves me, and I reply that I want to be happy and I want him to be happy; how convenient would it be if we could make each other happy! I was honest in this statement, but tentative in my belief that we were right for each other.

So we enter into this relationship. Things progress fairly quickly, and before too long he tells me he wants to marry me, which freaks me out a fair bit. After further consideration, though, I decide that such an arrangement would be optimal. He treats me with more kindness, patience, and affection than I've seen anyone else treat anyone else. This is really great for me, but it has an unfortunate side effect:

My best efforts to figure myself out yield the understanding that I have low self-worth. One can imagine how seeing someone treat what you consider worthless with a large degree of respect and affection would make you question his intellect and sensory facilities, maybe even to the point of disdain. If you see someone coddling poop, you probably won't hold that someone in particularly high regard. (I'm the poop in this analogy.) I don't see what he sees in me, so my visceral reaction is to deem him crazy. Conversely, people who treat me poorly or objectify me are more sensible by this metric, and thus deserving of my affection. For this reason, I never felt the desperate and overwhelming emotional need for Boyfriend that I felt for the exes that spurned me.

tl;dr Boyfriend is very good to me; nevertheless, [assholes are better at making people care about them than gentlemen are.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV2lzgThAFk)

So I don't feel desperately in love with him. I'm pretty sure that's ok, though; fervid emotions may not necessarily be a part of a mature relationship, nor do I believe they are a sufficient component. We each contribute to the other's happiness and self-betterment, by the respective other's admission. I do think this is the healthiest relationship I've been a part of, and I think that spending my life with him would be more pleasant than spending it alone. 

Like I said, things progress quickly. I was brought up in a fairly religious family, which had me convinced for most of my life that sex was more or less unspeakably evil. Boyfriend deflowered me and therein convinced me otherwise. After 6 months, we decide to move in together. This strikes me as awfully hasty, but haste in and of itself doesn't constitute folly. Upon informing my parents of my plans, they invoke God's disapproval, I communicate my disbelief, tears are shed--but that's another whole story. Point is, Boyfriend has induced a pretty radical lifestyle change for me. Two years ago, I would've classified myself as ""forever alone"" without hesitation. Two years is a fairly short time to go from being convinced that I would never even be able to make a real friend to actually contemplating marrying somebody. 

This relationship has changed me in other ways; I'm no longer certain that the moral boundaries I grew up with are correct. Two years ago I would've had completely different answers to the questions like ""is it ok to have premarital sex"" and ""are gay people evil"" and ""is global warming a myth"". 

This rapid change is simultaneously exciting and unnerving. Exciting because I'm becoming an autonomous individual, making my own choices, directing my own future, choosing my own companions. The unnerving bit is the idea that I'm wrong: that I'm only doing what I'm doing because I'm young and naive and amenable. If this is the case, it's only a matter of time until I become like one of the depressed and jaded girls I read about in Christian magazines growing up--led astray by godless boys who claimed to love them. I've made the choice to try to figure out my own morality instead of adhering to what my parents set forth; if I'm wrong, the implications (hell, specifically) are pretty severe. So there's the unfortunate complication that due to residual religious paranoia, I'm not convinced that it is morally acceptable be with him.

**tl;dr Boyfriend is changing my life, and we plan to spend our lives together, which is an alarming but exciting prospect**

Anyway, I move a couple of states away for an internship at the beginning of the summer (I'll be moving back in a couple of weeks). Three other interns and I all live in an apartment together, and we grow close as friends, often staying up until the wee hours of the morning talking about life, science, high school, relationships, hopes, dreams, fears, etc. It's a fun environment, and we all joke around. Sometimes the joking borders on flirting. I tell myself it's no big deal, that I'm just growing more open and cavalier and confident as a person. Maybe this is the case; maybe not. 

On one such occasion (last night, to be specific), I was lying on the couch which Colleague was sitting on. It may be valuable for the reader to note that at this point I had been awake for 40 consecutive hours. We were having what we laughingly admitted to be a middle-school conversation: talking about hugs and kisses and ""peanut butter"" (which had previously been established as a euphemism for sex). Eventually we were both lying on the couch, spooning. That's it. Nothing particularly scandalous, but nothing particularly chaste. Our legs were intertwined a bit, and he massaged my shoulders a bit. I had missed cuddling with Boyfriend, and this was pleasant and comfortable and calming. But I was cuddling with someone who wasn't Boyfriend. The notion bounced around my sleep-deprived head. What would it be like to cheat? ""Fidelity,"" I said softly. ""What?"" asked Colleague? ""Fidelity. Sometimes I don't want to be fiddle."" (fiddle being the adjectival form of fidelity) Colleague laughed and raised his eyebrows jokingly. I laughed. We continued cuddling, then eventually went to our respective beds. 

**tl;dr I cuddled with a colleague and pondered the notion of cheating**

I woke up this morning feeling quite guilty. I googled ""is cuddling cheating"" in an attempt to either affirm my guilt or absolve myself. Remember, I've experienced quite the shift in moral framework, the result of which is a lack of certainty as to whether the guilt I feel is actual evidence of wrongdoing or simply a vestige of my religious upbringing. Anyway, the results of my google search do indeed condemn me by popular consensus. Well, fuck. My next move is googling ""I cheated"" for some insight as to how to apologize. I didn't find what I sought. Here's what I did find:
1. I deserve to be dumped.
* I didn't think I deserved him in the first place; now, I think it's clear that I don't.
2. My actions might indicate that I don't actually want to be in the relationship.
* As Johnny Depp apparently said, ""if you love two people at the same time, choose the second. Because if you really loved the first one, you wouldn't have fallen for the second."" I certainly didn't fall for any second person, but I cuddled with one (for the record, I have no romantic interest in Colleague).

What I want to believe is that what took place isn't significant, and is simply the result of fun among friends gone a bit too far. If this is the case, the proper course of action would be to simply use this as the impetus to become more guarded in my actions and be more deliberate in my efforts to remain faithful to Boyfriend. Conversely, what may in fact be the case is that I did what I did because I'm not sure I want to be with Boyfriend. I think I want to be with him. But I'm not convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt, nor do I expect to attain such conviction; to be honest I think it's a bit batty to have rock-solid confidence in anything in particular (I mean, that's what religious fervor takes the form of, and that's generally considered a bit batty around here from everything I can discern). At this point I don't know whether I should keep this to myself and do better, or tell him and ask for forgiveness while resigning myself to being dumped yet again (this would be the 5th time out of 5 relationships in 2 years).

That's it. I'll be surprised if anyone reads this far but if so, I'd appreciate any insight. And if Colleague reads this: don't feel bad, my guilt arises out of no fault of yours :P

**tl;dr I don't know: am I a ho, or no?**"
xv4cm,1,2012-08-08,Need some advice or insight about getting back in the game or even telling if someone is interested.,[deleted],dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/xv4cm/need_some_advice_or_insight_about_getting_back_in/,"** I'll go ahead and put the TL;DR here. 23f is there a way to get past all the games? Is there a way to tell if someone is interested in you? Am I doing something wrong? ** 

Sorry this probably going to long.... Also, sorry for formatting on my phone 

**Background** 23F recent college graduate with a job as a software developer. I've been single for the past 9 months and hadn't really thought about dating again until recently. The main reasons it really hasn't been on my mind until the past month are :
     * I was trying to finish up school and didn't want to deal with it
.    * i noticed that i was choosing the same type of guy and expecting 
.            a different result. 
.    * i didn't want to deal with the whole trying to get a job in the same
.             area mess. I wanted to be free to make my choice.


With all that said now after i find myself getting settled and adjusting to the real world. I find myself wondering how do i even go about this? By this i mean in the past I've never done any of the pursing or flirting. Which also i never knew anyone liked me until they asked me out. I would like to change this. 

Over the past two months i met a guy at work. He's in a different department and actually he's 21 and an intern. Which his internship is over at the end of the week. Anyways we only met because we both started the same day. Due to numerous run ins the hallway or him walking by cubicle we got to talking. Which we exchanged numbers and talk a good bit. Now even though his internship is over he will be going to college not even an hour away. So dating could be possible and im not looking for serious. Anyways, im pretty sure he's never going to ask me out. So can someone tell me where i went wrong or what the end game is? 

Ill try to sum our interactions and what led me to think he was possibly interested.  

Alright, so we halfway meet in the office lobby wating for our prospective boss to come and get us. He had a nice smile and wouldn't stop staring at me. So after the first week I'm thinking never going to see that guy again. (our office is huge there are still parts i haven't seen) right as i get done thinking this i see him walk by which like okay that just sheer dumb luck. As the next week continue he appears everyday around the same time. So by the end of the second week i decide to say something so i say hey we have a brief conversation. Then i don't see him for another week the next week i turn around and see him walk by and he sees me see him. So he stops and talks to me. The normal what am i doing and what was i listening too. Which i mention that i really needed to get Spotify downloaded outside of the work because the site was blocked but the port was open. So he leaves i go about my work. Two hours later i get a message from with a link to download Spotify. Which at the moment i shocked he paid attention to what said. Now I'll speed this up. So after that lead us talking for hours for 3-4 times a week. Sometimes he starts the conversation other times i do. We both give each other a ton of crap on different development views we both have. We share a lot of the same views with things in society, the types of people that annoy us, habbits,tv-shows. So we always seem to have something to talk about  The other day he was talking to me through our work instant messanger and said i would have talk to him later because i was going for a walk. It was during lunch and i hate being in that building all day. Plus we have a beautiful lake behind our building with a path. Well as i finish this he ask if he can come too. So we head off to the lake. Well the whole time he walking really close to me and the whole time we are laughing, joking around and finding more things in common.

So all of that lead me to believe that maybe he was interested.  Seeing that he leaves at the end of the week leads me to believe that he's never going to ask me out. We have been to lunch together but one of his friends was there. Which he didn't like it when his friend discovered we went to the same school and we started talking about. He immediately jumped in and changed the subject.    

**TL;DR Recap** 23f just trying to see what im missing? Want to date but can't seem to find someone that is also interested in her. Is there a way to tell? "

            His full Name is: Willard Mitt Romney

            He was Born: March 12, 1947 and is 65 years old.

            His Father: George W. Romney, former Governor of
            the State of Michigan

            He was raised in Bloomfield Hills , Michigan

            He is Married to Ann Romney since 1969;
            they five children.

            Education:
            B.A. from Brigham Young University ,
            J.D. and M.B.A. from Harvard University

            Religion:
            Mormon - The Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-Day Saints

            Working Background:
            After high school, he spent 30 months in France as a Mormon
            missionary.

            After going to both Harvard Business School and Harvard Law
            School simultaneously, he passed the Michigan bar exam, but
            never worked as an attorney.

            In 1984, he co-founded Bain Capital a private equity investment
            firm, one of the largest such firms in the United States .

            In 1994, he ran for Senator of Massachusetts
            and lost to Ted Kennedy.

            He was President and CEO of the 2002 Winter Olympic Games.

            In 2002, he was elected Governor of the State of Massachusetts
            where he eliminated a 1.5 billion deficit.

            Some Interesting Facts about Romney:

            Bain Capital, starting with one small office supply store in
            Massachusetts, turned it into Staples; now over 2,000 stores
            employing  90,000 people.

            Bain Capital also worked to perform the same kinds of business
            miracles again and again, with companies like Domino's, Sealy,
            Brookstone, Weather Channel, Burger King, Warner Music Group,
            Dollarama, Home Depot Supply, and many others.

            He was an unpaid volunteer campaign worker for his dad's
            gubernatorial campaign 1 year.

            He was an unpaid intern in his dad's governor's office for eight
            years.

            He was an unpaid bishop and stake president of his church for
            ten years.

            He was an unpaid President of the Salt Lake Olympic Committee
            for three years.

            He took no salary and was the unpaid Governor of Massachusetts
            for four years.

            He gave his entire inheritance from his father to charity.

            Mitt Romney is one of the wealthiest self-made men in our
            country but has given more back to its citizens in terms of money,
            service and time than most men.

            And in 2011 Mitt Romney gave over $4 million to charity, almost
            19% of his income....
            Just for comparison purposes, Obama gave 1%
            and
            Joe Biden gave $300 or .0013%.

            Mitt Romney is Trustworthy:

            He will show us his birth certificate

            He will show us his high school and college transcripts.

            He will show us his social security card.

            He will show us his law degree.

            He will show us his draft notice.

            He will show us his medical records.

            He will show us his income tax records.

            He will show us he has nothing to hide.

            Mitt Romney's background, experience and trustworthiness show
            him to be a great leader and an excellent citizen for President of the
            United States.

            You may think that Romney may not be the best representative the
            Republicans could have selected. At least I know what religion he is,
            and that he won't desecrate the flag, bow down to foreign powers, or
            practice fiscal irresponsibility. I know he has the ability to turn this
            financial debacle that the current regime has gotten us into.

            We won't like all the things necessary to recover from this debt,
            but someone with Romney's background can do it.

            He never was  a ""Community Organizer"", never took drugs or smoked
            pot, never got drunk, did not associate with communists or terrorists,
            nor did he attend a church whose pastor called for God to damn the U.S.

xuyqm,21,2012-08-07,My story : Can anyone help me with what to do next?,mysuckysituation,lostgeneration,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/xuyqm/my_story_can_anyone_help_me_with_what_to_do_next/,"I'm at a loss, hoping maybe the great internet hive-mind could offer some possible solutions. 

-**Pre-college**-

Did great in high school, excelled academically all around. Spent most of my free time drawing/crafting stuff. Graduated, time to go to college like any good academic student. 

Parents and college advisor steered me towards a private school, since I was very academically minded, they thought I'd do better with smaller classes and a challenging curriculum. Cost: $33,000 per year. 

-**College**-

""Time to pick a major! What do you like doing? What're your hobbies?"" ""Art"" ""You should do graphic design! It's really the only art that pays"" ""Okay"" I was 18, had no clue what I was doing, but my parents always had the mantra ""Do what you love and you'll never work a day in your life!"" and my college academic advisor had the same philosophy, so I majored in graphic design.

I loved college. I worked really hard. I loved the history, the philosophy, the math. I really loved the art electives, the printmaking, the sculpture, the bookmaking. Fun! Worst classes: graphic design. Bleh. I felt both overwhelmed and under-stimulated. I was never even good at it, despite trying so hard. I scraped by with B's and C's in these classes... my major GPA was about a 2.7, while my overall GPA was a 3.9. I should have noticed something wrong somewhere around my junior year, but I was young, I was having such a great time with my other classes that I pushed it aside.

Senior year, first semester: Internship. Hell. Awful. Hated every second of it. 
Senior year, second semester: Time to put together a portfolio. Nope. I didn't. I have never blown off a class so hard. I filled my time with some other bullshit-type classes (I took a seminar on cancer in the modern age, a sculpture class, and a class about ancient japanese culture. Loved them all so much!) Graduated with no portfolio, no job prospects, but a decent GPA. 

-**Post-college**-

Moved back in with parents. Told them I was working hard applying to jobs... really I had no clue what I was doing. I sent out a few applications but wasn't excited to do graphic design and had no portfolio so it was useless effort. 

Time to pay off student loans! Total debt after scholarships and what-not: $28,000. Ouch. The cost didn't seem so big until I had to start paying it off. Got a job at the local grocery store to pay the bills. Great job! I work in the kitchen. I have tons of fun making food everyday! But I feel like this is way below my capabilities, and they pay me $9.50 an hour. Over half of my paycheck goes to my student loans. The rest goes to my car loans and gas. 

-**Today**-

It's been over a year since I graduated. My parents are frustrated. We fight constantly. They want me out of their house, it's getting to the point where they might do it forcibly. I'm starting to lose interest in this job. It's showing. I'm late a lot, getting in more trouble for little things. 

I had a potential roommate - I would have been living in not-the-best part of town and would have needed a second job (starbucks? or another retail store at night?) and would have had to lower my student loan payments by a lot, and would have to go back to a ramen-and-rice diet, but I could have done it. Then she dropped out of the deal, and I had to look at my life...

Do I want this? To be a smart, young, educated and motivated individual scraping by working two jobs to afford a shared apartment in the ghetto? 

I need a change. I don't know what it is. I've tried applying to offices that would pay a bit better, even if I sort of dislike the work, I figured I could go to school at night for something better. But what? I was considering hair dressing, maybe nursing. Something more active where I wouldn't get as bored, and maybe I'd excel. Would that career fall through too? Do I want even more debt? Doesn't matter, the offices are all laying off, not hiring. 

I'm at a stalemate. I know you all are too. I saw a counsellor about this a few months ago, his advice was ""Suck it up and get back on the graphic design horse"" but it really isn't that easy, the design market is terrible and my skills aren't that good, and I have no work to show for my time in college except good GPA, but design firms don't give a shit about that. 

Reddit, what's a girl to do ;-; Any advise? I'm just totally lost. "
xuwst,2,2012-08-07,"My friend's girlfriend is taking advantage of me, what should I do?",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/xuwst/my_friends_girlfriend_is_taking_advantage_of_me/,"Well, I guess I'll start from the beginning.  One of my very close friends(M 23) (lets call him doug) started dating another friend of mine (F 20) (lets call her patty).  I've known doug for a while, but recently started being friends with patty.  Patty's life seemed tough, her mother was coo coo for cocoa puffs.  She confided a lot in me, and I believed her.  One day her mom kicked her out (for something dumb, but no need to that detail in here).  I offered my house to her.  She lived in my house for several months.  In that time I would have to drive her to school, to work, and to anywhere she basically wanted.  I didn't mind at first,  I felt bad for her. She came from a less fortunate family than myself.  After a few months, I noticed her stories started to sound strange to me.  A lot of things didn't add up.  Doug however, reassured me that everything was fine and that she wasn't lying.  I believed him.  ( I later found out that she did lie to me, about a lot of things.  However, I don't feel those details need to be shared.)

After a few months, she moved away to some internship thing (helps her pay for school).  Its a good drive away, but decent enough to make in one day.  While she was over there, she was to support herself financially.  My mother helped her and taught her about banking, credit, what should be a necessity and what should be held off on.  In the first two months of going out she did nothing but party.  She went to clubs, went out to dinner, and spent her money on useless things.


(On a side note, yet sort of part of the story,  Doug decided he wanted to break up with her.  He was upset about the immaturity issues as I was.  I never really talked to him about her, but if he came to me, I'd listen.  When he went to talk to her, I guess he decided instead of making himself look like the one who is upset and untrusting of her, he decided to say ""Oh, bvncmx thinks we should break up, she thinks you're a bad person, that you lie about a lot of things, and that you party too much.  As you can tell, that put a dent in our friendship (all around))

Now at this point, I know its not my business how one spends her money.  However, when it affects MY money, thats another story.  See, now when she stayed at my house, she needed a cell phone.  I decided to put her on my family plan.  The payments were to come out of my account as usual, she would just pay me a day or two in advanced before the money came out for the bill.  The first month she was late, I let it slide.  Then the second, third, and fourth month, she was also late and I had to remind her to pay me.  This time I didn't have enough money to cover her portion of the bill, and since she forgot to pay me, my over draft protection kicked in and charged me $10.  

Granted, Its only $10, but as a college student, I NEED those $10.

I wrote her the day the bill went through.  I said "" Patty,  I need the money in my account before the end of the day""  She responded with ""ok"". The day comes and goes.  The next morning, I see she still hasn't paid me.  (at this point I'm furious,  not one single month has she paid on time, it is starting to mess with my credit because of insufficient funds).  I do not want to be responsible for her phone bill anymore.  Its $50 that I don't need to worry about.  I've told her every time she was late that ""If you're late next month patty, I'm going to have to take you off my plan"" but, I've never had the guts too.  I felt bad. Also,  Doug is still a close friend of mine.  I know he would be furious with me if I did that.  He would probably never speak to me again.

I'm going on day three that she still owes me for the phone bill (Im asking for her to pay for my overdraft fee as well because if she had paid me on time, it wouldn't have happened.)


So I guess the question I want to ask is : Should I keep her on the phone bill and just wait for her to send me the money, or risk losing my friendship by dropping her?

TL;DR  My close friend's girl friend is on my ""family plan"" for cell phones.  She is ALWAYS late, and because she forgot to pay me, I'm getting notices about insufficient funds (which I don't think is good for my credit). I've warned her for several months that if she keeps if up, I would drop her.  I've never been able to though, because I'm afraid to lose my friendship with my close friend (her boyfriend).  Should I take the risk of losing the friendship?

Edit: Forgot some details."
xupim,19,2012-08-07,I've never been so disappointed in myself,john_smith1882,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/xupim/ive_never_been_so_disappointed_in_myself/,"I've done a lot of things that have made me not want to look at myself in the mirror. Terrible things. Usually though, I feel bad because of the way I've hurt others. It's the ways that you let *yourself* down that hurt the most.

If you want more backstory, I'll link some older posts in this summary. I usually chronicle my bad craziness for the amusement of others. Basically, I am on probation [for a DUI](http://redd.it/lebo7) with an alcohol restriction. It is 100% illegal for me to even possess alcohol, let alone have a BAC other than zero. I have fucked up before and gotten caught drinking. I also [had an incident](http://redd.it/vji0b) where no one could prove that I had been drunk, but everyone knew. 

I have been on probation for 8 months (out of 18. Why is that even a number. Fuck.) and I have not quit drinking except for a brief (2 weeks) period in February (? maybe, not sure). Even then I went on a mad Vicodin binge. Basically I haven't been sober (pot, pills, hallucenogens, and of course alcohol) since the age of 13.

**So now to the story at hand.**

I was supposed to go to the courthouse this afternoon for my probation meeting. I've done this 8 FUCKING TIMES now, kindling is a bitch and I hate it. I taper/shitshow withdrawal, whatever the case may be for the 2-3 before my probation meetings. This time, I started tapering Sunday afternoon for a Tuesday meeting. 

I'm supposed to be in my PO's office at 6pm. It's 5:30pm and I am literally shaking like a leaf. You can see my diaphragm twitching through my shirt. My hand's might as well be humming bird wings. I started to have auditory hallucinations (read:voices, not just noises) which is a first fro me. And of course I can see those **FUCKING YELLOW AND BLACK BEETLES** everywhere! God, I hate those things. I have reoccurring nightmares about them being in my food/drink.

I start to get crazy paranoid. Consider that I have only been just drinking enough to stave off shakes for 48 fucking hours! I can't even leave the house. Even if I did make it to the courthouse on time, I would be so visibly shaky that my PO would have ordered a blood test, and I would likely go to jail.

So I called and rescheduled my meeting. This is highly frowned upon for the substance restricted probationers. Luckily I spoke with my PO's intern. I can lie to bitch ass college kids all day, but my PO is too wise to buy any sort of excuses.

Now all I can do it hope that I can manage to taper more successfully by next Tuesday.

I know this doesn't sound too awfully bad, but let me explain. I've fucked up enough in 8 months that if I have one more violation of my probation, my case goes back to court. The circuit that my charge originated in is a harsh one. If I am prosecuted to the full extent of the law, I will serve no less than six months in jail.

Six months is just long enough to permanently fuck your life up. I would loose my job, I would renig on my lease for my apartment, my entire family (hell, the entire town) would know that I'd been lying about being sober for 8 months... My girlfriend would probably leave me, my cats would go to a shelter because no one could take care of them while I was in jail. 

Maybe I'm blowing this out of proportion. I have a tendency to do that. But I really feel like shit.

Sorry I'm being whiny tonight, but I could really use some support and advice.

thanks for reading, this next drink is for you magnificent bastards"

I decided I wanted to slowly bulk up while I used keto to boost my fat loss, so I chose to follow the Lyle Mcdonald CKG diet. 

Here is what I started at [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/cvxvj.jpg) face shot, and [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/OeCYi.jpg) whole body shot.

While being on the CKD* I ate a surplus of calories on days I lifted and a deficit on my rest days. I also carb loaded for only 12 hours every week instead of 36. I first used SS to build my basic strength back up, then moved onto to a split routine after 4 months.

Here is me 30 pounds down, and way of better shape :)

Classic Grouchy Keto face [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/WcZRU.jpg), and a shirtless shot [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/qxZW6.jpg)

Feel free to ask me anything about it

Edit: I'm 23 years old, I just look like a child :D

Since I was asked about it, just to make it easier for people who want to know; CKD*(I need to edit that) is a cycling ketogenic diet. If you want to build a lot of mass while lifting you need to take in some carbs to refeed your muscles. So with CKD you eat like you normally would on the keto diet for six days. But on the seventh day you reverse the percentages of macros you are taking in. So instead of the normal (what I eat) 55% fat, 40% protein, and 5% carbs you intake 55% carbs, 40% protein, and 5% fat(oops had carbs there by accident)* during that one day. CKD is only good for people that will be lifting weights heavily during the keto diet. And SS is the Starting Strength program, which is a great lifting program to build up the muscle and strength foundation you will need to not injure yourself during more advanced lifting routines later on. Well at least that is my experience and opinion, there is no one correct way to get healthy :D

Edit: Fixed my english* This quarterly closing at my finance internship has melted my brain...&lt;($_$)&gt;

xx3gi,2,2012-08-08,Going to buy a Macbook Pro soon. Couple of questions!,FLDJF713,applehelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/applehelp/comments/xx3gi/going_to_buy_a_macbook_pro_soon_couple_of/,"Hello all. I'm going to buy a 13'' Macbook Pro (non-retina, 2.5GHz) for school (CS-major). I will be using it for:

* All Microsoft applications
* Most Adobe applications
* Simple stuff like web surfing, etc...

I think the most intensive thing I will be doing will casually editing video on Final Cut Pro. My old 2006 IMac with 1 GB of RAM held up OK doing this, so hopefully the Pro can do well.

I have a couple of questions pertaining to it:

1. Should I buy it online at Apple or go to the store in the mall? 

2. Is there an option to waive the $100 gift card to the App store and instead get like the bluetooth mouse worth $60?

3. When I get the education discount, what proof do I need to show them in store? I don't have my school ID yet, but would like an acceptance or scholarship letter work?

4. Where do you find those stickers people put on the backs of their Macbooks that option incorporate the glowing Apple?

5. I'm going to get the 8GB RAM option. Is is a huge difference from the 4GB RAM?

6. I've been using a Pro at my internship. It gets pretty hot. Is this with all Pros, or just a dud?"
xx2y4,7,2012-08-08,I HATE my mother beyond everything else. It's so consuming that I'm numb to most other emotions.,MsLT,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/xx2y4/i_hate_my_mother_beyond_everything_else_its_so/,"I'm adopted from birth, and I consider my adoptive mother my ""mother."" My birth mother/father are irrelevant to me.

Anyway.

I can't stand my mother. Everything she says is belittling or a flat-out lie. She yells at me for having an ""eating disorder"" because I'm a vegetarian (and have been for 10 years now). She yells at me for my grades, even though they've been getting better. She hates that I'm not enough like my (also adopted) sister; my sister is very affectionate, cuddly, and bratty. She will call our father and demand money from him even if she hasn't seen him in 6 months or longer.

I am the more studious child. I read and study a lot, and am not interested in fashion, pop culture, celebrities, or anything of the sort. I prefer to sit in my room with a comic book, or playing WoW, or reading the biggest book I can find. I'm fairly talented with words. I worked two internships over the summer, but because they were not ""normal"" hours she says they don't count. My sister failed her first year of college, and yet I'm always the fuck up. I'm the black sheep of the family. I want tattoos and piercings galore, though at the moment she only knows about my ears and nose being pierced (and even though she paid for my sister's upper ear piercing, she won't even talk about the fact I want one, plus my sister's belly button). 

She always fights with me loudly in the house, screaming at me about things that either I cannot change or don't currently have the means to change, but intend to get to. For example, she'll yell at me because she forgot to buy vegetarian things when she went food shopping, even though I don't get to use the car and I left multiple shopping lists all around the house.

Whenever she approaches me, it's rarely friendly. It's always an accusation or something to blame me for. Her voice sends my temper immediately through the roof and I have no idea how to control it anymore. I'm usually very in control of myself, but lately I've found myself screaming ""You can go fuck yourself!"" and slamming doors, and that's really not in my character. I hate how irrational she makes me, but every word from her mouth cuts me to the quick.

I don't even think she has the authority to talk down to me. She has no job and NEVER worked in her life. She has no college education, and she had a nanny to ""help"" (read: do it for her) raise me and my sister. My father pays for everything, and my current step-father is stressed by her overwhelming spending. He pays for his own kids' college, for the house we all live in, the food we eat.. All my mother does is spend money and talk on the phone all day. I can't stand anything about her. She turns up the TV volume so nobody can talk to each other, and demands that what SHE wants on the TV is playing, even if EVERYONE ELSE combined wants to watch a different program. She is always screaming at someone else and NEVER takes credit for when she makes mistakes. She never apologizes for the things she does, even if she's blatantly wrong. She handles fights like a child, by whispering about the person she's fighting with, loudly, to the nearest person to her.. And that just makes whoever she's fighting with more angry because of how fucking childish it is.

At this point, all her belittling me and screaming at me is becoming far too much for me. I fantasize about hurting her badly. I want to punch her and break her nose or sternum. I want to stomp on her feet and feel the crunch of bones. I collect blades and would love the chance to show her EXACTLY how sharp they are. I know it's so many kinds of sick and fucked up, but if I just had TEN MINUTES to physically fight her, I'm sure I'd kill her without a second thought about it."
xwy8y,1,2012-08-08,This is as good a place as any,caligaris_cabinet,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/xwy8y/this_is_as_good_a_place_as_any/,"Well I guess I should start out with the basics. I'm 23, 24 in a couple of days. In my senior year of college going for my BA in film production. White male, if anyone cares to know. 

And I cannot remember a time I was truly happy. 

To be perfectly honest I really only started realizing this today, after a girl I liked flat-out rejected me last night. Whatever. Shit happens. But on my drive back from my internship (a kickass one, I might add) I started realizing that nothing in my life has ever made me truly happy for an amount longer than a few days. I've noticed over the years (probably since high school) that while something may temporarily make me happy (a recent example would be me getting a temporary job as a PA on a major TV show) it would always, always, be followed by something that would take me from cloud 9 to rock bottom. 

I don't know if this is depression or not, but I've been feeling this way a long time. 

Alcohol helps, but it's like putting a bandage on a broken leg. Even as I pour myself my third glass of scotch in an hour, I know it is only a temporary fix. 

I have friends. Good ones. My family (however small it is) loves and supports me for the most part. There's no truly horrific mental scars that I am aware of. However, I look on at my friends and family (most of whom have a S.O.) and they are more or less happy. I only truly loved two girls in my life. One tried to commit suicide twice while we were dating (the second time I actually saw it happen), and the other lives three thousand miles away and is about to move even farther away. We've known and liked each other for almost ten years but never actually dated because life got in the way. I've tried to start a relationship with other girls around here but none seem to find me attractive unless they're loaded with more psychological problems than I'm willing to deal with. I have my own issues to work out first before I take anyone else's on. Yet here I am alone, sitting on my porch drinking scotch and troubling you fine people with my mundane problems. 

I talk with my parents. They say I need to open myself up more and essentially get out more. Well I have to work constantly to keep up a standard of living I prefer (and it's not luxurious by any means) so I miss out on much of the student socializing hours during the weekends. Plus, I love writing and find myself spending more time doing that than socializing. However, I do attend the obligatory college parties. Hell, thanks to a room mate that has more charisma than any one man should have, I often attended parties at my own house. But I never felt connected to anyone or even having a good time. I would try to hook up with a girl but it would nearly always fail. I won't talk with my friends about this because I believe that problems and emotions should be kept inside where they belong. 

On the topic of emotions, I view them as weakness. Although I desperately wish to feel as others seem to do, I bury mine deep down. I refuse to open my heart to anyone and would rather be cold than allow myself to be vulnerable. I wish I could open myself up to someone. But I realized a long time ago that the only person in life I can rely on is myself. Family and friends have let me down in the past and I constantly put the needs of others before myself. Letting others win and get ahead in life to try and be happy for them. Not to say I don't have my own ambitions. I am paving a road to what could be an amazing career. But I did alone. Because I am alone. And I've come to realize I will probably die alone. 

I welcome death and do not fear it. But I am not suicidal. No, I'd rather be an abominable cyst on the world than give it the satisfaction of self termination. Though, when my number's up and the reaper comes face to face with me, I will greet him with open arms.  

Job success only does so much but cannot fill the void in my life that another supportive, understanding human being could. However, that woman doesn't exist. And if she does, I will likely ignore/screw it up with her. 

I feel empty and hollow. And I doubt I will make it to my next birthday if I continue along this path. I now seek to avoid happiness and emotions because of the pain that usually follows. I would rather feel nothing but I know I can't last much longer if I do that. 

To conclude this rant, I'm not asking for help or advice (I don't believe in such things) but feel free to respond as you will. I posted this here because feeling depressed and needing alcohol to sooth it seemed to fall in line with the other posts here. 

TL;DR: I am afraid of happiness and avoid emotions like the plague. 

Hats off to anyone who can make sense out of this.  "
xwvmz,6,2012-08-08,How can I step up my chainmaille production?,Shadow_Volkrove,DIY,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/xwvmz/how_can_i_step_up_my_chainmaille_production/,"To begin, I will go over my process with you, and share a few links that are similar to what I am doing.   

* Using 14gauge [wire](http://www.homedepot.com/h_d1/N-5yc1v/R-100141392/h_d2/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10053&amp;langId=-1&amp;keyword=16gauge+wire&amp;storeId=10051#.UCMCz6Bl6lU) I create [coils](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rf5STtnQy8). This step is relatively fast, easy and is a common tutorial that I wish I would have started with. (when I began I made my own from trial and error. luckily I came to the same conclusions as these gentlemen.

* Next I make rings. There are multiple methods for turning coils into rings. 
&gt; * There is [Bolt Cutters](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WyW_fHWbMI) &amp; [Aviation Snips] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WyW_fHWbMI). (I currently use aviation snips).    
&gt; * There is the [hack saw](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2M-QrKynnM) &amp; [dremel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6aoscz0qNs) methods, I don't own a vice grips. Moreover, these methods seem clumsier and just as slow as my current one.     
&gt; * The [scroll saw/hack saw#2] (http://www.instructables.com/id/Scroll-saw-jig-for-cutting-jump-rings/) method.   
&gt; * And last, but not least there is the [""Ringinator""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl54XoTSfIQ). This is pricy and they were cutting Aluminum not steel.

* Now your rings have been cut and you have a pile of them. The next step for me is straightening about 2/3 of them and soldering them together with a 45w Soldering iron. This looks pretty good and solid. A professional/person with more money than me might use this [bad boy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQ6ifucFhY). Lately, I have been skipping this step because it is aesthetic more than anything &amp; I've just closed the rings together.

* Now with the other 1/3 of the rings you want to combine them in a patter, I prefer the [4in1 European](http://cgmaille.com/tutorials/e4-1.shtml), I make batches of what I call Clovers where I take 4 closed rings and put 1 through them. Then after using up all the rings I can, I turn all the clovers into ribbons. Ribbons are basically up to step 4 in the last [link](http://cgmaille.com/tutorials/e4-1.shtml). Each ribbon is 12x2 and then I connect 6 ribbons to make a patch. I have found this handy &amp; quick. Then I connect the patches and so forth until I have a garment. Now this is just my personal method (I joke that I McDonaldized it, but that's a tangent)

**DIY Request** : So the problem that I am having is that I want to speed up my ring making and closing. I kinda hope to actually McDonaldize the process. I am very slow and go through snips reasonably quickly, but the other methods either cost too much or are just as bad as my current method for different reasons. I assume that people make these as a business and I doubt they just have an intern or something sitting around with aviation snips. How can I improve?"
xwur2,7,2012-08-08,"""Uh huh.. can we go faster now?""",[deleted],GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/xwur2/uh_huh_can_we_go_faster_now/,"I've been working out and studying my ass off like crazy since January. I have you wolves to thank to keep me on track.

Anyway, it started back in January when I got my first semester's law school grades back. I had spent my whole life thinking that because school was always easy that law school was going to be easy as well. I also thought that because I was always a pretty decent athlete that I was always going to be in good shape and that I would never have to worry about being in good health. I received my grades, and while I was still in the majority of the curve, I was given the harsh reality of my limits. I stared at my grades on the screen and realized that I was no longer the ""Mr. Invincible"" that I had once thought that I was. The bar was raised. I was around tons of people, all of whom were the ""Mister or Miss Fantastic"" in their own realms. All of a sudden I was in the major leagues, and being faced with the reality of this, I tried to console myself with the fact that I was still a good looking guy with good athleticism.

I ran to a mirror and just stared at myself. I wasn't what I used to be. I got lackadaisical. I was out of shape. I was not the lean and muscular boxing champion that I once was. I was heavy footed, had a second chin coming in, and I didn't have the spring in my step that I used to. ""For fuck's sake ringside, you're in your mid-twenties,"" I thought to myself. I grabbed my gut and just shook it. I shook my head in disgust and immediately changed into my workout clothes.

Since January 1st, I have only missed a total of 5 days of working out. This was because of either travel or the gym just being outright closed. I still stretch on those days, to try and make the most of things. I also have studied every day and read multiple books on how I could improve my legal writing ability and get the hell out of the academic rut I was in. 

Since then I've lost about 50 lbs and have a ripped six-pack for the first time in years. I see my jawline much more distinctly than I used to, my complexion has cleared up, and girls that I would never think would talk to me won't leave me alone now. In addition, my new motivation to do well in school has opened up incredible networking opportunities and I landed a paid internship that takes care of my tuition and guarantees that I will have a steady job that pays well into the six-figure range after I graduate law school.

Anyway, I was turning my improved circumstances over and over in my mind as I was doing my daily run. I then realized how much easier it was to complete my run in a good time since I started my new devotion to my self-improvement. It felt great. Then my body (figuratively) responded to me by saying, ""Uh huh... can we go faster now?"" Changed me forever. I want to keep improving despite having already come so far. I don't want to stop, because when the sky is the limit, how could I let myself retain a self-imposed limit? I have no reason to.

My response (figuratively): ""Yes, and we will.""

Thank you from the bottom of my heart, wolves.

**tl;dr: Thanks to you guys, I was able to stay on track and go through a crazy period of self improvement and saved my grades and my body. I also plan on keeping this trend going for as long as I can.**"
y0qk9,11,2012-08-10,Has anyone else noticed this or is it just me?,Fotograph,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/y0qk9/has_anyone_else_noticed_this_or_is_it_just_me/,"So the other day I (a 20 year old female) was commuting home from my internship on the train, sitting by myself at the end of the car where four seats face each other. Usually no one will sit across from you there because its pretty awkward, so I was planning on a nice relaxing ride alone. A guy around my age (20's) asks if he can sit with me because he needs to use the power outlet under one of the seats to charge his phone. Of course I say its fine and then we get to talking about phones, and then battery life, and then computers and one thing leads to another and were having a nice conversation. Now here comes the real point to my story. At no point in this conversation did I mention having a boyfriend and the fact that I'm in a committed relationship. From experience I knew that if I did, this guy would most likely slowly taper off our conversation until we were just sitting there in silence. 

Why is it that so many men will give up a perfectly pleasant conversation, just because they know they have no shot at having a relationship with a girl? Have we forgotten everything else besides becoming a couple/getting laid? So much so that we are willing to cast off everyone who we have no intention of forming an intimate relationship with.

I find that this also works the other way around. Ive witnessed female friends blatantly ignore men who have girlfriends because they say ""Whats the point"" 

Is it just me?

xzrav,3,2012-08-10,need some advice regarding my situation,knittzsche,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/xzrav/need_some_advice_regarding_my_situation/,"So some weeks ago i went on a date with a girl who i had been chatting with a lot online! We kinda knew eachother a bit since we went to the same school and have alot of friends in common, but we never met until now a couple years later (she does not live in the same city anymore and she was home for the summer). Anyway i built up the courage to ask her on a date while i could! It all went GREAT and i really mean great i think we hit it off really good and as soon as i started talking to her all of my nervousness went away and it felt so relaxed and she ended up staying the night at my place! I really just fell flat for this girl i think. We have so much in common and we have similar intrrests and opinions!

Anyway she does not live anywhere near me at the moment and she left 3 days after our date (she spent her last day/night with me aswell and it was awesome!) I followed her when she left and we said goodbye and all that. Of course i was sad that she had to leave but thats how life is i guess! Anyway i really want do anything to try to be with this girl! But i feel so insecure about the situation since it all went so fast when she was here. When she got home we continued to chat with eachother and so on! After some days/week after she came back home i noticed she started to reply slowly to my messages and often with shorter sentances and i could tell something was up, but after a while i kinda asked her about it and she said it was because she had lots to do and meeting all of her friends again after the summer and so on. It made me relifed and i completley understand that!

After a while(some days) i told her i wanted to come and visit her before she started her internship/school again and she seemed really happy about it and i was too, but then again whenever i wrote her i got a response maybe late and something casual for an anwser something you would type to your friend instead of your lover i guess ( even though we only had 2 dates in 3 days dosnt make us lovers but it makes us something i guess ) anyway i asked her again if she was sure about me visiting her and made sure i was not forcing anything or putting any stress/pressure on her, she said i wasnt but she said she had a fing with a guy up there before the summer and she didnt have the same feeling for him and she was a bit scared of any drama that might happen if i came up there and she had not told this guy how things stood between them. This made me panic a little bit ofc but i trusted her and said she should just follow her heart (cheesy right? yeah im not good at this stuff)

Now after some weeks i feel like im the only one engaging in conversation i am always the one to text her first and i feel so pathetic and loneley when im the only one to start any conversations and so on ( this part sounds like some highschool drama i know) but anyway im just so unsure about how to handle this situation it seems as if ims till going to visit her sometime before september. The other day i tried to ask her about the fastest/cheapest way to travel to her city if she still wanted me to come! She gave me an anwser that she was unsure and she honestly didnt know wich dates i could come because of her schedule but she said she wanted to see me again because it might be the last chance before her internship for school started (could be anywhere in the world/country) so i guess thats good. After that the subject kinda got changed and not much more was said. And my main question is how to i handle this situation without putting to much pressure and possibly scaring her away i guess? I dont know how she really feels and i dont think she does either. But i know what i feel or want atleast i love talking to her and she is currently the only thing/one in my life that makes me truely happy. Since this might turn out to some long-distance thing im really scared i will lose her : /

Tl;dr started chatting with a girl whom i kinda known since before we went on a date it went great she spent 2 nights with me... Girl had to leave to go home i want to keep this thing going even if it means long distance not sure what she feels etc what should i do to not mess it up?

Sorry if the spelling/grammar is bad, i kinda just vented this into text also english is not my native lanugage.


I am a 22 year old guy and i have suffered from depression ever since i broke up with my ex 1.5 years ago and this has made me really vulnerable and afraid of getting invested in someone else since it hurt me so bad in the past. But i feel like i need to pursue this since we have so much in common its almost unreal. Any advice on how i should deal with this without being to pushy/desperate and ""scaring"" her away.

Edit: Spelling/grammar



UPDATE: She just posted a picture on facebook with her making out/cuddling with some guy so i guess this thing is not happening i just dont understand why she could not just tell me.. How stupid i feel.. Back to my depressed everyday life now with less hope anyway im glad i didnt book any trip atleast i can spend the money on something else now...

xzdy1,3,2012-08-10,[22M] cuts contact with best friend [23F],[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/xzdy1/22m_cuts_contact_with_best_friend_23f/,"We met online a little over a year ago, on a music site. I had been adding random people who had similar music interests. I found a song I really liked and sent it out to a few of these people I added who I thought might like it as well. She responded and we started talking, added each other on facebook, and everything just clicked. Same interests, etc. (I know, I know.. I feel silly about the whole ""online"" thing. Honestly I felt so lucky to find someone I clicked with so much this way, though.)

 IRL I was extremely shy around that time - still am, but I've made a lot of progress over the past year (partially thanks to her, I think) - but with her I could connect to a degree that I could/had not with other people around me. Could talk a lot more, not just in general chat/joking around, but about really personal things (sometimes I 
think I might have let her see too much of my emotions when I would get depressed, though - I'd let all my filters down even though it seemed like I might regret showing all my weakness - I don't know how much one is generally supposed to hide these things). 
 
 After a couple of months I started developing strong feelings for her. A little bit later I confessed this to her, and she said stuff to the effect of ""i've never had romantic feelings for anyone"" (I've been doing some reading around here and I know what people will say about this - spare me), but then a little later again she said something that indicated she might have had some feelings for me too. but only briefly, I think I fucked it up almost immediately with insecure behavior.

I was in a funk for a bit, but then towards the end of the year we started talking more and it seemed we were getting even closer than before. She started telling me she loved me, in a non-romantic way. And the truth is I loved her too in a platonic way, just a pure love for another human being, but I still desired a more intimate ('romantic') kind of love with her as well. She was the best friend I'd had.

A couple months more later, our contact starts to die down. It also looks as if she's having a relationship with some guy, which hurt me a lot. There were other girls IRL at school that I talked to, etc., but I found that emotionally &amp; intellectually I still wanted my friend much more than any of them. I couldn't be angry with her or anything for it, given the situation, but it started to be too much to bear, so I cut off contact with her the first time.

After a few weeks I felt like I was over it and could handle it, and reestablished contact with her, wanting our friendship back. Then there was another resurgence of contact, and she started saying I should visit her IRL (we didn't live terribly far away, just a few hours apart), at the apartment she'd be in for the summer.

I started making plans for this in June, but a little bit in between the time I started making plans and the time I was supposed to see her she told me that one of her 'roommates' she mentioned before was actually her boyfriend. It hurt, a lot, but I still went along with the plans, ignoring/pretending I didn't care about it.

I cringe at this now. I had considered canceling the trip when I found out - but at the time I felt I'd rather not never meet her at all. Thought I could brush it aside and have fun anyway. Needless to say, it wasn't at all fun sleeping on the couch outside their little love nest while I stayed over for the weekend. Felt like shit after that.

I told her how I felt about the trip a few days later. She said that we could try visiting again sometime, but then didn't talk much for a bit. 
Then we started talking again and I brought up another opportunity for us to meet, but she had some excuse, and then didn't talk to me for a much longer time. Then had some excuse about her computer being broken. All this time I had only been feeling worse and worse about the trip and thinking about her with her boyfriend. In our last 
conversation we started talking like normal again, and it was a bit happy, but I couldn't stand it for too long. I couldn't do this all over again.

Now, as the shy kid I was, I had very little relationship experience and never had anyone to seek for advice on such matters. I've been reading around these parts on reddit recently and noticed a lot of the (big) mistakes I've made along the way. I have a general idea of how people are going to respond to this post - the whole thing does look rather pathetic, typed out like this. Although, I don't think this outline does much justice to the relationship, leaving out all of the conversations and things we've shared - all of the personal stuff that leads to the emotional bonds we form - just another skeleton of a relationship that starts to sound like any number of other posts on here about ""best friends"" and unrequited love.

I think what most people here will say is to just move on. It's that trite little answer that I'd hate to accept. But I told her how I felt one last time, that I couldn't keep going through this cycle and that I thought we couldn't be friends anymore. She said I could block her, but it would be a loss for her, and I accepted. Of course I regret and it feel like I was too hasty to accept that now. Now I feel just as bad about all those other things, but even worse because I don't know if I'll ever talk to her again.

As I said, I didn't have anyone else to talk to or ask for advice. Over the past few months the people I've known IRL have drifted apart; I've been stuck at a 9-5(but usually until 6 or 7) internship all day this summer (so I'm unable to keep the usual meet-ups I used to have with the old friends, and have very few hours left to do anything when I get home to my boring ass highway enclosed suburb) and the people at the office are a much older crowd, so I don't socialize much there; and I'll be transferring to a different university this fall, where I don't know anybody.

So I've cut off my best friend and my only friend, and it feels truly awful. I guess the alternative wasn't acceptable either - damned if I do/don't. I just want to ask here if I made the right choice, or if there's any hope that this doesn't have to be goodbye forever to someone I really admire. Even if I think I already know what your answer is going to be.

tl;dr: Developed feelings for best friend I've had who I met online; cut off contact because it hurts too much when she's in a relationship with someone else. Should I completely end it?"
xzdac,1,2012-08-10,Advice on how to handle (not mess it up) this situation.,knittzsche,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/xzdac/advice_on_how_to_handle_not_mess_it_up_this/,"So some weeks ago i went on a date with a girl who i had been chatting with a lot online! We kinda knew eachother a bit since we went to the same school and have alot of friends in common, but we never met until now a couple years later (she does not live in the same city anymore and she was home for the summer). Anyway i built up the courage to ask her on a date while i could! It all went GREAT and i really mean great i think we hit it off really good and as soon as i started talking to her all of my nervousness went away and it felt so relaxed and she ended up staying the night at my place! I really just fell flat for this girl i think. We have so much in common and we have similar intrrests and opinions! 

Anyway she does not live anywhere near me at the moment and she left 3 days after our date (she spent her last day/night with me aswell and it was awesome!) I followed her when she left and we said goodbye and all that. Of course i was sad that she had to leave but thats how life is i guess! Anyway i really want do anything to try to be with this girl! But i feel so insecure about the situation since it all went so fast when she was here. When she got home we continued to chat with eachother and so on! After some days/week after she came back home i noticed she started to reply slowly to my messages and often with shorter sentances and i could tell something was up, but after a while i kinda asked her about it and she said it was because she had lots to do and meeting all of her friends again after the summer and so on. It made me relifed and i completley understand that! 

After a while(some days) i told her i wanted to come and visit her before she started her internship/school  again and she seemed really happy about it and i was too, but then again whenever i wrote her i got a response maybe late and something casual for an anwser something you would type to your friend instead of your lover i guess ( even though we only had 2 dates in 3 days dosnt make us lovers but it makes us something i guess ) anyway i asked her again if she was sure about me visiting her and made sure i was not forcing anything or putting any stress/pressure on her, she said i wasnt but she said she had a fing with a guy up there before the summer and she didnt have the same feeling for him and she was a bit scared of any drama that might happen if i came up there and she had not told this guy how things stood between them. This made me panic a little bit ofc but i trusted her and said she should just follow her heart (cheesy right? yeah im not good at this stuff) 

Now after some weeks i feel like im the only one engaging in conversation i am always the one to text her first  and i feel so pathetic and loneley when im the only one to start any conversations and so on ( this part sounds like some highschool drama i know) but anyway im just so unsure about how to handle this situation it seems as if ims till going to visit her sometime before september. The other day i tried to ask her about the fastest/cheapest way to travel to her city if she still wanted me to come! She gave me an anwser that she was unsure and she honestly didnt know wich dates i could come because of her schedule but she said she wanted to see me again because it might be the last chance before her internship for school started (could be anywhere in the world/country) so i guess thats good. After that the subject kinda got changed and not much more was said. And my main question is how to i handle this situation without putting to much pressure and possibly scaring her away i guess? I dont know how she really feels and i dont think she does either. But i know what i feel or want atleast i love talking to her and she is currently the only thing/one in my life that makes me truely happy. Since this might turn out to some long-distance thing im really scared i will lose her : /

Tl;dr started chatting with a girl whom i kinda known since before we went on a date it went great she spent 2 nights with me... Girl had to leave to go home i want to keep this thing going even if it means long distance not sure what she feels etc what should i do to not mess it up?

Sorry if the spelling/grammar is bad, i kinda just vented this into text also english is not my native lanugage.

xzbye,20,2012-08-10,I'm not a CS major (pure&amp;applied math) but I really like C. What could I look into if I wanted to get part time/summer work as a C programmer?,[deleted],C_Programming,https://www.reddit.com/r/C_Programming/comments/xzbye/im_not_a_cs_major_pureapplied_math_but_i_really/,"Hello!

C is the very first programming language I was introduced to (about 8 years ago by a neighbour who pretty much got me into computers in the first place). I never worked as a programmer but it's always been a hobby of mine. I often was told by friends who study CS that I should look into other languages but there's something about C I can't really describe that makes me want to stick with it. I get the same speech from people in my faculty (there's a lot of Python going around in the mathematics department) but again, when I'm not working on school-related assignments I like to play around with C.

I've taken quite a few CS classes over the year (started my undergrad as a CS major before switching to mathematics) and at this point I feel pretty confident with my knowledge of both the language and the important foundations of computer science in general. I've never worked in the field though and I'd like to change that. A few friends recommended I look into web development as an easy way to get a job in the field but I really can't stand it.

The problem is I don't really know what I'm suppose to look into to gain enough knowledge and experience (on my own) that would make me qualify for a job writing code in C. I've been looking at open source projects written in C to gain some inspiration but I'm still a bit lost.

I guess the ideal answer I'm expecting from this post would be from someone who is in a position (or as the knowledge to be) who could be in a situation where they'd be hiring a young programmer to work with C. What would expect them to know? What kind of experience should they have? Are there any small projects I could build on my own that would be a good showcase of my skills? When I look around I see a lot of engineering jobs who use C to work on machine code but that seems a bit unrealistic for me to dabble into right now (I've been looking into getting an Arduino board though)

Thanks a lot!

**tl;dr:** Math major, never going to get work experience as a C programmer from internships, would like to build a 'portfolio' while increasing my knowledge of the language to possibly get a job as a junior C programmer."
xzbo0,0,2012-08-10,[15f] Guy best friend [15m] that I kinda like maybe likes me back. . .,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/xzbo0/15f_guy_best_friend_15m_that_i_kinda_like_maybe/,"I'm 15 and really independent (have been all my life) and I've never been in a romantic relationship, much less felt this way about a guy. So, about 8 months ago, my guy best friend (let's call him John) came to me and told me he liked my girl best friend (let's call her Jenny). Now, Jenny had been with different guys that I would have considered friends that had used me to convey their message, and I never felt jealous about that; but this time I felt really hurt. Jenny had told me that she really dislikes John, so not wanting to hurt my friendship with either of them, I told John that it was his decision and to confront her himself. I realized that I had felt jealous of Jenny, but since no further discussion of this came to me from either of them, I shut it out and didn't really think about it. 

Flash forward about 4 months, and John told me, and I quote, ""Jenny will never have a decent boyfriend because she's too unpredictable."" Which made my heart skip a beat, something I've never experienced before. A week later, I was freaking out about a final I had and decided to take a walk in the half hour before school started. He followed me and the entire conversation was him ranting on and on about his two previous girlfriends and how he didn't even think they had a legitimate relationship together. I felt like really jealous about this and kinda snapped at him about how the other girls treated him, and luckily he agreed with me. Anyway, that day was the last day of school, and about 3 weeks later, I had a dream about Johnn texting me and confessing his love for me. This was the absolute first romantic dream I've ever ever ever had about anyone. Ever. But it felt. . .right. That day he called me, which all my friends tell me is the sweetest thing they've ever heard a 15 year old guy do, and we made plans in a group. All summer, he would text me and then wait for me to text back and then call me just to talk about stuff, or if I texted him then he would call me. I've also had 4 or 5 more dreams about him, which is a lot considering I only remember my dreams maybe once or twice a week. We've hung out in a group a couple of times, and he always like stands or sits by me. Then this Wednesday, we had this internship at a place where it was just the two of us and the guy we were shadowing, and he gave me this smile that made me week in the knees (never happened before), he called me smart in front of 3 different people (also never happened before), held doors open for me all day (you guessed it), and tried to show his strength in front of me (see: last three parentheses). Then Thursday me, John and Jenny were making plans to get our school schedules when he asked me for her number, which I gave him and then he called her like, right away. They didn't talk about anything about substance according to Jenny. But him calling her made me feel really stupid for thinking he liked me, and also jealous, even though he told me he didn't like her. Our plans fell through to pick up our schedules and I though Jenny was mad at me because she wasn't answering my texts, and then John texted me saying that we had 4 classes together (:D). I told him my situation with Jenny and he said, ""If she wants to be mad at you for that, then forget her. Don't worry."" which made my heart skip a beat, I don't even know why. 

So, in the hours since his last comment, I realized Jenny wasn't mad at me-- she just couldn't get any bars, and that I had fallen for John, whether I wanted to or not. I have absolutely no experience in this and I came here in hope of an unbiased opinion(s) (ex; girlfriends, sisters, mom). Thanks for reading this far, and here are my two main questions:

**tl;dr** Guy bestfriend told me he liked girl bestfriend, I experienced jealousy, possible flirtation and sweetness for the first time, and just recently have fallen for him. Does he like me? If he does, what should I do?"

",EDPostRequests,EatingDisorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/xz4ik/post_request_i_keep_relapsing_and_it_is_hurting/,"I need some help, I am hoping to find a bit of advice, or help, or encouragement..honestly something/anything. I keep relapsing and it is hurting me.

In high school, I was slightly overweight (from living next door to a grandma who loved to bake and cook and 'the ""good girl"" cleaned her full plate' sort of habits). I was uncomfortable in my skin, physically and mentally, heck I still am overall, but better than then. I wish I could blame it on anything/something, but I can't think of anything. I grew up in a fair/good home. My parents loved all of us equally. I am the youngest of 3 girls. I would try to say that they compared us and saw me as not measuring up to my sisters, but they never did anything to suggest that, it was all me...I was the one comparing. 

I don't even remember the first time anymore, other than it was HS sophomore year, but I started making myself sick. I would throw up food, I had various reasons at the time. I ate a ton, so I made myself sick. I was really nervous about ""x"",""y"" or ""z"".. I made myself sick. I was disappointed in myself, I made myself sick. It became my ""out""...my relief. I was throwing up 8-9 times a week. This continued and continued.

Senior year, I did really well. I had lost weight over the summer, and found a friend to talk to about what I was doing and everything that was going on. They would be there for me if I needed anyone about anything. I still made myself throw up, but not even close to what it had been before. I would have what I called ""relapse"" weeks. I would do well for months and then suddenly for a couple weeks to a month, I would be back to the ""old habit.""

I was really proud Senior summer, I didn't make myself sick..not even once. I went off to college, did well for about 3 months there and then I found myself going back to my old habit. Not as strongly as before, but I would get stressed about something, be upset about something, realize I gained some weight, read the back of a package and see the fat/calorie count, step on a scale, or know that something wasn't healthy that I had just shoved in my mouth...and sometimes..most times..even before I knew it I would find myself hiding in the bathroom.

I didn't take advantage of free counselling in college until my last semester of senior year, but by that point the ""doing well then relapse for a few weeks or longer"" had been a big habit of mine. It seemed to help, but I still relapsed while going to counselling. He strongly suggested I continue counselling after the semester was over and I graduated...but I never did.

I lived in the same college town for about 8 months after I finished coursework, then moved out of state, completed an internship to finish my degree and ended up staying there. It never seems to be as bad as in HS, but I still find myself running to the bathroom to ""fix"" something. My weight (which currently isn't overweight), my nerves, my stress, my sadness...

I don't...I don't know how to stop this. I am so ashamed of myself for doing this to myself. I am hurting myself physically (teeth, throat, etc) and def. emotionally. 

Please, any advice...encouragement, words of wisdom... Thank you..for anything."
xz3vb,13,2012-08-09,What's a good frugal car?,RabidCoyote,Frugal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/xz3vb/whats_a_good_frugal_car/,"Hey guys, 

I'll admit, I'm not the most frugal person but any means - I'm slowly getting better. My parents did nothing in the way of educating me about finance, and only now as I enter my 20s am I really starting to think about my cost outlays. Better late then never. 

It was my hope to live in the city I go to school in and be able to bike or take the train. However, my summer internship has lead to a promotion including a pay increase and I do enjoy the work I do - it's a great resume builder, pays well and gives me new connects. But it does require I get a car as it is simply not feasible to get from my apartment near school to my place of employment efficently via public transport. 

My last car was an Acura Integra - which I loved dearly, but is a commonly stolen car, encouraged me to drive too fast, was a favorite target of cops. 

This car is really only being used for going to the office 2-3x a week and the occasion run to the grocery store or BJs. I don't want to sink money into it. Cheap, efficently, semi-reliable transportation. I wanted to stay away from Accords and Civics as the area I live in...can be kind of shady, and I don't want a car that's a common theft target.

What's a good frugal bet? I was thinking a signficantly older Corolla, Tercel or Sentra might work. An SUV would be fine too and there's plenty of Cheerokee's for sale. And some GM / Fords. And pickups! I'm open to anything as low as it's low cost, lower insurance and not a hot theft target."

Lately I can't help feeling like I'm a loser, and it's getting to the point where it's invading my sleep and rendering me unable to think of much else. It's distracting, and culminating in pretty bad migraines.

I'm in college, and my grades are good I think, but I have that imposter syndrome so bad. I could get the highest grades and just put it down to being a fluke. I see so many genuinely talented people around me having a great easy time, and I'm just hanging on, pulling all nighters to stay on top of stuff.

I'm living at home - this is the big one for me - and it makes me feel so pathetic when people I know have their shit so together with apartments and houses. I can't afford to rent/dorm honestly, and I don't qualify for any sort of assistance from the state. I could take another job but my grades would suffer and compound the stress I feel when studying. Should I borrow? I don't want to go into debt either :(

I have an internship, and I'm lucky to be working with cool people on tech that helps vulnerable members of society. But because of it, my social life is pretty bad, I have a few friends but we don't hang out enough because we live far away and work. Friday nights I am exhausted and generally always have those dark rings around my eyes.

So, I'm not enjoying college, feel like a loser, and don't have a social life. Do I need help? How can I calm down? Am I indeed a loser?"
y28nn,4,2012-08-11,"[24M] Long time redditor/lurker, first time thread maker. Please help me, for I am running out of places to go ask for help :-(. Year old breakup not going well...",pakidan23,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/y28nn/24m_long_time_redditorlurker_first_time_thread/,"Okay, I guess a back-story is much needed. I'm a 24 year old male who has been in a relationship with someone with someone since my freshman year in college and I thought it was with the One. I know it's a cliche, but I'm not the type of guy who dates random people for fun and see if it goes well. I'm usually shy and only go out with someone who has the potential for a long-term relationship. So when I entered my first relationship at 17, I thought I hit the lottery! Super-cute, a year older, got brains and experience...it was love at first sight. Despite being a Muslim and Pakistani, she being a Hindu and Indian, I thought it would still work out as long as we wanted to.

After years of being together, the honeymoon phase started to wane. She started to have a shorter fuse, arguing more and more and taking advantage of my kindness. I thought I was doing something wrong so I tried harder, only to end things off after two years. I felt being taken advantaged of, even though I still loved her. Eventually in 2009, I was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis (MS, an arthritic auto-immune disease that attacks the host's nerves and eventually renders the patient immobile, unable to do anything that involves nerves...which is everything). Despite being unphased and only a month away from graduating from college, it hindered my ability to get into medical school without issues and she being a pharmacy student, understood my pain and continued being by my side. Eventually, we got back together.

Within the summer of 2010, I got into PA (Physician Assistant) school and my gf at the time graduated from Pharmacy school and became a full-fledge pharmacist at the hospital she interned in. I knew it was going to be difficult to stay together, but I figured if we worked hard and kept in touch, things will be fine.
Eventually, she started to pull away from me due to religious reasons and decided we needed a break. I figured, ""hey, we had a break before, we could still make it work."" Eventually, she became touch-feely with a co-worker who she used to complain about being sexually harassed from when she was an intern. Despite me voicing my concerns, her apologizing and trying to make it up to me with sexy-times (no sex but include all the other facets of love-making, including orgasms on both sides and this being the usual norm for all the years I've known her), she still continued to see the guy and allow him to be touchy-feely. Eventually after two months of this, ending with her kissing that guy voluntarily, I ended it with her for good. Or so I thought.

After an year + of her trying to be my friend and me being weak after being cheated on, things started to get worse. I got kicked out of PA school because, despite my adequate GPA and acceptable demeanor, had health issues and couldn't handle my rotations like other students. Now, my ex refuses to talk or see me because she is now dating a new guy. Despite saying that she can't be serious with me because of my religion, she is dating a white catholic russian (the guy she cheated on me with) or possibly a totally new guy.
I now feel so used and useless, it's unbelievable. She dated a guy in high school for her junior and senior year that she didn't have feelings for, but she gained popularity. She dated a guy in college before me for two months but made him end it because he looked like a guy who cared about his brother more-so than her. She then dated me for the remaining six years of her pharm school because I thought she loved me and wanted us to marry. Now that she's out, she's dating another guy who isn't marriage material, who's prolly gonna get dumped for a guy her parents picked for her.

As much as I loved her and as much as I admit how shitty she treated me, I still feel useless and incomplete. I just don't know what to do anymore and I'm literally hanging on by a thread. Can someone please, please help me? Tell me what I can do to get out of the mess I'm in? I'm taking meds, from MS meds to anti depressants, getting psyciatric therapy, neurologists, ENT docs to fix my nasal septum, everything I can for my physical limitations but I have nobody to go to for my emotional pain. Hell, after my nose surgery and taking percoset a week ago, I became emotionally unstable and confessed my emotions to her (she was still trying to be my friend despite confessing that she has no intentions to see me and wants a texting relationship only). She then adequately squashed any dreams and hope of recovering what we had...brutally...and told me to leaver her alone, after months of me telling her to leave me alone for breaking my heart. I need some serious help and I don't know what to do to stay alive anymore. My MS depression doesn't help either.

TL;DR edition: I'm a 24 M who has been in a long 7 year, on-again-off-again relationship with a pharmacist student/pharmacist. Thought she was the one. Then she cheated on me once school is over. I have MS, failed being a doctor, got kicked out of PA school due to lingering health issues, got cheated on, feeling inadequate and don't know what to live for anymore. I need help please! =("

Breaking Mark Seriff's trade ""SECRET""",flamingspew,programminghorror,https://www.reddit.com/r/programminghorror/comments/y1pxa/anyone_else_ever_develop_for_aol_breaking_mark/,"The year was 1996. I was 14 years old. I had to take a RAINMAN seminar before I could intern at the ""Digital City"" division of media curating for ""Digital City Denver: Arts Soup"" sub-category. Want proof? I was on the cover of Denver Jobs, a printed monthly. OMG an Asian kid with blonde highlights knows how to use a computer! The photographer stood on top of my rickety wooden desk. Fun ensued. 

They will probably sue me now on the basis of some fucked up NDA I signed as a naive minor. Let me remind you lawyers, innocent, manipulable virgin minor with headgear and braces. 

RAINMAN stood for ""Remote Access Information Manager"" but what it really meant was that there was a slow-ass server somewhere that took actual pseudo SMTP messages from a bizarre coding/gui interface (closest thing I can think of is if Dreamweaver were made by the 1992 MS Word team) that ""submitted"" your ""code"" VIA FUCKING EMAIL to be compiled on said shitty-slow pentium i486 in Texas or some shit. 

Ten minutes later you'd get a list of compile errors in your AOL Account Inbox because your ""screen name"" was passed through the shitty in-AOL IDE to the server VIA FUCKING EMAIL! No, really, the only way to code for AOL was to login, click on the ""page"" you wanted to edit, have some manager add you to an access list and fuck up like 5 times because THEY'RE EMAILING A SERVER TO GRANT PRIVILEGES.

How many times do I have to say you compiled your code by EMAILING A FUCKING SERVER! It's a trade secret because patenting that shit would just make you go to prison.

This is what wikipedia says about AOL Rainman: 

Rainman code is kept strictly confidential by AOL; access is granted at their discretion.

BECAUSE IT IS EMBARRASSING, NOT BECAUSE THE TRADE SECRET WILL GET YOU LAID. EMAIL. EMAIL. It's not even code, it's like a parser without a greencard in constant fear of being deported to Borgia.

y1k7n,25,2012-08-11,Alternate Joker/Harley Quinn Storyline,theresabatman,TheDarkKnightRises,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkKnightRises/comments/y1k7n/alternate_jokerharley_quinn_storyline/,"As this film gives the Bruce Wayne/Batman legend a definitive conclusion, the following theory would not have fit into The Dark Knight Rises. In addition, Nolan did state out of respect to Ledger that there would be no mention of the Joker in the trilogies finale. 

However, if Nolan hadn't stated that he was done with the series, and if he wasn't so opposed to never using the Joker character again, I thought of an interesting alternate ending to TDKR.

Near the beginning of the film we are given a more in-depth explanation of the Dent Act and the effects it had on Gotham's prisoners. We see that most have been moved to Blackgate prison with only the Joker being the sole prisoner/patient left in Arkham. The audience is introduced to a team of guards and psychologists who have been left to secure and treat the Joker (all the while he is never seen). Particular focus is given to an intern named Harleen Quinzel who seems particularly impressionable and fascinated by The Clown Prince. 

Throughout the film you see/hear about how shaken she has become after her sessions with the Joker.

As Bane takes over Gotham, she is one of the only staff to stay on and 'secure' the Joker's incarceration whilst an obsession is starting to become more evident.

As the film is winding down and all the plot points are wrapped up, we see a slightly more unhinged Harleen take out the remaining guards as she makes her way to the Joker's cell. You see her hands unlock the door as she says ""Mista J, time to come out and play"". The sound of the Joker's laugh begins as the screen fades to black.

Of course, this was never going to happen. But I thought it would have made a cool addition to TDKR, all the while giving fans a glimpse of the Joker (without taking too much attention away from Bane) and setting up interest in the next film. But alas, it was not meant to be"

The healthcare industry is booming right now and it's expected to grow exponentially over the next few decades. According to government sources, healthcare spending in the U.S. is projected to grow to $4.1 trillion within the next six years and will account for over 20% of the Gross Domestic Product (GPD). A fortunate side-effect of this projection is that the medical industry will also create over $3 million new jobs by 2020, so it's certainly a good time to consider a career as a nurse, medical assistant, or other healthcare professional.

The downside to those statistics is that they are readily accessible. Lots of people are jumping on the bandwagon. And niche healthcare universities are popping up everywhere, making it much easier for the average Joe or Jane to acquire a degree. In the past few years, it has become possible to obtain medical degrees and nursing certifications from accredited online academies and this type of education, in conjunction with clinical internships and preceptorships, has become a popular method of pursuing a career in the field.

So, what we're left with is a growing medical industry with a growing number of employees in the field, all of them with similar educational backgrounds. And if you are one of the many job seekers trying to find a job, you need to find a way to make yourself stand out amongst the pack. Simply put, you need a good resume.

Jobs in healthcare will require you to have a certain background, but they will also require you to be a certain kind of person. Not only must your resume accurately convey your professional potential, it must also reflect your ability to empathize with patients, families, and clinical colleagues. It has to show that you are committed and passionate about quality care and general health education.

Nurses make up the largest percentage of all healthcare workers, thus there is a bit more competition out there. Currently there are over 3 million Registered Nurses (RNs) in the U.S. alone and that's not including Licensed Practical Nurses (LPNs), Licensed Vocational Nurses (LVNs), Certified Nursing Assistants (CNAs), and various other specialized nursing professionals.

Nursing resumes tips are everywhere if you do some searching online, but after reading many of those articles I decided to write my own. I found that the majority of these articles were fairly generic and didn't offer any real insight into the mind of employer. Over the years I have worked with countless hiring managers as a recruiter and have wrote resumes professionally for an online medical university, so I believe I have some valuable information to share with nursing job seeker.

Here are 5 medical resume tips for both entry-level and professional nurses:

Entry-Level Nursing Resume Tips

1) I would suggest laying your resume out from top to bottom as follows: Intro, Education, Internships, Professional Experience, Summary of Qualifications. This is a very logical layout for an entry-level nursing resume. The intro should be a short paragraph or objective statement that briefly summarizes your background. Then you go straight into education because this is what hiring managers are concerned with first and foremost when dealing with entry-level candidates. Next you talk in detail about your internships and then about your professional experience, which you only need to go into detail about if it's relevant. For instance, if you were a cashier you may want to list it, but you don't need to go into the specifics of your responsibilities since they aren't really relevant. Lastly, include a summary section with bullet points outlining your experience. They can be very specific skills or they can be more generalized, like ""Able to communicate effectively with patients, families, and clinical colleagues"". I find this to be a strong way to conclude the resume.

2) If you are an entry-level job seeker, you need to place a lot of focus on your education and training. At the very least, include information on the school or program you attended, the years you attended, and the degree you obtained. You can even go one step further and list the courses you took while pursuing your degree or certification. This will show employers that you completed the necessary curriculum and will also help add some strategic keywords within the context of your resume.

3) Go into detail about your required internships or preceptorships. You should include information regarding the clinical facility you worked in, the dates you worked there, and your daily responsibilities in the position. Don't be afraid to make this the most detailed part of your entry-level resume, especially since your don't have much professional experience in the field to draw from. Talk in detail about the nursing professionals you worked with and the level of patient interactions you had. If you utilized specialized medical equipment, it's a good time to bring that up as well.

4) You don't need to include references in your entry-level nursing resume. If a company, hospital, or hiring manager wants to see references from you they will ask. Typically, reference checks are made later in the hiring process, after a series of interviews, and they will let you know if/when you need to submit a list of references.

5) Don't overdo it. Too many people have a tendency to write a 3 page novel and pass it off as a resume, which is definitely a no-no for an entry-level candidate. The best advice I can give you is keep it short, keep it succinct, and keep it real. After all, you don't want to intimidate a hiring manager by giving them Tolstoy to read. Instead, as with any effective marketing tool, you want to give the reader just enough info to leave them wanting to know more. That's when they call you for an interview and THAT's when you really sell yourself.

Professional Nursing Resume Tips

1) If you are an established professional your resume will look a bit different than someone applying for an entry-level nursing position. First off, I would recommend including a ""Summary of Qualifications"" or ""Areas of Expertise"" section at the very top. I suggest a short introduction or objective statement, and then lead to some bulleted points that highlight your most impressive accomplishments in the industry. This is a great opportunity to cram in some strategic keywords that will help you be noticed in HR software applications. You can use keywords that are found in the job description for the job you plan to apply for, or use more generalized terms like ""Medical Terminology"", ""Patient Relations"", etc.

2) Do not go into too much detail about your education, especially if it's a bit outdated. You should include ALL of your education and training, but you really don't need to go into detail unless it is very relevant and recent. If you just took a specialized course in phlebotomy, by all means mention that as one of your strengths. But the main focus should be on your clinical and practical experience in the field because that's what employers really want to see.

3) Make sure you mention your level of interaction with patients. Most nursing are very patient-oriented so it's important for you to include information regarding the types of patients you've worked with in various clinical settings.

4) You don't need to include references in your professional nursing resume. If a company, hospital, or hiring manager wants to see references from you they will ask. Typically, reference checks are made later in the hiring process, after a series of interviews, and they will let you know if/when you need to submit a list of reference.

5) Don't overdo it. Too many people have a tendency to write a 3 page novel and pass it off as a resume. The best advice I can give you is keep it short, keep it succinct, and keep it real. After all, you don't want to intimidate a hiring manager by giving them Tolstoy to read. Instead, as with any effective marketing tool, you want to give the reader just enough info to leave them wanting to know more. That's when they call you for an interview and THAT's when you really sell yourself.

y40m0,2,2012-08-12,"[24/M] I have feeling for my ex-gf (23/F) and she has feelings for me. Chances of going back together are small for practical reasons. I want to tell her I miss her and talk about it, should I ?",n0ggy,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/y40m0/24m_i_have_feeling_for_my_exgf_23f_and_she_has/,"I have [posted this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/y3uoh/women_how_would_you_feel_if_an_exboyfriend_that/) is /r/askwomen as well, but I realized I needed as much opinions as possible, and from men as well.

Okay, I'll try to keep this as short as possible,. Or at least include a TL;DR.

Been in a relationship with a girl, for about 1,5 year. I'm 24. This relationship was divided in two because she went for 6 months in China for an internship and a possible job opportunity afterwards.

We decided to end the relationship (at the 7 months mark) because :

* She already went to China the year before for 3 months and her ex-boyfriend cheated on her, which really destroyed her. She couldn't deal with that risk again.
* She wasn't sure she would even be back, and none of us were ready to take a vow of chastity of 6 months if we weren't sure we would see each other again.

The beginning was really hard. (Her calling me crying telling me she loved me and me trying to find the balance between comforting her and not giving her false hopes). But we kept in touch through mails, talking about our lives and trying to communicate as if we were just close friends.

I started dating again after two months, and from what I assumed, so did she. However, we both didn't have serious relationships and it was usually one night stands and summer-loves. 

Time went by, her internship ended, and she got back to France (We're both French) waiting for a confirmation for her job opportunity in China. We met up for a drink, talking on the phone as if it was a ""friends who see each other after a long time"". We were completely fooling ourselves and we were having sex a few hours later. 

She told me that we would have to live the same thing about her China trip again because her job offer was confirmed even though she had to wait another 7-8 months before going back there. And that this time it wouldn't be a 6 months thing, but at LEAST a 1,5-2 year thing. Meaning a genuine break-up. We knew we would hate it, but we were still in love and we got back together.

We lived the second part of our relationship. It was as great as the first part but we ended up reaching the ultimatum. Second time I had to deal with breaking-up with someone I was still in love with. I swallowed my tears and we bid each other goodbye. 

It has been 5 months and a half now. We are still in touch through mail (talking like close friends again) on a monthly basis. And being a guy, even though I try to deny it, I'm still in love with her and I miss her terribly. I had relationships during these five months, enough girls not to put the blame on loneliness or desperation. I just haven't found someone nearly as great as her.

I refrained myself from sharing my feelings with her (seeing it as being pointless and making her feel uncomfortable). Also, being still friends with her on Facebook and having a glimpse of her life, I've noticed she found a new boyfriend about a month and half ago. Something that seemed serious. I was both very happy for her and terribly sad at the same time.

About a week ago, I saw a bunch of disturbing message on her facebook wall. (I know, I know, kind of immature to get worked up about facebook stuff) (You just have to know that she's the kind of girl who uses quotes/lyrics/songs/hints on facebook to talk about her problems, and that she do it very rarely. She's not very active on facebook. It must be REALLY strong feeling if she does that.) :

* First message : ""i'm having a bad, bad day, Despicable you"". Huh, maybe a bad day with a client, though it's not her type talking about her work on facebook. Looks like something wrong with her bf.
* Second message : Thought about my new favorite quote from Notting Hill : ""-Max? - Absolutely, never trust a vegetarian"" with one of her friend adding ""a MALE vegetarian !"". I don't know about her bf diet but looks pretty clear that she ended the relationship, and the guy isn't in her friend list anymore.
* Third message : (And this is the one who got me all worked up). ""No man is worth your tears, and the only one who is, will never make you cry."" And the only people who liked the publication were friends who only knew her when she was with me. Which leads me to think that she's might be talking about me.

Now, for the last three days I'm constantly thinking about her and I'm one stupid decision away from telling her ""Is it a stupid decision to tell you that I still miss you... ?"". I know she still has strong feelings for me, I know that she won't always be in China and that she'll be back eventually, but she won't be back this year at least. (That's why I was talking about ""slim chances"" in the title).

But still, I'm terrified to share my feelings. I'm afraid she will feel like shit. I'm afraid it will make me look like a wimp. I'm afraid it will only twist the knife in the wound. But nevertheless, it's eating me from inside. It's been months I want to talk to her about it, and now I think about it every time. How would YOU react ? What should I do ?

**TL;DR : I'm sorry it's actually annoyingly long. Been in a great relationship with a girl for 1,5 years. We were in love. (Possibly still ?). Ended the relationship because she got a job offer in China. I can observe through Facebook &amp; mails that we both haven't moved on (even though we both had relationships since the break up). I want to tell her I miss her and talk to her. Should I ? How would you react ?**

I've seen numerous ads on craiglist, padmapper and co. But I'm not able to visit Toronto before my internship, hence I could not meet the roommates in person.

y3ons,24,2012-08-12,"[23/m] my girlfriend (20/f) of 1.75yrs really freaked me out after a phone call today, need some help",subtle-knife,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/y3ons/23m_my_girlfriend_20f_of_175yrs_really_freaked_me/,"Background:

Met in college and dated for about 1.5 years and then got an apartment together. This summer I received an internship that is took me outside of the city and now we are about an 8 hour drive apart. So she is living in the apartment alone for the summer. We have seen each other 3 times this summer (2 weekends and she came with me on my family vacation 5 days). I am a senior in college and she is a junior and after she finishes her undergrad she wants to go to grad school at a new school. So she will be in school almost 3 years after im done.

Problem:

So she just got back from a week long vacation with her parents and close family friend (28/f). We finally had a talk on the phone and she started pulling out all of this stuff about having lots of time to think this summer and that her perceptions of who she wants to be have changed. She then goes on to tell me that I cant make decisions about my future based off of her. After talking to her I just straight up ask her if she doesnt think we are going to be compatible together anymore (i.e. are you breaking up with me over the phone). She replies in the negative, which I can believe.

My problem is that this has come out of nowhere. I mean, we have done so well together and this summer seemed like it was going very well. But now this coming out of nowhere is messing with my head. I am more than happy to get a job for a year in the city we go to school in and then move to wherever she goes to grad school. Really, no problem with that at all. I feel that we are a good match and we equalize each other (she tempers my impulsiveness and I make her a little more outgoing) and I will go out of my way to keep this good thing going. but she thinks that me following her around isn't a good move and wants my to make my decisions based off what is best for me... Cant being with her be what is best for me? I think the last thing that she said is that we shouldnt look at it as if we are running together, but parallel. So that if she decides to turn down a path I dont want to then we can go on our own.


Solution:

Anyway, I could really use some advice for when i talk to her later tonight. I asked her to tell me what kind of perception she has for her future so I can get an idea of what she wants to change about herself. Thanks in advance for the advice!


Result:

Talked to her, found out that all the things that she is looking at is making changes to better herself (healthier and more active) and being more independent. She felt like she boxed herself into a stay at home kind of person and being at home alone alot this summer has made her realize that she wants to go out and experience new things (thank goodness we are on the same page here). I just basicly said im up for an adventure, and even if our travels through life take us different places i dont think there is any way ill regret the journey."
y3bas,2,2012-08-12,Can anyone help me with figuring out PA/NY intern licensing?,veggietales,pharmacy,https://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/y3bas/can_anyone_help_me_with_figuring_out_pany_intern/,"So I'm attending pharmacy school in PA (just finished my P1 year) and I have an internship at a chain pharmacy in NY, but I'll be working at the same chain during the school year in PA this year. I have licenses in both states, the one in PA has my professor as my preceptor because I didn't previously have an internship there, so I'm going to add my new preceptor from work onto my PA license.

My questions are mainly with the NY license and making sure my hours count. I found [this form 4](http://www.op.nysed.gov/prof/pharm/pharmforms.htm) on the NYS website that my friend who graduated a few years ago (in the same situation as me) filled out, but under the description, it says that it's not required for graduates of ACPE/CCAPP programs, which mine is.
It also says on another page:
&gt; A separate Form 4 is required for each time period, for each pharmacy, and for each preceptor and should be completed, signed by both intern and preceptor, and returned to the Department at the address on the form 

The form requires both the intern and the preceptor pharmacist to sign and get notarized, along with recording the intern hours. My problem is that it's hard to get anyone to sign as my preceptor in NY because I work with a different pharmacist almost every time, my ""home"" store basically shuns me, and the pharmacist that hired me has been transferred. My friends that go to school in NYS have never heard of this form, although one person said that's because the form is for out-of-state people (but the website says nothing like that). My school hasn't been too helpful, I'm going to try them again but the last time I had a question about NY they had no idea.

SO if any of you have any ideas about if I need this form or not, if I need about 10 pharmacists to sign 10 different forms, or if there's something else I need to do, I would greatly appreciate it before I go crazy."

Where to start? my guess is probability, but open to recommendations.",[deleted],learnmath,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/y2yen/computer_engineering_undergrad_behind_and_wants/,"A lot of courses which will apply to my masters degree (Computer Engineering with a concentration in intelligent systems) require an understanding of Probability. I have put off taking this class due to schedule constraints, but I feel like I am behind and want to pick up on some probability before the spring when I will be taking the course. I feel like knowing some probability/statistics will help me out in my next semester of internship, and gently introduce me to a subject of math I've never explored nor understood. I enjoyed calculus 1-4 and doing simple proofs in discrete mathematics, but other than that, my exposure to probability and statistics have been little.

It seems to me like there is little to like about probability in its initial stages, but my boyfriend did his masters in mathematics and probability is so fundamental in so many of his subjects. I would like one day to achieve a masters in Mathematics as well, but I'd like to do so slowly and after I pay off my current college debts.

I'm taking a class on Linear Systems next semester and although I am terrified since it is my first level 600 course, I am excited and up for the challenge. But I was just curious as to what I could do to begin preparing myself for more complex math problems which I would like to apply to my school projects. For example, Markov chains I've heard a lot about, but know very little about them, and I probably lack the fundamental concepts needed to understand them.

Where can I start? Books recommendations with problems are appreciated. I won't have much time to watch video lectures, so it would be nice if I could read some text on the matter and then solve problems. Free Texts would be nice as this is something I'd like to do in my spare time, instead of browsing reddit...

His family brought him and his five siblings to California and he has been living here since. He was a straight A student all the way through high school and speaks almost perfect English. He was able to get a college degree in economics in three and a half years without receiving any financial aid. He is now completing an MS degree in mechanical engineering. He is a very hard working and honest person. Until now his prospects were very bleak because despite of his degrees he was never going to be able to work in the United States as an engineer. The only jobs he has been able to do are waiting tables and fast food, where a fake SS number is all you need. So his plan was moving to Canada after graduation, which would mean leaving his family and friends and everything that he knows. Obama's policy is allowing him to apply for a social security number and do his first internship at an engineering firm in the Bay Area. This is making his dream come true and everything he has worked so hard for has now become achievable. I think we should focus a lot more on all the good things that Obama has done and is trying to do for all of us. He can make a huge difference for our country and determine where we are headed to as a society."
y63q7,31,2012-08-13,"Depression, Sleep Ruining My Chances of Becoming a Doctor?",AfraidOfInternship,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/y63q7/depression_sleep_ruining_my_chances_of_becoming_a/,"I’m not really sure what to do with myself. I am currently a fourth year medical student who should be getting my application ready to apply for residencies. Instead, I find myself languishing the days away in bed or in front of my computer. Throughout all of medical school, I have been struggling with major depression on top of a sleep disorder, and that has been difficult enough. But there are also weeks at a time, that occur every so often, when symptoms are more pronounced, and it becomes arduous and exhausting to even arrive on time at my clinical sites.

Currently, I am on my anesthesia rotation. This is an important rotation for me, because anesthesia is what I hope to do.  However, due to these problems, I’ve missed quite a number of days. I was hoping to use this as an opportunity to get some letters of recommendation, but I’ve squandered it. 

So not only do I feel like I have screwed myself over even as far as applications go, but I have also become really worried about the prospect of intern year. I know that it will be very demanding, and it will be impossible for me to fulfill those responsibilities it at this rate.

I’ve talked with student affairs in the past; they seem mostly interested in confirming that I am not suicidal (I’m not) and then refer me to a psychiatrist. I’ve been seeing a psychiatrist for 2 years now, and various medications have not really brought about much change in any of my symptoms yet. So I am not sure where else to turn. The idea of taking time off has been suggested, but since I need to be using this time to apply for residencies, this may be the worst possible time to take a leave of absence. Additionally, I’m not sure what taking time off would accomplish.

I guess my questions are: Is it impossible for me to be or even become a doctor? Have I kissed my chances at having an acceptable application goodbye? Has anyone else dealt with major depression or sleep disorders through medical school? How did they challenge you, and what helped you?

EDIT: I want to thank everyone for their advice and concern, and I want to apologize for not responding sooner. I was able to talk with student affairs and the anesthesia clerkship director; I have moved some rotations around in my schedule to allow for some time off without having to take an actual medical leave (but the option is there should I need it). Additionally, I was offered some make-up dates for anesthesia, and the clerkship director is keeping these issues between us. I have to say, everything has worked out better than I thought it would. I was surprised at the understanding that everyone showed. Still, I have to focus on getting better--I've agreed to meet with a therapist on a regular basis (something I'd not been doing before) and I have a new appointment with a psychiatrist to adjust my meds.

Again, thanks for all your support.

y5ta6,5,2012-08-13,"Ents, I'm having a really shitty summer...",[deleted],trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/y5ta6/ents_im_having_a_really_shitty_summer/,"Pretty much as the title says... I really need to vent right now so if you'll put up with me and listen to my LONG story, I'd really appreciate it.

This is the first time I've been back home from school for longer than 2 weeks since I've left. I live in California but I go to school in Indiana, so naturally it's been difficult reconnecting with friends I haven't seen for almost 3 years now. I came back for an internship and overall it seemed like it would be a great summer spending time under the Cali sun and smoking the medical herbs, but it wouldn't last very long.

The first sign of shit going downhill started when my workout buddy dropped a weight on my phone, cracking the screen and rendering it unusable. In retrospect, I shouldn't have had it lying on the floor, but I reacted badly and vented on Facebook over how my ""friend"" now owes me $140 for repair costs. He responds saying he doesn't have the money to spend on that and essentially told me to go fuck myself. I discussed the issue with him further and accepted that, yes, it is partially my fault, and I asked him for half of it: $70. Still, that was too much money for a guy, with a poor single mom who doesn't give him any money, to pay. He goes on further to say how I've been so rude to him for never thanking him for the time he takes out of his day to help me work out and get stronger because he lives 30 minutes away and gas money isn't very cheap these days. To continue rubbing salt in my wounds, he also tells me that I've generally been an asshole lately and a punk for calling him out in public. Eventually, I decided that life was too short to be making enemies out of friends so I reconciled and apologized to him for reacting badly and for being such a terrible person. Being that I take my health very seriously, I asked if he would be willing to continue training me and continue to be my friend. He says he would be willing to, and so I thought that conflict was done. However, weeks go by and my texts about when we could hang out or workout are either ignored or replied with an excuse on how it was his rest day or he had already worked out. I find out later that he's been telling our mutual friends that I'm a shady motherfucker and it's all MY fault that my phone was broken. Okay then, whatever, I'll let that go.

Moving on, I'm chilling with several smoking buddies in my car. My friend in the passenger seat is hitting the bong, but burns himself picking up the bowl and drops it. A decent sized cherry falls out and burns through the car seat. There's no way to clean it, only cover it. My friend assures me that he won't be like the shady bastard who broke my phone and he'll pay for damages. I bought a car seat cover the next day for $75 and inform my friend. He tells me he'll pay me at the end of the month (by which time I will be back in Indiana) when he gets money. He has money now, and I've asked him about if I'll ever see any of it and he assures me I will, but I still haven't gotten any of it yet. This is a homie of mine that I've driven everywhere, bought him cigarettes, smoked him out on numerous occasions, and have generally chilled with for what would've been a very boring summer. I hope that he will remember all that and pay his dues.

Somewhere between these incidents, I was pulled over by a cop with the previously mentioned homie. He didn't tell me why he pulled me over and proceeded to ask questions about what I was up to. He then asked me if I had weed in the car. Being that I had a medical card, I replied honestly and told him I did. Then, I was told to get out of the car and both my friend and I were patted down and my car was searched. The time spent in the back of the police car was one of the worst as the cop searched our names in the database and informed me how California doesn't recognize medical cards as legitimate. Eventually, he lets us go without any charges, despite finding the weed, a bong, and a scale. Needless to say, we were very lucky.

Today, I got a phone call from one of my roommates back in Indiana. He came back and found the carpet drenched and flooded in our apartment. I had let another friend of mine stay in my room free of charge while I was in Cali and before he left for the summer, he left the window in my room open. Indiana gets heavy rainfall during the summertime, and with no one minding the place for about two months, the carpet in the entire place is ruined. Being that my room was the cause, all of my personal belongings are most likely drenched and ruined. The landlord is fairly pissed and will be charging us two months worth of rent.

All this, and I wonder if maybe I had been a terrible person in a past life somewhere. I try my best to be there for my friends; giving them rides, smoking them out, killing time with them, and paying for food. I'm a quiet, reserved guy who treasures his friends as family and would do whatever I can to help out in times of need or boredom. But all my life, I've felt like people walk all over me and take my kindness and quietness for granted. I try to think over my life and see if somewhere, somehow I had done something wrong to deserve all this.

Worst of all, I have a drug test tomorrow (most likely saliva testing) and can't even smoke trees to cheer myself up. So, to all you guys out there, thanks for reading this extremely long post and please smoke one up for me. I know things will get better and all this shit will be behind me eventually, but right now I'm feeling depressed, angry, and just downright shitty.

Peace."

y4vm3,2,2012-08-13,I feel completely lost in life...,Owen_Y,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/y4vm3/i_feel_completely_lost_in_life/,"I'll try to be brief here.

Since I was 17, I've suffered from bad social anxiety and depression, and I can't remember the last time I've felt real drive and motivation to do anything other that play a certain MMO (online game).

I decided to go to college right out of high school because that just seemed like the thing to do, but I've had extreme difficulty and anxiety with planning anything at all in the past three years.

I had the grades and test scores in high school to go to just about any school I wanted to, but as I had no plans or goals, I went to community college instead and spent two years getting an Associate's Degree in nothing (Psychology).

I decided to take out a student loan and go to state university to major in Psychology. I spent a year there, and I now not only hate Psychology, but I see that I have no career prospects in it. I was also rejected from five different research internships (which are needed for graduate school), probably due to my awkwardness. If I waste my money and go back for another year to get the degree, my employment prospects will be the same as they would without the degree.

All summer long, I've been putting off making any decisions about college, putting off finding another job, and overall just being a stupid **** by sleeping and playing video games excessively.

I just don't see any future for myself, but I don't think that suicide is the answer. I don't want to be a leech on my parents, and I want to get out of this town that I wasted the good years of my life in.

I just don't know what to do now, and I'd appreciate any advice."

y4ppu,6,2012-08-13,[Help] Anxiety is getting worse and worse,humB,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/y4ppu/help_anxiety_is_getting_worse_and_worse/,"I am 22 and was diagnosed with GAD around 16, and have been on and off medication, mostly off for the last few years. 

I can generally manage my anxiety to the extent that it only minimally interferes with my life, but over this summer it has gotten increasingly worse. It has been an abnormally stressful time for me, this summer I flew for the first time in about a year (a huge phobia of mine), and have been taking field courses all summer without a break. This meant that I was constantly being asked to do new things, many of which are really emotionally loaded or stressful (visit jails, research the lives of people on death row, research prison abuses, speak out at public meetings where the majority of attendees are hostile to my position), and DO new things that I had no experience with, and consequently, make mistakes, which makes me feel so anxious and like the dumbest person on earth. 

In addition to this, I have recently become a caregiver for my dying grandmother. This is stressful itself, but I am doing it while trying to navigate an internship and study for the LSAT. It also has been really really triggering because I took care of my dad while he died when I was seventeen. And in two weeks, I leave to TA a field course along the border for a month -- not exactly a low stress environment. 

My anxiety is manifesting in its usual ways (upset stomach, picking at my skin, trouble sleeping, sweating and shaking) but also in more and more frequent panic attacks about things like the places we are staying not having a carbon monoxide detector, dying in my sleep, gas leaks, and getting in trouble with the police. (I've quit driving at night because I was having panic attacks after recently being pulled over)

I'm sorry I wrote all that. I guess I just really need advice about what I can do to control my anxiety while I am TAing this class on the border. It's like, the anti-calm. Picture spending most of your day in the worlds most dangerous van with 12 other people learning about horrible atrocities in 101 degree weather. 

How do I navigate trying to control my anxiety without embarrassing myself? which is mostly what I am scared of. It's not like I can discretely buy and carry around a carbon monoxide detector... (I know this is impossible because I have tried.) :(

As I mentioned in the thread before, my partner started hormones this summer while I was away at an internship. I'm finally coming back up to move back in with her tomorrow, and I'm slightly freaking out. I missed her a ton, but we had limited communication for these months, she became pretty asexual (which is pretty difficult because I'm pretty sexual and horny 24/7, [had a thread about that here](http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/x1nql/girlfriend_lost_sex_frive_after_starting_on/) (I know, I come to y'all with all my problems!) but she has recently had some pretty awful anxiety and depression.

Here's why I'm freaking out.

I'm very clingy, I do my best to give space and let her vent, ignore me for days, ect. but I really worry about whether she's upset with me, whether she wants to see me, whether me moving in will raise her anxiety or what.

My ex had some pretty serious mental issues. When I finally broke it off they attempted suicide. Although rationally I realize it wasn't my fault and it was the build up of many problems I'm still not over the feeling of guilt, and at the same time I'm freaked out that I'm getting into another relationship where I'm going to have to babysit/nurse someone. I don't want that. I love my girlfriend and we have such a healthy relationship and if it turns south in this way I just don't know whether I could handle it (previous relationship was three years).

I guess I just need some positivity right now. She says she's excited to see me but she doesn't reply to my texts and ignores my calls because she doesn't want to talk or is in a depressive or anxious mood. And I worry irrationally. I know deep down I'll get there and things will be a lot better. But the combination of worrying about her reaction to me, my raging libido which I am making sure to not spring out on her (because there is no WAY in hell I wanna coerce her into sex, that is abusive) and just general feels I'm kind of freaking out. And need hugs. :(

I got a call from my father about 30 minutes ago. He got really angry and upset at me for posting atheist and pro-equality posts on facebook.
Before I go on, let me explain. I sometimes like a few links that I find witty relating to atheism or gay marriage, that I agree with. I also post links that I feel need to be shown, like for example, how Chik-Fil-A donated to hate groups, or things like that. So, yes, I do post things related to my views.
Anyways, my father got really mad at me for that. He blew up on me on the phone, and said that if I continued this behavior, I would not be able to get good jobs and internships, due to the fact that maybe potential employers will not agree with what I post on facebook. I tried arguing against him about this, and said that personal beliefs should not factor into your professional opinion of a potential employee. However, he still got quite angry at me, and basically made me delete all my links relating to my views on facebook.
I don't know how to tell him I'm a little upset at his actions and words. He actually said a few upsetting things about what I did. He sarcastically called me a ""crusader for the LGBT group"" and how my actions will not affect anything anyway.
Well, perhaps I will not affect anything, but I still want my friends to know the atrocities sometimes committed when people go too far.
So, /r/atheism, I ask you... was I wrong to argue against my dad? I love him and I know he loves me, but I don't think he is being really fair about this.
What should I say to him? Please help."

(Or: How I Found Myself Smoking in a Ghetto in the Heart of Beijing),Jaxx2112,PipeTobacco,https://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/comments/y47xn/my_entry_to_the_challenge_of_the_week_the_old_man/,"This has been pretty requested story and so I found it fitting to tell it now, what with the podcast challenge this week. I won’t delay any longer, so without further ado-- The Old Chinese Man and His Pipe.

.

Some of you, through IRC, Pipe N Skype, or passing, know that in 2011, I spent just shy of 9 months working in China.  I was finishing up my undergraduate degree at Northeastern University in Boston and decided I was going to spend my 3rd cooperative experience (kinda like a paid internship) abroad.  I ended up working for a contract manufacturer in southwest China about an hour outside of Shenzhen in a small town outside of the city of Dongguan in the Guangdong province.  During this time I took a vacation to Japan and felt that on the way back I should stop off and see Beijing.  It was a few months from the end of my coop, I had done traveling in southwest China earlier and didn’t feel like i’d have an issue traveling alone.  (For reference, i’m a 6’7’’ white male, so most people were more likely to ask for a photo than to rob me.)

.

So during my stay in Beijing, I decided that one of the places I had to check out were the Hutongs.  The Hutongs are low rent areas that are split into residential and marketplaces.   The marketplaces are infamous and quite cool, with some streets being so narrow that two people can’t even walk side by side.  While searching for the marketplace Hutongs I found myself wandering into the residential neighborhood without realizing it.  Rather soon I found myself smack dab in the middle of the Beijing residential hutong, where [holes in concrete walls were patched with pieces of wooden doors, the rooftops were waterproofed with tarp and cinder blocks, and life was rather dismal](http://imgur.com/a/hckTm).  Full families lived here while their children worked to provide food for them or go to the Beijing universities to hopefully branch out and find a better life.  

.

At this time, right about when I realized that I was probably not supposed to be in this area, I saw something familiar, something I hadn’t seen my entire time in China.  It was a pipe smoker.  He was an old man, who couldn’t have been any younger than 75, shirtless (mind you it was July) and sitting on an empty milk crate nursing an basket pipe past its prime.  It was held together with black electrical tape wrapped a quarter of an inch thick along the shank and stem, likely from a crack tenon at some point, and was clinging on its last legs.  But this didn’t stop the old man, he just sat there, puffing away.  When I saw him, my heart lept.  Without thinking I hoisted my rucksack over my shoulder and retrieved a small rectangular box.  It was my [Savinelli Piazza](http://imgur.com/a/9ntQH), a pipe I had bought 3 months prior to commemerate my life in China.  I showed it to him and tried to speak broken Mandarin, but without success.  Once I realized the err of my ways, I simply pointed at his pipe, at him and then at my pipe and myself, as if to say “Hey buddy!  We both do this!”.  He looked at me, looked at my pipe, and smiled a crooked grin with his crooked teeth.  

.

He retrieved a haggard aluminum tin from his side, with what must have been the driest tobacco i’d ever seen. I could only guess it was some RYO virginia.  He pushed it towards me, as if to offer me some.  I was hesitant to say the least.  I decided “Fuck it, i’ll have a quarter of a bowl.”  Nope!  He saw me gingerly put in a small amount and then decided he was going to help me.  He took a heavy pinch, wadded it up and jammed it into my pipe with his thumb while i was holding it.  I reached for my lighter, but before I could take it out, he produced a broken red bic with a crack pipe flame coming out of it.  I took a few puffs and found out that my previous guess was certainly correct. It wasn’t the most pleasurable smoke, but it burned quick, a little hot, didn’t bite, and for those of you who enjoy tobacco reviews-- it even burned to a fine white ash.

.

He offered his crate to me and I declined, choosing to sit on the dust covered street.  We tried to talk, him in simple mandarin, me in exceptionally broken as fuck mandarin.  We didn’t get too far.  He tried to ask me where I came from, I told him the USA.  He asked me a few other questions I didn’t understand, but if I had to guess, he was asking me why i was here, or what brought me to China.  In the end it didn’t really matter.  We sat there, puffing in silence and simply enjoyed each others company.  As I finished up my bowl I took out a tin of Nightcap and offered it to him, but he had already refilled his bowl while I was smoking and refused.  I tried again to give him the tin, but he wouldn’t have it.  In the end, someone i assume was his son compromised and rolled one using my nightcap.  I didn’t have the heart to try and stop him--it was obvious they were trying to be polite and wouldn’t take no for an answer.  Well... needless to say, he didn’t like it, he coughed a bit and pointed to my tin and said “bu hao”--“Not Good”. I shrugged it off and now he probably thinks that all American’s inhale English blends in RYO cigs.  After a few more minutes, I asked/gestured for a photograph and then respected his wishes when he declined.  In hindsight I wish I had gotten a picture of the pipe and especially one of us, the remarkable pair from two worlds who shared a bowl while sitting on the dirty streets of Beijing, with nothin’ in common but the leaf."
y7yl6,7,2012-08-14,I need away from everything,AMadThrowaway,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/y7yl6/i_need_away_from_everything/,"This summer I worked an internship at a place back home, and all I did was sit in an office. I never saw the sun, I never got to walk around, I was in an enclosed office with a shitty monitor, IE7, and Reddit. At first it was great, I got to browse and learn all I wanted about math that I couldn’t do during the school year. Then I got fed up with the internet, I wanted something to do. I’ve done nothing at work, 40 hours a week, for the whole fucking summer. I’m never happy, I’m fucking cold because the A/C is turned up, I’m always getting irritable, it’s depressing. I didn’t accomplish anything. I didn’t make the company better. I didn’t learn shit. I don’t have anything to talk to new job recruiters about this year. I have to stress that every day felt like it was raining outside; right now, I know it’s sunny, but it feels like I should walk to a window and see gray skies and rain.

My officemate is a devout, close-minded, babbling liberal who can’t think. All he’s done is bash religion, conservatives, and my home town all summer while talking about how great his girlfriend is, how he treats her really well for the REwards as if everything he does is an investment in sexual favors. He decided he wants to propose to her next year, and he tells me how I should treat my girlfriend. At first his advice was a little welcome, but now it’s just annoying. I have no desire to treat my girlfriend like a perfect fucking fairytale princess because that’s not how I am, and that’s not what either of us would want. 

My friends are all either off on internships, working shitty overnight jobs, or off doing military things. Everyone has changed from how they used to be, and it’s understandable. We grew up, we’re not in high school anymore. But I miss all my friends. They’re the only way I could keep myself entertained in this shithole town, and now that I don’t have them, I just sit in my house and read or try to be productive. But I’m not happy. There’s nothing for me in this town, there’s no friends, no fun, no happiness. 

My family seems entirely different from when I left for school. It’s probably just my eyes opening, but everything seems worse. My mom tries to offer advice about things she has no idea on, my dad seems to be an intolerant right-wing asshole (as opposed to level headed and open for discussion), and my little brother is stuck up his girlfriend’s ass, never home, and acts like he gives zero fucks about the rest of us. And my parents let him walk all over and have no responsibility.

My girlfriend got on a kick of wanting to be engaged in the next year to year and a half. I’m 19, she’s 20. She keeps talking about how we need to move in together, half joking, but I get the feeling she isn’t joking, and it’s all just her trying to get some footing so if I finally agree to it jokingly, she can pounce and suggest we live together. She won’t stop pestering me about marriage. She says she’s not trying to pressure me, then she goes off about how all the people she knows are getting engaged and how it makes her jealous. 

And she bitches. My girlfriend will bitch about anything. I mentioned her complaining about some simple thing, and my father made the comment that, “She just doesn’t seem like someone who would be happy no matter what.” And the more I look at it, the more right he appears. Nothing I do can make her happy, she just smiles a lot for a little while and then she wants more. At first she thought everything would be better when we both went to school near each other, but then she started being a bitch again. So then she starts in on the moving in together, or the marriage, so that way everything would be better, just like she said before.

And all the politics going on right now (American). I can’t take it. I’m tired of being around my dad turning on the news and bitching about Obama, but leaving it on the station. I’m tired of people around me acting like they know what’s going on and bashing Romney and blindly supporting Obama. No one knows what’s going on, and I don’t want to fake it like everyone else. 

My officemate also introduced the idea of “determinism” to me. This last month I’ve been struggling with this idea. It bugs me. That my entire life has already been determined. I realized I’m nothing but an ongoing chemical reaction. There’s no choice. There’s only external influence and nerves firing as they’re stimulated. Thinking isn’t real. Nothing is real. Given enough (infinite) information, I could be completely simulated in a computer if it had to be done. It all seems so fucking pointless.

I just want the fuck away from everyone. I just want to go back to classes and learn. I want to think. I want to actually be productive. I want to study and be left alone to do what I enjoy: thinking. I just want to go live in the middle of the woods with a case of beer and subsist. I want nothing to do with anyone or anything. I don’t want a TV. I don’t want Facebook. I don’t want people talking to me. I just want to go out and be alone.  

**TL;DR**: I can't stand being around anyone anymore. I hate where I am, I just want to be left alone to do what I want and not put up with other people.

**Edit:**If anyone has anything they could suggest, or anything to talk about, or something, I would appreciate it.

But we want to do a video with a similar ""feel"" as the ""We Stopped Dreaming"" videos (props to the creator, if you're out there, send me a message!) but directed towards a younger audience. Of course, any pointers are appreciated, pro or con!"

And maybe a little reasoning on why?  Do you think it's possible to balance it all?  Are you hopeful or does your personal timeline of desired events scare you?

I'm just really curious on what motivates different women.


**Edit:** Guess it's only fair if I post my status and goals too...

24, in a new-ish relationship, no kids, and hold a B.A. from a good school.  Currently employed with 2 years of experience in a field I really like, though I've job hopped a bit more than I would have liked (within the same field except for a 4-month internship that was tangentially related).

For me, 30 is a milestone where I'd like to be making about double what I make now, and I'd like to at least be thinking about kids (and that's mainly because of the health risks that start kicking in around 35).  35 would be the latest I would willingly have a kid. I do want to get married someday, but I want to be DINKs before children come along.

Currently my motivations are just my job and having fun dating and making friends in the city I moved to.  I don't really feel pressure on the settling down front as I feel I have time.

y6re0,2,2012-08-14,I'm afraid my sketchy past is going to interfere with this relationship... should I tell him?,merferr,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/y6re0/im_afraid_my_sketchy_past_is_going_to_interfere/,"Okay, so I've known Mark since I was 16 and he was around 20 at work. I was a low level mail girl and he was an accounting intern of some sort. Obviously I was too young to date him, but we found that we had a LOT in common and have remained friends over the years. 

Sadly, I went through a lot in my teenage years, including a very abusive relationship when I was 15-17. My immediate manager's name was Kyle and he was 28. One day at work he asked about a bruise and I broke down and told him. He helped me call the police on my boyfriend and was a lot of helping in getting over the situation.

But Kyle isn't--and wasn't--a good man. I trusted him a lot, and one night he was helping me finish some work up. He ended up kissing me and, honestly, I kissed him back. I trusted him, and thought that he probably just really liked me despite our age gap. He wanted to have sex but I was still a virgin and embarrassed so I told him no. 

We still made out a lot, and I thought he actually liked me and we just had to keep it a secret because i was underage. At one point I was considering sleeping with him, until one day someone mentioned that he had a girlfriend... of four years. 

I was completely devastated and horrified at what I'd done, and left town to attend college in a different city. I returned over the summers, and Mark and I continued to hang out as friends. At the beginning of this summer, however, we were hanging out with some of his friends, and I'd spilled a drink on my skirt so he showed me where the kitchen was; while we were in there he admitted that he was in love with me (this was no surprise to anybody). I'd always seen him as too old for me, but he said that it had been a few years coming but he never wanted to seem creepy. He told me he would understand if I didn't feel the same way, but I decided that I trusted him more than anybody I'd ever known. So we gave it a shot.

So far, it's been more than perfect. He ended up being the first person I slept with, and it was really amazing. He's sweet and caring, and we have a lot of really amazing sex. 

the problem is: he's in a friend circle that includes Kyle! And I've seen Kyle when we've been out and about, and he's basically been threatening to tell Mark about what I did when I worked for him. I know Mark hates cheating and I'm afraid he'll break up with me if he found out that Kyle had cheated on his girlfriend with me. I feel like I should just tell him so that Kyle can't hold it over my head any longer, but i'm so scared. Even though I might not be in 'love' with Mark, I don't know what I'd do if he broke up with me because of a bad decision I made years ago. Do you have any advice for me?

**TL;DR** I hooked up with an older guy that had a girlfriend when I was 17, and I'm afraid that my current, perfect boyfriend will dump me if he finds out :( should I just man up and tell him??

**Edit:** okay, I'm going to tell him tonight. We're supposed to meet a bunch of people for drinks and Kyle's supposed to be there, so I want to get this over with as soon as I can"

Please help me.",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/y6qpe/22m_i_have_been_dating_my_girlfriend_21f_for_8/,"Me and my girlfriend have been dating for 8 years now, and she is absolutely the love of my life. Here's some background info. We began dating right before freshman year of highschool, and have continued ever since. In college we were in a constant long-distance relationship, which put a lot of strain on our relationship, but I just graduated and she will be graduating next month. I should note that I majored in audio production, which is extremely difficult to find a job in.

She took an internship at a hospital down in the south over this summer, and we had planned to both find work near our states biggest city (and our state is across the country from where her internship is). I had been applying nonstop for work there, when my girlfriend lets me know she changed her mind and didnt want to end up there and wanted to settle in our hometown for a while. Ok, no big deal, that allows me to continue playing with my band ive been in for a year or so. So now I have a lead on a job that I could have in a year or two teaching recording engineering at a local college, which is the first lead I've had after 80 applications nation wide. My band is also finding some momentum. We finished our first album and have begun receiving airplay from some college radios. I should note my dream and guiding goal has always been to play music, and its finally starting to pan out even a bit.

I asked my girlfriend what progress she made in applying for jobs around the area after three months of her at her internship, and she said she applied to two places (even including that big city she decided she didnt want to go to). Fucking two places. Today she tells me shes getting a job offer down south as an exercise physiologist and wants to take it and for me to come down with her. She says she will only keep the job for two years, and wanted me to give up my band, family, and job lead to come live with her. I told her no, and that she should try to find a job around our area, considering she has a degree in health fitness and could find a job in a hospital relatively easily. She told me no, and she was absolutely going to take this job, and I told her I was absolutely not going to give up my life to live down there for two years.

She said she would be willing to keep dating as a long distance relationship during that time, but I dont know if i can do that. We've been long distance for four years now and it drove me insane. I was so relieved thinking we could begin our life together now, and I just dont think I can go another two years without a real relationship, especially now out of college.

She keeps insisting she wont be able to find a job up near our hometown, and because of how she failed to even attempt to put in effort to make our plan of being together work, I dont know if I'll even be able to trust that after those two years are up she'll be able to stick with any future plans. What do I do reddit? I'm absolutely terrified.

Feel free to read it all, but the last two paragraphs are the significant part. Also, I do not mean to come across as arrogant ( I am far from it ). Just observations. Thank you.

**--------------------------------------------------------------**

High school was an interesting time for Cosbys. I was a chubby and nerdy honor student who secretly played World of Warcraft all day outside of school. When senior year rolled around, I got fit. I was able to look the way I wanted to both physically and materially. Girls began talking to me. As someone who had never had much interaction with girls, I had extreme anxiety. My shyness came across as arrogance because I would refuse to enter social situations. As Larry David puts it, I had 'shy/asshole confusion.' Girls would talk to me, and I would freeze up, basically walking away to avoid the situation. I somewhat started to get the idea girls were into me after one girl I was  into bluntly put 'you're really hot. when did this happen?' I basically waddled away from that conversation, going through the rest of the year as an awkward penguin around girls, spending all my time after class on WoW gearing up my level 80 undead warlock. 


Near graduation I got into a fist fight, and my face was broken in several spots. I had to undergo reconstructive surgery, and I thought I had lost what little confidence I had stemming from my good looks. When graduation neared closer, a couple girls got fed up with my lack of understanding their hints and went aggressive as a last chance to get me. One of the girls went to my house to check up on my face after surgery. I, of course, picked her after she kissed me.


The relationship was awkward, but she boosted my self-esteem so much in the beginning. She made me understand all the hints throughout high school girls had given me. Apparently, many girls talked about me. They talked how I was the hottest boy in the whole high school and how they would want to have threesomes with me. I did not care though. I had her.

When college came around, we broke up. I went to HYPS; she went to a private school out west. The girl I was madly infatuated with was gone from my life physically. I came to the realization that my face indeed looked different from reconstructive surgery too. I noticed girls were no longer eyeing me on the way to class. Was I ugly now? I had to befriend new people. Everything was just so different. I entered a state of depression. I skipped class and played WoW 24/7. From valedictorian to 2.0 student, I considered suicide but was not brave enough to do anything permanent in my life. I go for a year hoping I accidentally die in a plane crash.

Enter sophomore year, I am still depressed but am past my suicidal tendencies. I feel like I can fix my social and academic life. I become a 3.0 student. I go out about three times a semester with friends but am still too depressed and shy to have fun. I spend all my time playing WoW after I find some excuse for social life to be boring. I am disappointed with my life.

Now it is the summer before junior year, and I have fixed my outlook on life in hopes to change things. I have a very competitive paying internship, have quit WoW, and am practicing my social skills to all sexes through the help of /r/seduction. I feel confident with my future and my own person. Unfortunately, I am still lacking on the girls part.


**------------------------------------------------------------**

Gay guys and older women are the only ones attracted to me. I have had so many gays and MILFs since the end of semester check me out, hit on me, and tell me I should go into modeling. Very aggressive. I have confidence in my looks again. As I am hetero, I am to the point where I think I am destined to be a boytoy to an older rich lady because no one my age finds me attractive or interesting. I do find older ladies to be very hot, but I think it is time to deal with girls my own age.


I want to go back to college this year and dominate socially and academically. I understand the importance of being happy with oneself is important and believe I have reached that. I also believe I am not socially awkward around girls anymore, but I am still not brave enough for approaches or even asking girls I talk to out. How do I attract and seduce women my age? I think the lack of attention from women in college could be due to the school I go to (HYPS), attracting more females who tunnel-vision academics over social life; however, I do not like to blame and hold my self accountable.


Is there any advice on what to do? thanks.


tl;dr - social idiot around girls my age. highly attract older women and gays but am interested in girls my age. advice?"

I chose it because it's within biking distance of work, downtown Pasadena and the Rose Bowl, and was told that the house is safe. I had no clue about the Pasadena neighborhoods, and thought Pasadena was all a safe area.

Well, I feel safe inside my house and going out during the day, but as a small, young, female on a bike once the sun goes down I'm scared of leaving the house. After being heavily harassed on the bus the one time I rode it at night and seeing that two rapes have occurred within the last month near my house, I'm finding myself extremely unhappy with living here. It's becoming very stressful to balance being a runner, managing groceries and going to work all on a bike during daylight hours, especially now that the days are getting shorter. I feel like I can't do anything to enjoy myself (I'm very active) during the week because I get home about an hour before sunset and feel like if I go outside my door at night I might get shot/raped/abducted. Any tips? Is it really as bad out there as I'm thinking? 

My university is smack in the middle of the Cincinnati ghetto, but I guess having a car and a college made me feel safe, whereas here I have neither of these things. I feel very lonely as my roommates and I are on different schedules and I find myself sitting in the house alone a lot. They feel safe being out super late because they have cars. It's hard for me to meet people because I have no interest in drinking (wouldn't be able to get in places anyway, I'm 20), all the interns my age at work have left, and even if I did meet people I can't go somewhere if the sun will go down while I'm out. My depression and anxiety are returning and hindering my work, and I just don't know what to do for these next three months. Thanks.

Edit: Something that has been bugging me is: would it be safe for me to ride a bike to go running at the Rose Bowl at 5:30 am? When the sun was rising at 5:30 I felt safe and had a lovely morning routine, but now that it's still dark at that point in the morning I'm not sure if this is a good idea. "
yafwa,4,2012-08-15,How much do you (honestly) like NYC?,xScribbled,AskNYC,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/yafwa/how_much_do_you_honestly_like_nyc/,"As a 20 year old, ready to graduate college in a year, one of the things that has been on my mind lately is where I'd like to live post-graduation. I know this has a lot to do with jobs, but luckily, I've had about four internships and am studying an in-demand computer-related major, so hopefully the job part isn't a big problem.

I'm currently interning close to San Francisco, and, while I like the laid-back culture and the lovely weather of the west coast, most of my family is on the east coast and I love seasons. Ultimately, I'm a city-person. I love being in the center of everything and having unlimited activities around me.

That being said, I want to get honest opinions from people who live in NYC. As someone who has only visited, I'm afraid I may be romanticizing it a bit. Money isn't too much of a problem, I know it'll be expensive wherever I go (SF has similarly high renting prices), but is it really an amazing place to live? I want to be surrounded by culture, huge buildings, great transportation, amazing food, central park, and everything I've seen in movies.

So, how do you like NYC? I'm just trying to see what people think about the city as a place for someone right out of college who literally knows no one there. The huge issue on my mind right now is SF vs. NYC and I'm having a hard time getting used to SF because it seems to close down at 10pm, it's far from home (I am from PA), and it's the same weather year round."

It seemed like a typical day today at the Family Research Council in Washington, DC, that is until a phony intern appeared in the lobby and started criticizing the group’s conservative policies.

That’s when security guard Leo Johnson asked him where he was going and received a violent reply — a gunshot wound to the arm.  DC Police Chief Cathy Lanier is calling Johnson a hero.  “He did his job. The person never made it past the front.”

Despite his injury, Johnson wrestled 28 year-old Floyd Lee Corkins, of Herndon, Virginia, to the ground and took away his gun.  Corkins is in custody.  The FBI says it’s treating the incident as a case of domestic  terrorism.  

Johnson is listed in stable condition and apparently never lost consciousness.

Twenty-three gay rights groups, longtime opponents of the Council’s traditional marriage stance, have condemned the attack in a joint statement.  “We were saddened to hear news of the shooting this morning at the offices of the Family Research Council. Our hearts go out to the shooting victim, his family, and his co-workers.”

The Family Research Council spun off from Doctor James Dobson’s Focus on the Family organization in 1992.

y9pu3,3,2012-08-15,I feel like everything turning to shit again.,[deleted],MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/y9pu3/i_feel_like_everything_turning_to_shit_again/,"This is not a throwaway, so if you know me please have the decency to not read this post.

This past week has been shit. Things have just been piling up which I could deal with one at a time, but the cumulative weight is crushing me. I suppose I can break it down into the 3 things that are really taking a toll.

The first is with my internship. It's the first full-time employment I've had, but I felt as though I was getting the hang of things. I thought that I liked everyone there, but my supervisor seemed overly critical of my work. I thought I could make things allright by trying to do things right and be extra-nice to counter his coldness towards me. Since then, it's only escalated. He seems to have singled me out, for a reason I cannot understand (and I have spend many nights trying to understand why he hates me) wants to make my life hell. He constantly checks on my work, but unlike everybody else where he goes over and has a chat and a laugh, he scrutinises it for any flaws where he can make me start over. I am consistently being isolated from everyone else, and because of this I am not making deadlines, despite working lots of overtime to compensate. I have no power in this situation, because if I get fired from this internship it will mean I have to stay back 1 or 2 years at university. It's like back in high school, except people think there is something wrong with you if you say you are being bullied. 20 year-olds are meant to be able to deal with this, right?

Next is the club I was most active in at Uni, where the admins have decided they don't like me there anymore. The root of their problem with me is that I like to joke around on the Facebook page, troll a little, all in good nature. I know when to stop, and I know what is too far. Still, my posts will be jumped on and misconstrued the second I post there now by these insufferably unhumorous people. I am uninvited from events and generally made to feel unwanted. I doubt they would outright ban me from the club, as I have good friends there, but it is clear they will continue this until I decide to leave on ""my own will"". This and the situation at my work are making me feel that people are against me, or that there is something wrong with me that is making everybody hate me. I know this isn't really the case (I've been through that thought trap before), but I feel this way now.

The last one is a girl (ain't it always). Someone who I liked immediately after meeting, then forgetting about when I found out she had a boyfriend. Well now she's single, and looking for someone, which should be great for me. Instead, all that's happened is that I've been reminded of how coy she acts. I could chase her round and round for weeks, but I doubt I'd be any closer to her. Everything seems like a game around her, and I'm too tired to go on any longer.

I just needed to write this down for therapy. Lying awake I could almost feel the black dog at my door, something I haven't felt in a long time, and it honestly scares the shit out of me. Although I don't know if you can, can you try to make me feel better?"
y9dfx,14,2012-08-15,"I'm [f 21] so confused, sick, and exhausted by my relationship with my boyfriend [21]. I just want to write everything out and hope that someone can help me-- I desperately need some advice.",feelinglikerobin,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/y9dfx/im_f_21_so_confused_sick_and_exhausted_by_my/,"This is so long and drawn-out, I don't even know if I can include everything. I'll do my best to summarize, though.

My boyfriend and I are both 21 and seniors in college. We started dating around the end of the first semester in college, so almost 3 years now. We met through a club and some mutual friends. We weren't friends before the relationship started-- it was very fast. After 2 weeks of talking he told me he loved me and asked me to be his girlfriend. I told him I loved him about 2 months into the relationship.

I can't tell how much of our relationship is forced, and I'm not even sure what I mean by this. For quite a while now, I've felt like I'm just forcing 2 puzzle pieces to fit together. I've questioned our relationship for at least a year, especially when we have extended time apart. Long-distance periods happen a lot, too, as he's Indian and came to the US for school; our first summer after freshman year, we got an apartment together, but for the 2 summers after that he's gone home for the entire summer-- 7 months total.

Last year (the beginning of our junior year), he got a job as an RA and, due to rigorous training and duties, we were basically unable to make any plans for over a month. I remember how upset I was that I'd found it easier to talk to him when he was in India than when he was just a block away. He could have gone days without talking to me and I don't think he even noticed. I believed he was busy, but it's very hurtful to think that the person you've been dating for 2 years can't even send you a text once a day to ask how you're doing. I even told him this, at the time and he acknowledged it, but nothing changed. After about a month, I couldn't take it anymore-- it was an accumulation of feeling like we weren't compatible, time apart that had gone on for too long, and feeling unappreciated, I just was done. I told him I wanted to break up someday in September 2011 and for 2 hours we talked and he tried to talk me out of it. I just kept saying I thought we weren't compatible (which is still to this day the truth). Finally he got up and told me that if he left my room he would never talk to me again. I was fine for about 20 minutes and then I started freaking out. He was the person I was closest to for almost 2 years and he would never speak to me again? The thought of him moving on in life without me kills me-- I want to know what he does with his life, because I really do love him. I called him probably 50 times and asked him to come back and he actually did surprisingly quickly.

The thing is though, since that time, not only had nothing changed for the better, but the breakup was festering in his mind all the time-- I didn't even realize how much until just recently. This brings us to the back story of present-day.

Since starting college, I knew I wanted to complete a study abroad trip before graduating. Picking a program for me was a contest between one in Europe and one in the Middle East; I had been studying Arabic for years now, and I decided to choose the more challenging program. The thing is, I didn't really discuss is with my boyfriend-- I really just told him after I'd already discussed it with my parents and decided. I honestly had no reason to think that he would be mad at me-- my thoughts were that he was going home to India for the summer anyway, and our relationship was going to be long-distance whether I traveled to the Middle East or not. I had no idea my trip would impact our relationship so much. However, I only found out around my 2nd week into my trip just how offended he was by everything. Throughout the entire trip he was the *definition* of unsupportive. Whenever I told him a story about my day, he would be an ass. Whenever I wanted to go out in the town with my classmates, he would guilt me out of it. One time I went out with my host family to the mall pretty late and he called me on my cellphone to tell me that he didn't think he could do this anymore and he didn't think I cared about him while I cried in the bathroom, trying to hide everything from my host family.

The worst fight spawned from a story that I thought my boyfriend would find funny about something my male classmate did. Instead, he cut me off and told me I should just date him instead, because I obviously liked him more. This turned into a 24-hour fight that turned nasty and he very seriously almost broke up with me over Skype, but I begged him not and that I would make it up to him.

Now we're back at school, living in the same place, and he's said very clearly that it is my responsibility to change and to prove to him that I want to be in this relationship. However, we are both still incredibly bitter about the entire study abroad. As far as I'm concerned, he **ruined** the trip for me because he was so bitter. For 3/4 of the trip, he was bitter and angry and completely immature. For the last 1/4, he finally realized how immature he was and apologized, but it's only half an apology. The thing is, both of us know we could have handled things better in the past 2 months, but I wonder if it's too late to fix anything.

It probably sounds like there are a lot of things that set off this post, but there was one thing that really made me unable to ignore it any longer. Yesterday, I got an email from my academic adviser about a 3-month internship in Washington D.C. during the Spring 2012 semester that would be an amazing opportunity for me-- it sounds too perfect. However, as I was reading the information, I already was scared to bring it up to my boyfriend, and the fact that I have any fear really sickens me. When I brought it up last night, he said that he couldn't believe I could even bring it up after the severe dip our relationship took over the summer. He told me in no uncertain terms that if I did the internship, that would end our relationship (he can't do anymore long-distance). I think I'm still in shock.

Considering the fact that our relationship sometimes feels like it's been on the precipice of failure for almost a full year now, I wonder if what's held us together for this long is even worth it. I really do love him, but I have so many doubts. He is my first relationship ever and I have nothing to compare this to. I also have heard about the anguish of first love and I wonder if the reason I feel nauseous is because I know that chances are that my first boyfriend is not my ""soul mate,"" but I've never been this attached to someone. My biggest problems are that he can be very immature and extremely unsupportive.

TL;DR: I feel like my boyfriend is the most unsupportive ""friend"" I have ever had in my life, and I'm starting to realize that it really really sucks. The thing is, we have such different POVs with everything, I have no idea who is right or who needs to change. Are my expectations too high? Am I being a bitch? Should we just call it quits? I know that you only have my side of the story (and it's fucking long at that), but please help me. I desperately need some kind of guidance."
y8xkn,2,2012-08-15,Straight up fuck everything right now.,roostacia,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/y8xkn/straight_up_fuck_everything_right_now/,"Today was supposed to be a good day god dammit. I got to buy food for the first time in a month, life had settled down enough to where I could go back to my internship, supposed to hang out with a friend who I haven't seen in a long time. But no.

My evening ends with arguing with my ex over how many of my pets I would get to take back if I can get them registered as therapy pets for when I move into the dorms, and that's IF I can get them registered as such. They are rats and there are 3 of them. One has spent most of his life with the other two and it would be a really mean thing to do if I were to have to pick one or two of them instead of just doing the logical thing and taking all of them. So I decide to blow off some steam, I'll see if I can hang out with two of my best friends....

...Too bad one's boyfriend came home from his job as a firefighter, and I don't want to interrupt that dynamic with me being sad, and my other friend's car is broke and literally can't even pay her lazy fucking room mate to let her borrow his car. So now I'm stuck, in the place where I'm staying where I feel uncomfortable and out of place, being sad with nobody to talk to, nothing to comfort me, and as an ent on hard times, nothing to fucking smoke.

Now I'm super pissed off and I just want to scream and cry and punch things. but I'm here funneling all of my anger and sadness  
So I guess it's better than spewing hate somewhere else...but seriously, I'd rather be anywhere else right now. My life just won't stop shitting on me lately and It'd be super fucking nice if things could actually start looking up for me. 

Cause not only am I dealing with all of this shit, after 8 months of telling me he will get me a car since he has so many, that the city that he lives in is threatening him with some sort of fine or some bullshit for having so many working cars within city limits. When I actually NEED one, my dumbass brother in law is being a flaky dick hole about me actually getting this car. I've even looked into insurance and shit. I just fucking need the damn thing and he's all like ""Well i'll be able to get it to you AFTER YOU REALLY NEED IT"" 

THANKS FOR EVERYTHING LIFE. I FUCKING HATE YOU RIGHT NOW."

y8fwe,14,2012-08-14,"If someone like me ever hurt you, I am so, so sorry",apologetic_liar,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/y8fwe/if_someone_like_me_ever_hurt_you_i_am_so_so_sorry/,"I am in my mid-twenties, and I am currently working on my PhD at an Ivy league university (studying a hard science). I am a petite, above-average looking female (nerds think I'm hot, bros don't, you know that kind of thing). I have an amazing life. I live 800 miles from where I grew up.

I had an ok upbringing. I resent my parents for certain things, but by and large they weren't any worse than anyone else's parents and they did as best as they could given their own mental neurosis. I was pretty socially awkward growing up. 

I started lying around the time one of my best friend's family friend raped me. Only he didn't rape me in my eyes because I was 14 and I thought that rape was when a man old enough to be your dad forced you to have sexual intercourse. My rape involved someone my age putting pencils in my vagina. I wanted to communicate that I had been *raped*, but in my mind, I had never been properly raped. (I know now that that was rape, just to clarify). I felt like I was a liar telling the small handful of people I confided in that I had been raped. I felt like I couldn't press charges because it wasn't proper rape. I even began to have fantasies about him just finishing the job, so to speak.

It started out with fairly insignificant things, like I would say I've been playing piano for 5 years if I'd only been playing for 2. I would tell people I was a vegan, and I would only be a vegetarian. 

It got worse after highschool. My freshman year of college, I told everyone I met that I was raised a different religion than I was simply because my best friend in high school was of that faith. I transferred schools.

My sophomore year of college, I started to get physically sick. I would invent reasons for my sickness, like strange out of the blue rare allergies. I ended up gaining weight because of sickness. I moved in with my boyfriend at the time, and I smoked weed constantly. I started having these hallucinations where I would think I had a conversation with someone, and later I would find out that that conversation had never happened.

There was this dude I went to school with. I had what I now believe was a hallucination where he told me that he could hack my internet history and he periodically checked who would google his name. I began to hate this man because I thought he was trying to mess with my head. I treated him like I hated him, and he was very confused by my actions. I also began to have hallucinations where I would see a ghost in my car, and he would sometimes be there even when I had other people in the car.

I began noticing that I had less hallucinations when I would starve myself. During my junior year of college, I lost twenty-five pounds because I starved myself (I am 5'3"" and a small boned woman) and dropped to a dangerously low weight. I didn't starve myself because I wanted to be skinny, but rather because I had less hallucinations when I starved myself. I don't know why I didn't get professional help, but I think it was mainly because I was still maintaining a high GPA at my university and performing well at work, so I let ego get the best of me. 

The lying got worse. My behavior was pretty erratic around the man I had a hallucination about, and I would begin to have hallucinations about the other people in my major talking about me. I would do hallucinogens on my weekends, thinking they would somehow enlighten me as to why everything was so horrible. 

I felt like I had no control over what came out of my mouth. I told the people from school my parents were immigrants from Germany and that I grew up speaking German (which is in no way true). They eventually found out about this blatant lie and understandably were standoffish towards me. I thought if I told more lies I could somehow communicate why I was doing all of the crazy things I was doing and people wouldn't hate me anymore. 

The only thing that made me feel better was amphetamines. I was never a proper addict, but I used them about once a week. I still had hallucinations, but I didn't mind them as much when I was on amphetamines.

This is what I feel the most horrible about. I was sick and didn't want to have sex with my boyfriend because I had no sex drive, and I felt that I would have a sex drive if he was a woman. I slept with a couple of women and even came out as a lesbian to a couple of my friends (somehow I still had friends through all of this). I am not a lesbian. I am embarrassed and ashamed that I portrayed the homosexual community in a negative way. I am so ashamed that I took such a serious matter so lightly.

I was caught plagiarizing at school (just using an unauthorized online source, nothing that was very serious). Somehow I got out of that one. Anyway, to sum me up after my junior year of college: I was emaciated, I used amphetamines/alcohol/weed/hallucinogens on all too regular of a basis, and I felt as though no one trusted me to tell the truth about anything because, frankly, I couldn't trust myself to tell the truth. 

I was diagnosed with a treatable autoimmune disease a week before I left for a prestigious summer internship. Starving felt better than eating because *I was sick.* I cannot emphasize enough how much of a relief this was to hear. 

At the internship, I slowly started to physically feel better, and my behavior improved. I would still lie about things, but the lies became less and less of stretches and more and more of the truth. I began realizing how disrespectful it was of me to belittle people by not valuing their trust. 

I started hating myself less. I put on weight, and all of a sudden, people think I'm attractive, which was so novel to me. I was more confident because of this, and developed social skills. I was still able to get into my graduate program, and I moved a couple of months after graduation to an amazing city. I began to seriously run. I am now training for a marathon. 

Over the course of the last several years, I've gotten better and better about lying to people. I am so blessed that I got sick because it made me evaluate **everything** about my life. I made a vow to myself a year ago to tell the truth about everything. Of course, sometimes I slip up, but now I catch myself right away after a lie and say, ""I'm sorry, I don't know why I just said that, that isn't true at all,"" and I realize that people are ok with that.

Something I've realized is that **people are willing to forgive you if you are willing to forgive yourself** I've slowly come to forgive myself, though I may still be ashamed of some of my former behaviors. **i am so blessed** because people forgave me (not everyone -- it hurts when people don't forgive you and you know it's your fault), and I am happy with where I'm going in life. I now have the skill of being able to relate to and help people going through what I went through.

I tell people that I become close to that I went through a time period I'm not proud of. I don't go into this much detail because I don't want to dwell on guilt, but rather to transcend it and become the person I want to be. I currently am in a healthy relationship with a man I love, and he knows about nearly all of this, but some of it I just can't vocalize.  

If you've read this far, thank you for reading. If you've ever been hurt by someone like me, I'm sorry. I am so, so sorry. 

TLDR- I was a compulsive liar/anorexic and did too many drugs in college, still did well, and I have an amazing life now (totally sober, amazing relationship, on a good path)."

ybtng,12,2012-08-16,How to approach Christmas with a toddler in preschool,MrsAnthropy,atheistparents,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheistparents/comments/ybtng/how_to_approach_christmas_with_a_toddler_in/,"I found [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheistparents/comments/td7bq/religious_holiday_traditions_in_an_atheist_family/) from three months ago about how different atheist parents approach the more religious-based holidays with their young ones. It was an interesting read and I've definitely come away with ideas about how our family will celebrate during the more religious-based holidays. What I'm wondering is what sort of questions she'll come home with.

Long story short: my daughter turned three at the end of June and has just started preschool so that I can work and complete a teaching internship this fall. It's a lot more than we can really afford, but she enjoys it tremendously and I can't get a teaching job next fall without this unpaid internship. 

Her school came very highly recommended, has a pretty diverse group of students, and follows a lot of state guidelines (accredited and whatnot), but it's attached to a Lutheran church. I've never addressed Santa and have always been honest about where gifts from. She recognizes Santa Claus as a figure related to Christmas and, at three, she just thinks Christmas is another birthday--PRESENTS. 

The paperwork I filled out for her school included a very respectfully worded question about giving permission for the child to participate in ""holiday-themed activities if the child chooses to be involved,"" but that was it. 

So when a child as young as three (she'll be 3.5 at Christmastime) goes to a preschool, she's bound to have questions, right? I don't want her to be the butthead who tells other kids that Santa doesn't exist, but I'm also not really interested in making a big deal out of it. I want her to appreciate what people do for her. On the other hand, she's way too young to be able to separate fantasy from reality and I don't want to quash the magical quality Christmas can have for children. 

Do any other atheist parents have experiences like this? How did you address it with your kids when they're that small? What sorts of questions will she have? How can I keep her from spoiling Santa for other kids if I choose not to encourage that myth? Am I an asshole if I don't encourage it?

**I was hoping you could tell me how to get, or send me in the direction of, access to the accounts of football clubs in the UK. Specifically I'm looking for the total amount a premier league club spends on wages and transfers in a given season.**

The reason I ask is that I'm doing an Econometrics Project (type of disserataion) on the correlation of club spending on wages with league finishing position. 

A friend of mine who did an internship for one of the UK big 4 gave me Arsenal Holding PLC's accounts for 2009-2010. From that I could gain that Arsenal FC paid staff a total of £107,944,000 to their staff in 2010 which is the info I'm looking for (if I could get a document specifically noting player wages that'd be great). For the project to work I need this info for every Premier League Club.

So do you guys know how I'd go about getting this information?

Thanks in advance for your help"
ybjfh,3,2012-08-16,Split system questions and concerns,acp54,HVAC,https://www.reddit.com/r/HVAC/comments/ybjfh/split_system_questions_and_concerns/,"I've been designing a cooling system for a police station built in 1949, with light renovations done twice though out its life.

Because of the layout of the building five separate cooling zones and a split system will be used (thus far thats what im imagining). 1 zone is occupied 24/7, the other zones are occupied 8 hours a day.

I have done the CLTD calculations and its an average of 20,000BTU/hr for each zone. The smallest being 16,000 and the largest is 23,000 BTU/hr. Each zone is under 550 sqft, That seems like a large Q for the size of the rooms, but a lot of people have to work in these small spaces. (5 people work in a space of 250 sqft).

My questions are:

* Whats the best way to keep humidity from being an issue with split system units, since there is no recirculated air (just infiltration)? The building is in Philadelphia.

* Two of the zones have supervisors offices, which have doors.  whats the best way to cool the supervisors rooms? Splitting the zone farther and installing smaller units per zone? or installing a single unit and letting the air circulate. 

* Whats the best way to check to make sure im not messing anything up? I'm on an internship which doesnt have a design team. There are staff engineers though. I really don't want to size the system too small, and over-sizing is something i want to avoid, i assume over-sizing is the better option. 

* Does anyone have any experience with the Mitsubishi split system?

* Roughly, how many cooling units can be connected to one condenser?  

* Lastly, which would be a better option a 1 large multi-split system; individual splits for each zone? Or combination? At the very least a couple of the 8-hours/day zones could be on the same condenser. 

Sorry for all the questions, and thanks for your help!"

The girl I transferred schools to be with? She split. My grandmother, whom I dearly loved and loved me back, and who was the only one to ever give me any credit or praise in life? The breast cancer won. School? That was going swimmingly... until I get a little message from the university, telling me that that financial aid money I was planning on? Well, my father (who, for tax reasons and his refusal to let me see the tax receipts) simply forgot to fill out the forms I literally taped to his headboard. Oh, and the student loan monies I took for the year? Those forms were fucked up by him, too, so much so that not only did I not have enough to get me through the spring, but I didn't even have enough to cover the fall. Tack on a cousin who was beginning to be lost to heroin, the recession taking the jobs of several aunts, uncles and cousins, and suddenly I had some problems. Me, who was always the guy with his act together, who always had a plan, an out, who was going to go the distance and have that magazine life, well, I found myself alone, in a dirty apartment in the wrong neighborhood in a strange new city. Alone. 

I wallowed. I shuffled about between a pair of shit jobs, going through the motions, counting the minutes until I could stop by the state store on my way home for my evening's bottle of Canadian Gold brand whiskey. 

It got so bad, after three months of no human contact that I began to think about ending it. They say that when your thoughts of suicide change from abstracts to planning, then, well, you have a problem buddy! I picked out a pylon on a nearby bridge, and thought about the logistics of jumping. I figured 4am would be the ideal time. It would be deserted, children wouldn't be awake yet and the tide would clean the concrete base of any mess I'd make. I thought that was considerate of me.

Yea, I took a few of months. I pulled myself together, though. I lost the weight, got my finances in order and landed both an internship and a gig at the pub near campus. Though my dark days came on like a violent blizzard that shuts down a community, with the creeping of the sun and the thaw of the ice, I rejoined the world. I graduated, Phi Beta Kappa with degrees in Philosophy and Economics. I also secured a half dozen recommendations for my future, from professors, department heads and a prominent businessman in my city (which I've made mine. I lost a year of my life wallowing and feeling sorry for myself.

Just a year. I've already earned better credentials than most could hope for. Guess what? I feel like I am seventy goddamned years old instead of the twenty three year old kid I am. I have my entire life ahead of me. Nothing is fucked, nothing is lost and any fuck ups I've had have been repaired. Everyone in my damned family... They all look at me like I'm a junkie. That phony, saccharine warmth you reserve for uncomfortable interactions at parties? It's all that I get now. Strange looks when I walk into a family event, that 'oh my, he's here. did you hear what happened to -- at college? well my johnny said...'. Christ. Give me credit, God, give me some fucking credit. I should be out enjoying my life, going to all of those great places I see that my peers have been to on Facebook. Instead, I am stuck with the histrionic tirades of my drunk parents, and my sister's gossips poisoning my family against me. 

I'm a good kid. I've never done anything really bad. I studied hard, and worked to stay in school. I've graduated, and with great marks. Just because I had a bad winter a while back, and it has taken more than just three weeks for me to figure my entire life out, does not mean that I have ruined anything. My race hasn't even begun yet and already I feel fatigued. Thanks for reading. "
yb0vl,4,2012-08-16,Help! I [21F] got dumped by my boyfriend [23M] and am sliding back into depression.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/yb0vl/help_i_21f_got_dumped_by_my_boyfriend_23m_and_am/,"I don't know where to turn to, so I came here.


My boyfriend and I have been dating for around 14 months. I have had depression and self-harming issues from years ago. It took a while for me to be open about these with my boyfriend, but I opened up after about 6 months. Our relationship is amazing, we get along so well, are very similar, similar tastes in music, movies, television. We have a lot of fun together.


From about month 10, we've been starting to strain the relationship. I get too emotional about things/take things too personally and dump my emotions on my boyfriend. I feel bad for it because he's started tending to my every emotional need when he doesn't even have to time to do so.


In month 12, my boyfriend lost his job and got a lower than predicted grade at college, forcing him to resit the course for the summer, whilst unemployed. A week after he lost the job, I was due to start a two month internship on the other side of the planet. I thought that two months would be long, but our relationship would survive.


Ultimately, it was one of the worst two months of my life. Our relationship got more strained, the time zones were inconvenient and we had a limited amount of communication. Because of this, I couldn't fully support him through the toughest time of his life, and he withdrew his feelings from me because he felt I wasn't giving him the support. Finally, whilst trying to change my ways and direct my attention to him, instead of me talking about my emotions all the time, I neglected to mention that I had been mugged, and kept it from him kinda so I didn't worry him.


During an argument about how little we were committed to each other in the long distance period, I used my mugging as leverage to show that he didn't know what I had been going through during these past two months. Stupid, I know.


He was very disappointed that I didn't tell him this and didn't know if he could continue on in the relationship. We eventually made nice and agreed to discuss everything on my immanent return.


When I came back, it was like everything was in the past. I thought we could go back to how we used to. I tried to tell him I was changed.


A week after I've come back, he dumped me, saying the past two months changed everything. He said that he doesn't want to be in a relationship with me anymore. I *need* him because even thought we sometimes have shit times, the good times are amazing! He makes me such a better person and has helped with my depression so much. I think he may be projecting his problems on to me unknowingly. He calls our relationship 'unhealthy' because of the bickering. I've told him that I will stop being so overemotional and I'm going to go back to therapy today, but I want to know that I will still have this relationship as well.


I love him so much and he says he loves me and wants to support me but doesn't want to be in a relationship with me anymore. I've begged for a week to change his mind, to come back to me. I don't know for sure if he will, but I need him to give me one last shot. 


**TL;DR: After a strained two months of long distance, it seems my boyfriend can't hack it anymore, but I feel like I need and want him back in order to help cope with my depression and I believe he is not considering all the good times as well as the bad.**


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Do I have a chance? What else can I do besides my therapy to show I'm committed to giving this relationship another shot? Am I being too clingy perhaps?"

And I'm also nervous about the weather... I'm from Florida and I've lived in hot, humid weather my whole life. I know that this time period would be winter for the city and I can look up exact temperatures, but I would rather hear descriptions about clothing and popular activities during the time.

And lastly, how easy is it to travel within the country? I would love to see Johannesburg and the Drakensberg region as well.  

I appreciate any advice :)"

(long but with bolds and TLDR)",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yas8z/23f_im_in_a_tricky_situation_with_my_so_26m/,"Hi Reddit. 

**Together 1yr+, lots of fun and honesty and sex.** I've been with my SO for over a year. We have lots of fun, and even though we're very different people we have a lot in common. He's a professional in the tech industry, working very hard both full time and trying to get a freelance business going. I try to support him in every way I can. I'm a masters student and an intern in a science field. 

**Bicker occasionally, otherwise healthy and comfortable relationship** I think sometimes we misscommunicate, but don't we all? We're usually really good about talking stuff through and fight very seldom. The sex is great, we're on the same page about our lives and our time frames and all the biggies. Blah blah. 

**General Practitioner threw out all kinds of crazy diagnoses and referrals, which was a lot of tests and pain for nothing, told him to loose weight** This doctor sent him on this crazy 5000k trail of referrals and imagine, only to find out that he had something that he was born with, and is totally normal. This Doctor threw out all kinds of wild serious diseases and conditions, and surgeries, to find nothing.  He also told him to eat healthier and drink less. I've been totally supportive, we go hiking, I cook a lot, etc. 

** I was very supportive, we cook, we drink a lot less and eat a lot healthier. I'm usually pretty healthy but i'm trying to be supportive of him more** 

**Months later, doctor starts doing the same craziness again. Doctor admits to missing lab results from months ago. I'm adamant that he get a second opinion from a more specialized doctor** Fast forward. He's been eating a lot better and drinking less, and the doctor has told him to cut back more and is referring him to another specialist for something he says he's sure that he doesn't have, he just missed these lab results months ago. 

I told him to get a second opinion before he goes through all this nonsense again with the doctor who has admitted to missing lab results. He kinda hemmed and hawed and said he trusted him, and i got frustrated and said that he wouldn't put up with this for a second from any other professional, that this is his health and he needs to get someone else. (He makes good $$$ and has great insurance).

**SO gets defensive, says that *we* need to work on it more when my health is great and i've been nothing but supportive. I continue to be adamant, he says i'm yelling at him, I say that im just worried, he hangs up to go to the gym** He said that *WE* need to work harder to be healthier, several times, even though I always eat better than him, and suggest healthy food. He's a big boy, and i feel like he's blaming me and just letting this doctor scare him but not taking serious action. I told him that I wasn't yelling at him, but that i was upset and nervous about his health. He said he had to go to the gym, and that it ""certainly sounded like I was yelling at him"". 

**Since he loves beer, and has been drinking in moderation, I made the deposit on a patio at a brewery for a big surprise dinner party next week. DAMN** Now I feel like the bitch who got upset with him about his medical stuff, and i'm throwing a party that's enabling an unhealthy lifestyle when he was just told to cut out drinking all together. 

Do I explain about the party to him? I'm going to apologize and clarify my tone, but insist that he get a second opinion. We've just been bickering a lot recently, and I dunno whats up. I keep trying to make it better but I feel like i do the wrong things. 

I love him and I want him to be healthy.

TL; DR. SO has mediocre health and a mediocre doctor, he gets defensive when i say he needs a second opinion. Dr. told him not to drink and be healthier (I agree) but I had already planned a surprise party at a brewery for next week. "

I was fortunate enough to get an internship over the summer with a company specailizing in internet and data security. I loved it but, unfortunately it's over and I'm still pretty curious. I'd like to continue my education in security and since it's been so popular I'd like to do some reading with SQL and JS injection. I know my way around JS pretty well and have done some work with mySQL but nothing ground breaking or anything.
Does anyone have good books, videos, tutorials on either subject?

The information security guy got up to give his lecture. One of his major points: Don't watch porn on the computers because it gums up the network. Apparently it is a major problem that they have had to deal with because of the adware and spyware that gets on to the network via porn sites. 

Then later, the ethics lecturer got up and said it again: Don't watch porn. It has been a problem with male and female employees sitting at work and watching porn. 

I am floored that people have the brass nuts to sit in their cubicles (I work in a cubicle farm) and watch porn at work. Especially on a computer network that security monitors and know exactly who is visiting these sites.
I thought I wouldn't learn anything since I had sat through this orientation as an intern a couple years back but apparently 2 years and the network is one giant porn-fest. I couldn't stop laughing from then on out.

Would it be wiser to get a place around Coral Gables so I'm closer to work as well as the Uni? I also hear good things of Brickell..

Car. I should buy one yes? Pretty sure renting would be crazy pricey for someone my age.. In England I get around in a Fiat 500 which I'm now selling (would probably look ridiculously small in the US but it's perfect round here). Rather than getting a direct replacement like a Mini, I'm thinking I might go full on American and get myself a 60s Mustang or something - this may sound mad but if I could get one cheap then get it shipped back to the UK I could probably make a decent profit due to rareness. Plus I've always wanted a proper muscle car.. Reckon I might regret this decision?

I started when school got out this summer since I would just be running around town with my friends. At least this way I would be staying out of trouble, doing something positive for my community, and learning some valuable lessons in I.T. As a technology orientated high school we give every student their own laptop to perform their high school tasks. This week was orientation and the laptops needed to be re-imaged (copy with our own custom copy of windows) and we had just received the shipment of laptops last weekend. We had to create the master image, upload it on our server, and create stations for the laptops to be imaged. On Monday we unpacked all of the boxes and put the laptops in a closet in our I.T. room. On Tuesday we were uploading the image to the image server, but one of the other interns plugged it into the internet and all of the IP address's got jumbled and conflicted with our current network. We finally figured out and got the image ready to be pushed out to the laptops 11 PM on Tuesday night. We started right away and imaged 120 all night. Its a very low number, but were told that return Sophomores and Juniors that prepaid could only get there laptops that day. The entire school was told that they'd get their laptops that day. Students and parents were angry when I told them they would not be receiving their laptops that day. The parents questioned me sternly asking when the exact date would be that the laptop would be ready. I told them that I cannot give them a specific date, but would be ready before school starts. They proceeded to tell me they needed a date. I tried to redirect them to the principal, but they wanted the answer right away. This went on a few times. The orientation ended at about 1 PM on Wednesday. I had arrived at 11 AM the day before. I was dead tired. Later that night, I went back to school to image more laptops.

Few days ago, a 1973 Yamaha Enduro 125cc was listed on craigslist for $400 and I am contemplating whether I should go for it or not. I don't really have the budget to get something over $1000 and 1000 is a very tight budget to buy any motorcycle in Vancouver, BC, Canada.

I have yet to see the bike in person but I'm curious if this is even worth looking into. I have plenty of time before university starts and I am willing to learn to give it proper care. But I don't want to commit to a ride that is hopeless.

My dad, who used to run a autoshop, is telling me that the engine for this bike would probably be too deteriorated to make it a worth while project.

What does Reddit think about this bike?

I mentor a guy, he's 16. I have been with him for 5 years. I met him through a camp I volunteer at through a local hospice organization where we help kids get through the loss of loved ones. He is my little brother. I cry when he cries, I cheer when he succeeds. He made starting linebacker on Varsity football this year. I love this boy to death.

And unless he saw me come out on Facebook he has no idea I like guys as well as girls. I don't want to come forth with this information yet as:

1. I don't think he is mature enough to handle it. He talks about the gay kids in school being picked on. He doesn't (Thank God). I just always ask to help them out, and to keep on not doing that. I give him positive reinforcement for  making that good choice.

1. His dad is a local spiritual counselor in a hospital. He is very progressive minister (by comparison to the other in the area, but to say this is to say that a dandelion is the prettiest of all the weeds). He is a good man. I was under his guidance for 2 summers as an intern. He won't damn a gay person to hell, but if it was someone who was so close to his and his son's life.... I don't know. 

I am slightly comfortable in this place. Sure, I feel like I could be exposing my little bro to a new culture where gay guys are like him and not all froo-froo drinks and tight,sparkly clothes. Alas, I could also risk losing him, which would kill me. Thus, I sit here.

yg78a,6,2012-08-18,"Treyarch, why has this not happened yet?",Demyxt,gaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/yg78a/treyarch_why_has_this_not_happened_yet/,"I am an avid gaming and developing enthusiast, and have been for about eight years now. I have seen a majority of the ""greatest games"" of the past decade come out, and have played through almost all of them.

Let me first start off by saying that with every type of game, there will always be a group of people that DO NOT play it, and WILL NOT play it. You will never please everyone in a market, ***ever***. What I fail to understand is why Treyarch doesn't take what they know is successful with their series, (very obviously), and RUN WITH IT.

Let me start off by saying that CoD: WaW (Call of Duty: World at War), was probably the worst CoD game I have ever played to date. I can go as far as to say that I enjoyed every aspect of modern warfare 1 and the previous original games even more than that.

I ***WILL SAY***, however, that the reason World at War didn't fail altogether was because ZOMBIES MADE IT SUCCESSFUL. Sure, people played the multiplayer. Some people will comment here and tell me that I'm wrong and that's fine, because in this post I'm only stating my opinion. But when you look at the facts, if they hadn't introduced zombies, the game wouldn't be nearly as fun and well received as it has been.

I'd just like to point out:

Modern Warfare 1 - Somewhat anticipated. First real introduction to the CoD franchise so to speak.

World At War - Horrible reception on the multiplayer, HOWEVER, the idea of zombies turned people on to the game and made it a pretty great success.

Modern Warfare 2 - Got a majority of its success from the past two games, mainly because at that point the Call of Duty title was just so well known due to MW1's great reception and WaW's zombie craze.

Black Ops - More zombies. MORE, ZOMBIES. This is why PEOPLE FREAKING LOVED THIS GAME. People liked the multiplayer too. It was different, it was fun. But let me just point out yet again, FREAKING ZOMBIES. And the zombie DLC sold like HOTCAKES.

Modern Warfare 3 - Anticipated because of previous games and because of survival mode. People thought it would be like zombies. It wasn't, it sucked. Not enough detail, not enough for people to sink their teeth into.

***Here's what I'm getting at***

It is pretty obvious that the most successful aspect of the Call of Duty franchise is the fact that you can battle hordes of zombies with your friends, (or at least you can in the games made by Treyarch). So here's what I have to say to you guys.

Make a game that ***focuses solely on zombies***. I don't care what you name it, ***Call of Duty: Apocalypse*** or something sick like that. Sell preorders for it and include an AMAZING preorder-only map pack, and make it UNSHAREABLE or ONLY FOR ONE ACCOUNT, so kiddies don't go around sharing it and make it useless.

Go in to MORE DETAIL with the zombies aspect of the game. Make tons of maps and make them more in-depth. Make boss zombies, but keep the same feel of the call of duty game. Don't do something stupid like third person or make it in to a left 4 dead knockoff. Make the zombies that we ***all know and love*** in to a more extensive and challenging mode.

I work at Best Buy at the moment, and I love my job. I'm a sales associate in the gaming department. Every time I'm selling a game to someone even closely related to Call of Duty, I throw out this idea to them and they LOVE IT. The reason why is because ***the idea of zombies is such a universal one to gamers***.

I'm throwing this out there because I have a feeling that it's something everyone would like to see, and no one has really said yet. I love zombies, and I'm sticking with the opinion that ***if they made a zombie-only game in 2013, it would be the most anticipated game of the year hands down.***

If you support this idea, feel free to help me get it to the front page. I would love to get a representative from Treyarch to throw their opinion on this, which is gonna require us to give a little TLC. A lot of people will not agree with this, but I have a feeling that a majority of gamers who do end up reading this will.

I'm going to be joining the Delayed Entry program for the U.S. Air Force soon, and have worked with other branches as of recent. I very mainly play games like CoD and Battlefield because that's what suits me as a person. I'm not just a kid who thinks zombies is the bees knees, but man there's nothing more satisfying then headshotting a brain-eating freak and watching that money counter go up.

***Treyarch, if you decide to use this idea, I would love to ask that you consider allowing me to work on the project with you guys as an internship or something. I have a lot of great ideas that I think could make this project an absolute dream.***

You can reach me at tseawolph@gmail.com. My name is Tim, and thank you guys for reading. Please comment letting me know what you think.

***TL;DR - I am explaining to Treyarch that they have the chance to hit the ground running with a game that would almost without a doubt be the most anticipated CoD game yet, a game focused solely on improving and perfecting/deepening the zombies mode.***

Gamers, we have the ability to influence what we play. If you're actually interested in seeing this and have read this post, then vote it up! 

Edit 1: Include more than one mode. We don't just need survival! Other modes would give people more content to go through, along with new maps, and ***think about adding unlockables, like guns that people can unlock that they will start out with instead of a pistol.*** Nothing super strong, just something to allow them to have a little variety and work towards. Maybe they can bank points to spend on items for their zombie characters, etc."
yg5oy,0,2012-08-18,Med School Question,honestabe401,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/yg5oy/med_school_question/,"Hello Reddit,

I'm going into my 4th year in college as a double major in Nutrition and Biology.  I intend on applying for a Dietetic Internship, and becoming a Registered Dietitian.  In order to make myself stand out and get an internship, I volunteered at a local hospital, and in return, was allowed to shadow the Dietitians.  I really enjoyed ICU rounds with the Dietitian, to the point where I'm thinking about Med School.  I've been thinking about continuing on with my Dietitian plan, and once I start work, and can pay back some of my loans, maybe do some Post-Bac classes to meet any required classes I need/boost my GPA, then take the MCATs and hope for the best.  Some questions I have are:

1) What can I do during this time in the way of extra-curricular activities to make myself stand out? (On top of working as an RD)

2) What should my GPA/MCATs look like?  I slacked off quite a bit my first three semesters, as a result of not knowing what I wanted to do.  I've busted my hump the past three, and my grades are making a significant turn for the better.  My Cumulative GPA right now is only a 3.01, but I have two more years to raise it (it's going to take 5 years for my double major), plus, any post-bac classes I end up taking can potentially raise it.  Last term's GPA was a 3.6, the term before that was a 3.4, and the term before that was a 3.02, so my grades show a pattern of consistent rise.  I've heard Med Schools can forgive the toll on your GPA that a little screwing around freshman year can cause, and that consistent improvement in your GPA is highly appreciated; is this true?

3) How good will working as a Clinical Dietitian look on my resume?  The role of a Dietitian involves assigning tube feedings and intravenous nutrition to those in the ICU, analyzing lab results to assign proper supplemental nutrition to patients, creating meal plans, and educating patients about proper nutrition and meal planning.

4) How bad is the stigma of being a D.O.?  I'm leaning towards a D.O. school because they're easier to get into, look favorably on older applicants, and I've been told their training is better for the field I'm thinking about taking up (internal medicine).  Is the stigma going to prevent me from getting Residency and job opportunities, or has is mostly gone away?

Thanks for all the help fellow redditors, and if anyone has any other tidbits of help or information, it would be greatly appreciated!"

yfi58,1,2012-08-18,"Am I an idiot for turning down an intelligent, well-adjusted, gorgeous girl?",[deleted],AskWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/yfi58/am_i_an_idiot_for_turning_down_an_intelligent/,"Last year, a mysterious figure messaged me on LinkedIn and asked me to meet for advice her internship. She was in the same office building, but I had never seen her before and had no idea how she found me, but nevertheless, a cute girl falls out of the sky, surely I had to give it a shot. We met up and sat around for a couple hours chatting. I gave her my advice, but I could tell she was so advanced that she didn't need it. Impressive. The conversation moved onto interests: it turns out we both were struggling programmers (nerdin' out) and loved a few of the same bands. After we left, she emailed me a few books and Facebook'ed me a concert in the city. Feeling confident that she liked me and being the evil wannabe smartass I was, I decided not to show. Surely she'd change her entire schedule around and chase after me. Idiot. I briefly ran into her one more time before her internship ended, but she soon returned to school and the conversation went quiet. 

Fast forward to a few weeks ago. She's back in the area, we meet up for lunch and we pick up right from where it ended last time. She updates me on her life and we were both happy to see each other again. I invite her to visit my place and we both hang out for a while before I drop her off at home. She lets me know she that was going out with her roommate later that night. 

I didn't go. I texted her a lame excuse instead. I also let her know that we'd take a walk later in the week and just talk. She agreed, but our schedules never coincided. We both flaked and haven't talked since. She's due to return home, likely for the last time.

A little side note: Earlier this year, I went out with a couple friends to celebrate on a Friday. I blacked out, didn't remember walking back home, but also didn't remember that I ended up driving. I was pulled over, arrested, and charged with a DUI. I could have killed my passenger and others on the road. My family was severely disappointed. The lawyer fees and bills pile up to this day. I told myself I wouldn't drink again until the whole situation was over, and even then I think I'd be hesitant. 

I haven't told her about this, but I don't think there's a point in doing so. I've worked hard on improving myself in the last few years to a point where I honestly felt confident without a bunch of mental gymnastics, but now I feel flawed. She's a damn awesome person and I have the hardest time maintaining my cool around her (she briefly showed off her pipes and I nearly peed myself). I don't think I could ever let her go if we got together, but long-distance relationships have never been my cup of tea. Here's the part that surprises me the most - I really feel the happiest with her spending the remaining college years to grow as a person and figuring out more about what she actually wants in life. That's what I did. I want to see how far she can go - she's a fireball of passion towards her own education and career and I know she's on the road to something huge. I feel that I'd just keep her locked down, during some of the most precious years of her life, for my own needs. I know she probably thinks I'm an asshole now - but I'm okay with that if she moves on a wiser person.

Questions for you: do you think I'm being genuine or just making excuses for not going after her? Should I let her be, or not?"

I love him very much, we live together, and have a cat. We have discussed the possibility of marriage a few times, and I am pretty sure that this relationship will lead to that sometime in the future. 

However, lately I am worried. He has mentioned before that he wants to have kids, which I am fine with. I used to be apprehensive about starting a family and raising children (I was brought up in a fairly physically and verbally abusive household), but he has changed my mind completely about the idea. In fact, I really can picture myself being a mother someday, and will embrace that lifestyle... when the time is right. 

Boyfriend is a few years older than me, and is about to finish up school, has an AWESOME internship lined up, he's pretty much set for after he graduates to get a job (hopefully). I, on the other hand, didn't  really apply myself towards college until recently, and will not be graduating until I'm at least in my mid to late twenties. This isn't really a problem for me, because I am glad I got to experience working and living on my own first before applying myself towards higher education. 

But, my boyfriend has hinted/joked about having kids within the next 2 or 3 years. Which, like I said, don't get me wrong, I want to start a family with him, as he is a great guy and all. But I don't think I'll be anywhere near ready for a big step like that. I had dreams of getting my degree and having a career, and I'm terrified that it won't happen if children are factored into it. 

I suppose it's me being headstrong and putting myself first, but that's understandable though, right? My boyfriend will have HIS career, what am I supposed to do? I know that we are not even married, nor engaged even yet, but the things he says makes me worried. He says he is joking about the whole situation, but I'm starting to realize that he really is not; why else would he keep mentioning it, if it was just a joke?

I love this man very much, but I also love myself. What do I do? I know he wants a family very badly, within the next few years, but I honestly don't think I'm ready for that mature of a relationship yet, especially because I don't have my career OR degree lined up yet. 

Tl;Dr, boyfriend wants babies soon, but I'm not ready to give up my dreams for it. Help?"
yfc8s,9,2012-08-18,Getting started in Lexington,bolg,lexington,https://www.reddit.com/r/lexington/comments/yfc8s/getting_started_in_lexington/,"Hi redditors,
I am a young guy from Ireland who wants to live in Lexington when he graduates. I spent a summer in Lexington before but work was a little hard to find. I had no car either so that made things even more difficult. But still I loved my time there and loved everything about Lexington - even the crazy amount of churches (compared to Ireland).

I would like to move back as soon as my degree in Ireland is finished but I have pricing things up like a place to stay, furniture and all the other costs and it seems a bit crazy at the moment. Also, employment seems a bit rough there also. I have looked on careerbuilder and simplyhired but technology jobs don't seem to be plentiful.

I was wondering if you had any opinions and tips that might help this become a reality. I will be going over there on a J1 visa next year with a Bachelors degree in my back pocket. I also will have 3 years experience in an IT Helpdesk position and 7 months support experience (internship) with a major Software company.

Cheers"
yf0tl,1,2012-08-18,"GF (24f) is having issues with me (24M) hanging out with female friend I have known since college, is she justified?",incockneato,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/yf0tl/gf_24f_is_having_issues_with_me_24m_hanging_out/,"I met my GF about a year and a half ago and we started dating about 4 months ago.  It was a tumultuous start, but because she's so different and important I finally mustered up the nuts to make it work.  She lives with a female friend I have known since college who I am pretty close with but have NEVER had any feelings for, sexual or otherwise.

HOWEVER, there is evidence she may have had or has feelings for me.  She has admitted that she tends to develop feelings for her male friends, and I wouldn't be totally shocked if it turned out she did.

My GF, who is under a lot of stress with grad school and other related deadlines, told me that it bothers her a lot.  That when I am hanging out with my female friend, she pushes me away and doesn't want to talk to me.  I have told her that for me it is a non-issue, that I have zero feelings for the friend and that I am head over heels for the GF.

I said I understand, because when she would hang out with my best friend Fred, who she gets along really well with, I felt weird about it sometimes (knowing that it was my own issue I had to deal with)--to which she said ""well I don't wake up in your bed and go spend all day with Fred"".  There are occasions where I will spend a lot of the day with my female friend if GF is at school or her internship, but I never choose to hang out with the friend solely over the GF.

The GF is friends with my female friend, but not quite as close as I am.

Is the gf justified in how she feels?  Of course one cannot truly control their feelings, but what can I do to help alleviate her?  She tells me she doesn't want me to do anything differently.

TL;DR GF is stressed about the relationship I have with my platonic female friend from college and distances herself from me physically and emotionally when she knows Im hanging with her or having conversations with her.  Female friend could maybe, possibly have feelings for me.  How can I alleviate her stress and destroy this roadblock in my relationship with my GF, whom I love?"

yep4a,2,2012-08-17,"I (27 M) met a girl (22 F) who was working on my vacation; don't want to mess this up, but I may be over thinking this...?",NJSeoulman,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/yep4a/i_27_m_met_a_girl_22_f_who_was_working_on_my/,"[UPDATE] So I finally texted her very plainly asking if everything was alright, to which I received a message of, ""Yeah, everything's cool. I miss you dude."" I responded saying to hit me up whenever she feels like skyping. My old college room mate/best bud was around who I haven't seen in years. We discussed the matter to which he replied to me, ""You gave a girl your number, you never expected to do that right? You went to a club and danced with said girl, you never expected to do that right? You made out with that girl by initiating the make-out, something you'd never do, right? I'd say, look at it as a happy memory and a confidence booster. You got yourself back out there on the market and actually did something. Who cares if you never see her again, at least you did SOMETHING!"" It brought me much comfort and helped me look at things in perspective. I won't stress this out and if she does wanna talk, great. If not, then I'll remember it as a happy memory that helped me come out of my shell. It definitely bolstered me with a new sense of confidence. Maybe I'll go to the bar more often or the clubs perhaps. Thank you Allie for finally showing me that my previous relationship is over and to move on.


Strap in kiddies, it's my first post ever and it's quite a complicated situation. Let me start by saying please be gentle and I apologize if I sound like 99% of the other single men out there. First, a little history. If you want to get down to the brass tacks, skip to the paragraph that starts with a ***.
 
 
I am an adopted Asian American. My appearance is the only thing really Asian about me (and my love of video games). I've been told by multiple women that I'm considered very cute looking (I basically look like I'm 18, yet I'm almost 28!). Body type is not fat, but not fit. At a glance, I look like your average skinny Asian, at 145 lbs. and 5'8"". Despite hearing these positive compliments, I am INCREDIBLY SHY around good looking women and women who I find attractive. If I don't find you attractive, I am funny, charismatic, and confident. In my experience, there are very few women who are physically attracted to Asian men. If a woman likes me, it's solely based on personality.
 
 
As a result, I was unable to have a proper relationship until college where I lost my virginity to a girl my age (we were 20; the details of this relationship are irrelevant). However, I rebounded to another relationship with a girl who I had prior feelings for who we will call Lisa. After a year, my love for her waned and I wanted out. As fate would have it, I got her pregnant and was the one to take her virginity. We got an abortion, but she was devastated and it resulted in several more years of staying together (partly, because of my own self conscious being unable to do such a horrible thing to another human being). I grew comfortable in the relationship and figured this was what I deserved. It is important to note that I was not physically attracted to her, but we had so much in common it was as if our minds were of the same mold. We slept together (nothing sexual, just sleep!) every day at college. 
 
 
3 years or so into our relationship, she tells me she needs a break. Admittedly, I was being cold to her and not showing the same enthusiasm I did at the start of the relationship. I saw this as a blessing in disguise; this was my way out! We separated for 2 weeks in which I was reflected and looked back at all the good times we had; there were too many to count. 2 weeks later, I show up at her apartment with flowers and her favorite movie. She was so overwhelmed that she cried (and repaid me very nicely ;)). Over that winter break, she started to look depressed. As we were both graduating, I assumed it was because we would no longer be able to see each other every day and brushed it off. It was over a phone call that she sobbed to me saying how she slept with another guy and was going to break up with me after the 2 weeks. However, she said that because I was such a gentleman and treated her so well that she just didn't have the heart to say anything. At this point, I lost it. Suffice it to say, it did not end well and we have not contacted one another since. I regret all I have done to her and as a result, have not had a relationship since.
 
 
Fast forward 4 years. I am 27, single, no prospect of women what so ever. My mother even asked me the other day if I still liked girls. My friends are no help what so ever. They are in it to do their thing and get out. They have never had a real girlfriend. I, however, am not like them. My co-workers are the same and the married ones just bust my balls all day long. My one close friend (a virgin) invites me to go with his family to Disney World. It had been a while since I felt youthful and decided to go.
 
 
***We're in one of the parks. There's this log where you put your arm in and try to guess what you are feeling. My friend is afraid of spiders, so I plan a little joke. I stride over confidently saying there's nothing in there that can hurt you. The moment I put my arm in, I start screaming, ""AHHH! OH MY GOD! AAARRRRGGGHHH!!!"" and pretend my arm is being eaten. I notice there's several small children staring wide-eyed and remember where I am. I apologize profusely and explain how there's nothing in there that can hurt and I was only joking.
 
 
Enter the girl (we'll call her Allie) who was running the exhibit. She's an intern, so her shifts constantly change and she's rarely in the same place twice. She thanks me for traumatizing the surrounding children and insists that I now have to try the other holes and figure out what they all are. I do so and she gives me an educational postcard with a stamp on it. I laugh, thank her and leave to see the rest of the park.
 
 
It rains and we're caught under a cave of sorts. From a distance, I hear, ""I know you!"" Sure enough, it was Allie. We talk, some kids come through and I encourage them to learn from her. She was talking to me a lot, but it's Disney! Everyone is really friendly and talkative. It's her job to talk to people and teach them things about animals! As we walk away, we exchange first names and say what a pleasure it was to meet. My buddy tells me as we walk away out of ear shot that she was, ""totally hitting on you."" I haven't so much as talked to an attractive girl (of which Allie was) in such a long time, maybe I just didn't pick up on it. I say I don't have a pen and bam! Right in front of me is a pen and paper. I write my name and number and trudge back.
 
 
Feeling like a complete fool, I tell her, ""I was chided by my friend and his family for 10 minutes to give you this,"" and hand her the paper. ""We're here for the next few days, give me a call sometime,"" I say. As I walk away, I shout back, ""You know, you really are a cutie!"" She giggles and puts the paper away. I figure, at worst, she won't call and at least I made some attempt at meeting a female. I still feel foolish and embarrassed. I've never done this...ever!
 
 
Well, 4 hours later I get a text. It's Allie! She texts me that she's glad she saw me again and that she feels stupid for not giving me her number! We both were really excited to see each other again and have each others phone numbers. We spend the rest of the day texting each other trying to figure out a day to meet up and a little about ourselves. I ask her if she gets asked out all the time, to which she replies, ""Oh, yeah. I get tons of cute guy's numbers with my sexy vest and shorts."" We settle for 2 days later as she has a family reunion to go to. I text her telling her how cute and pretty she is (she's 22). She texts me telling me how handsome I am. I knew she was the one when she texts me this: ""Let's get down to the important questions...DC or Marvel?"" We gush on our respective nerdy interests and eventually wish each other good night. Face it, we were both infatuated with each other.
 
 
We set up a date to go dancing at a club. I'm a nervous wreck. It's important to note that I lost my voice that day from screaming on the Tower of Terror and I that I cannot dance. I dance like a white guy (no offense white people out there!). She shows up all gussied up in a white laced spaghetti strap top with short shorts and sweet boots; all dolled up with make-up and light perfume. I have no fancy clothes myself, so I wear a t-shirt, cargo shorts and sneakers. We each get a drink and go out on the dance floor, alone. I make a fool of myself, but she danced so well that I just went with the flow and did my best. We step outside to have a smoke and talk (with my voice cracking like a kid going through puberty). Despite it all, I discover that we share many similar interests and how she's actually into Asians! She's a sort of closet uber nerd I guess?
 
 
Several drinks later, and I'm dancing up a storm with her. The club was fairly empty and our dancing essentially helped to get some wall flowers out there too. We step outside again for another smoke and talk some more. At that point, I get up the nerve to go up to her mid sentence and kiss her. She receives me warmly and we proceed to make out. We dance some more, make out some more, drink some more. It was fantastic!
 
 
I get a little handsy during out make out sessions (I never do this...ever!) and ask her if she wants to go for a walk. We walk, talk, make out, and discuss how upset we both are that we don't have a bed to go to. We set up another date for the next night. She says she's going to ask her room mate to step out for a few hours so we can have some privacy.
 
 
In the morning, we wish each other good morning and she gives me her entire schedule of where she will be and at what times. I'm on cloud 9 at this point people. I manage to catch her twice (we can't hug or kiss while she's working; there's cameras everywhere!) over the course of the day and she's happy and kind as usual. We take a quick picture, so I have something to remember her by.
 
 
At 4 o'clock on her break, I get a text from her. She says she's so sorry, but has to cancel our plans. There was a family emergency she says. I reply that I'm sad and that I'll miss her dearly. She texts me her last name and tells me to facebook her, would love to skype, and will miss me very much. That was the last text I got from her that day. I was devastated. I was in a horrible mood the entire night. I didn't care that we wouldn't be able to have alone time. I cared that I wouldn't be able to see her again.
 
 
The next day, no word from her. At night, I text her that I'm getting on the plane and will miss her. I give her my wishes that her family is safe and sound. She texts me back a single sentence, ""I already miss you like crazy!"" It lifts my mood and I'm content with the short reply. I text back saying we'll talk all the time on facebook and skype.
 
 
I had work the very next day and end up gushing to my 33 year old married boss. My work place is full of all wise-guys who love break balls. He spends the whole day jokingly telling me that I'll never see her again. ""Haven't you ever heard of a summer fling?"" he chides. I play it off, but each time he says it, it cuts me to the core. I friend request her early in the day, but the mocking does not stop. I finally get the nerve to text her in the afternoon, ""Been at work all day. My boss is breaking my balls saying, 'You'll never see her again,' and, 'Ever heard of a summer fling?' I'm going to murder him!"" I notice she accepted my friend's request almost immediately after I sent it. I even sent a message with some small talk. However, no reply, no text, no nothing.
 
 
I've personally used the excuse, ""There's a family emergency,"" to get out of work, dates, etc. I can't help but feel like this is one of those situations. I can't help but feel like maybe she really just did think I was a summer fling and didn't want to get too attached, hence the reason for cancelling our second date. On the other side of the coin, what if she really did have a family emergency? Someone passed, illness, etc. all would shut anyone down from texting and what not. I don't want to be too pushy, nor do I want to look overly attached and scare her away. She's in southern USA and I'm in northern USA (about a days drive!). We never really established what we wanted from each other. We just talked about our similar interests and made out and danced! I figure to wait at least a week before trying to contact her again. I really like her and would love for this to work out. 
 
 
Oh! I forgot to mention that while we were talking at the club, she told me her internship ends in January. She said she was going to look for a job in NY. I asked why, to which she looked down sheepishly and pointed at me (that move really got to me, in a good way!). 
 
 
I'm a wreck right now reddit. Never before have I met someone who I was mentally and physically attracted to in a way like this. Help, advice, comforting, anything is welcomed. Remember, this is my first post and I'm sorry for it to be such a cry for help. I thank all of you who read my story and I'm sure many of you have gone through the same thing. Meeting Allie has shown me there are good people out there like me. Please help!
 
 
TL;DR: Met a girl who was working on vacation. We had the perfect first date, but cancelled the second one due to a family emergency. Is she trying to let me down softly? When should I try to contact her? I really like her and don't want to mess this up!"

In April I had a fantastic job with great pay, the prospect of a great place to live, and money in the bank. I go to school in the NYC area so I figured that I'd continue my happy situation and not go home (600 miles away) for the summer. When I first talked to my landlord he said that I could move in right after school got out, when the time came to move in he changed his mind and said that I had to wait a few weeks to move in, forcing me to move back home with all of my shit. Unfortunately, I had to quit my job because I was going to be gone for more than a week. My thought process was that there are a lot more job opportunities in the NYC area than where I'm from so I'd eventually find a job. At the time I had a great internship too.

I come back to New York, move all of my shit in and immediately start looking for a job. At this point I'm interning full time. A month or so goes by and I find this shitty, soul crushing telemarketing job where I was getting literally screamed at for using the bathroom more than once an hour. I continue this job for about a month until my grandmother has to have surgery. They wouldn't let me take time off so I quit. I'd rather be with my family when they need me than make a few bucks, I thought it was the logical choice, so I went home for a week.

That was about a month ago. I've been living off of 300 dollars for the last month.

The icing on the cake is that I live with a mega brat who I was originally sharing a room with and to make a long story short I'm now living on the floor of the dining room.


**TL;DR I've had a really shitty summer and I'm running out of money. I have about 200 dollars worth of bills to pay and a HUGE amount of school expenses coming up.**"
yhr55,1,2012-08-19,[m4w] - 35 and above.  Let's storyplay.,radlee,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/yhr55/m4w_35_and_above_lets_storyplay/,"You admire yourself in the mirror, as you smooth out your skirt. It's a smart outfit, a bit tight, but in all the right places. The first interview was a breeze, this one should be no problem at all. Your skills are finely honed, just a matter of impressing the potential boss, one Patrice Flanagan. You arrive 15 minutes early. In just 5 short minutes you are escorted into a luxurious office, and placed at the corner of a very polished, solid oak conference table. ""Just a few moments"" says the young blond that escorts you back. Have a seat. The view from the office overlooks the better part of the city. You lose yourself in thought when a hand is placed on your shoulder. The man stands there, his hand held out. ""Patrick Flanagan"", he says. ""And you are?"" You are momentarily confused ""I was expecting a Patrice"" you say. The man chuckles, stating that his name is indeed Patrick, and the young intern failed to correct this in her letter. Your eyes take him in. He is probably mid-40's, tan and trim, dressed casually, but expensively. You take his hand as you stand, and feel an immediate stirring inside of you, as you introduce yourself..... (more to come if you want to play, just waiting for your response.)"
yhlpu,5,2012-08-19,so hurt. Don't know what to do.,[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/yhlpu/so_hurt_dont_know_what_to_do/,"Background: I'm a 20 year old female, he's about to turn 22 in October. This is my last semester at community college before I move onto a university. I'm also pursuing modeling so depending on if an agency wants to sign me, I might have to put a hold on that. I've made decent success by myself though. He is a double major at a very good university near by. He had an internship with a HUGE company this past summer. He got paid $35 bucks an hour, full time job, long commute....doing the thing he loves to do. If he does well this year in school the company wants to hire him as a full time employee which means higher pay, a closer office to his house and multiple benefits.

So....this guy (M) and I have only been dating since the beginning of the summer but we grew pretty attached pretty quickly. We both have a long history of bad breakups. We both tend to get attached to someone who either doesn't feel the same attachment or tends to go and run off and cheat. As a result, we both have a decent amount of trust issues. We were working through them. We had a few fights because we deal with our breakups differently (I prefer to go and drop all contact, delete/throw away all stuff/memories, while he prefers to try and remain friends because he feels like it's a waste to have someone get to know him that well and not try to be their friend) which led to insecurity on both of our parts but that was about it. 

Thursday night we went to a party together with some mutual friends. While we were there he was telling me and our friends how lucky he felt dating me, how happy I made him, how he felt like I was the best thing that had ever happened to him women-wise. But then...he made a stupid comment about an ex when his friend asked about dating her. it made me jealous and upset. He tried to reassure me but I was pretty tipsy at this point and didn't want to deal with it at that moment. 

So the next day, we're all supposed to go to his aunt's beach house. We've been planning this for over a month now. He acts pretty normal through out the day. I text him asking him to come over before we're ready to leave because I want to have a talk with him about the night before. I guess he assumed I was going to be upset/yell at him/dump him but I just talked it over calmly. While I'm finishing packing, he asks me to sit down and he breaks up with me. He says he feels like the longer we stay together, the more we're both going to get hurt. That he feels like he's at a fork in the road, one is a decision that is easy, based off of emotion and care: being with me. Another is one that will make him miserable for a while but benefit him in the long run: not dating anyone until he's done with school. He chose the latter because he doesn't think he can balance school and a relationship. He's been in two long term relationships during the school year and they didn't go well. Both girls don't have their g.e.d/high school diploma and were very dependent on him. I'm not. But what happened was:

1.) The first one he got super attached to and neglected his grades to hang out with her and almost got kicked out of college.

2.) The 2nd one he did a good job on his grades but the girl ended up cheating on him because she didn't feel like she got enough attention.

I don't know what to do. I guess I'm still hoping he'll call me up and tell me he jumped the gun and made a mistake. School starts during the 1st week of September for him. He texted his mom telling her what happened and she told him that he was being an idiot (I'm the first girlfriend his mom has liked). I wrote a letter about my feelings on the situation but I don't know if I should send it to him. I don't know if I should try contacting him. I don't know what to do.

If anyone wants more details, just ask. I'm having a really rough time with this and my friend said the people in this subreddit tend to give good advice. "
yhb75,9,2012-08-19,[request] it's been a weird summer,[deleted],RandomKindness,https://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/comments/yhb75/request_its_been_a_weird_summer/," In April I had a fantastic job with great pay, the prospect of a great place to live, and money in the bank. I go to school in the NYC area so I figured that I'd continue my happy situation and not go home (600 miles away) for the summer. When I first talked to my landlord he said that I could move in right after school got out, when the time came to move in he changed his mind and said that I had to wait a few weeks to move in, forcing me to move back home with all of my shit. Unfortunately, I had to quit my job because I was going to be gone for more than a week. My thought process was that there are a lot more job opportunities in the NYC area than where I'm from so I'd eventually find a job. At the time I had a great internship too.

I come back to New York, move all of my shit in and immediately start looking for a job. At this point I'm interning full time. A month or so goes by and I find this shitty, soul crushing telemarketing job where I was getting literally screamed at for using the bathroom more than once an hour. I continue this job for about a month until my grandmother has to have surgery. They wouldn't let me take time off so I quit. I'd rather be with my family when they need me than make a few bucks, I thought it was the logical choice, so I went home for a week.

That was about a month ago. I've been living off of 300 dollars for the last month.

The icing on the cake is that I live with a mega brat who I was originally sharing a room with and to make a long story short I'm now living on the floor of the dining room.

**TL;DR I've had a really shitty summer and I'm running out of money. I have about 200 dollars worth of bills to pay and a HUGE amount of school expenses coming up.**"
yh7ks,12,2012-08-19,Budget Help.,ECUcurley,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/yh7ks/budget_help/,"Hello everyone, I know these posts are a dime a dozen and get old quick so I'll try to keep it short. I'm in north Carolina by the way.

I am currently a college senior working two jobs and I would like some help budgeting some stuff out. I work two network admin intern jobs one paying $15 an hour and the other paying $8 an hour. with school starting back up on Tuesday my hours will go down dramatically and I start working ~18 hours at the $15 an hour job and ~13 hours at the $8 an hour job. the higher paying job is about 30 minutes away and with my class schedule i can only work there after class Monday/Wednesday and all day Friday. while the other job is in town and I will work it between classes (i have about a 4 hour break between classes) but that's enough about that.

my monthly expenses are as follows:
rent: $375 a month (this includes utilities and cable/internet)
Car insurance: $40 a month
Phone bill: $50 a month
Gas: I drive an F150 that just eats gas like crazy and to get to the job thats out of town it takes about ~$12 of gas a day. (that's to get there and back) so about $120 a month if im strictly driving to work.
Food: I'm not sure how much to budget.

from the calculations I have done it looks like the higher paying job covers all my bills for the month with about ~220 left over for food, ect. That means the second job will be pure income and will come out to around ~440 a month.  

I have a decent credit score as well, around 740 if that matters.

All of this information to ask a few questions,
1. Given my income how much should i budget for food? its just me as my girlfriend and me live and buy our food separately.
2. Given my income and the driving requirements would it be in my best interest to invest in a more gas efficient car? I've been looking and have found some used 2008 Honda civics for example for around 7k asking price from dealers.
3. I also have about 9k in student loans from my four years here and will probably take on ~2k more. whats my best plan for these? start paying them now instead of getting a car? 

Sorry for the long post, I look forward to your responses! have a great day!

ygaqb,0,2012-08-18,Med School Question,honestabe401,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/ygaqb/med_school_question/,"Hello Reddit,
I'm going into my 4th year in college as a double major in Nutrition and Biology. I intend on applying for a Dietetic Internship, and becoming a Registered Dietitian. In order to make myself stand out and get an internship, I volunteered at a local hospital, and in return, was allowed to shadow the Dietitians. I really enjoyed ICU rounds with the Dietitian, to the point where I'm thinking about Med School. I've been thinking about continuing on with my Dietitian plan, and once I start work, and can pay back some of my loans, maybe do some Post-Bac classes to meet any required classes I need/boost my GPA, then take the MCATs and hope for the best. Some questions I have are:

1) What can I do during this time in the way of extra-curricular activities to make myself stand out? (On top of working as an RD) I already have track and field, along with volunteer experience with my church group during high school, volunteer work running a farmers market at a local hospital for charity, 40 hours shadowing the dietary department at a local hospital, I was just hired at that very hospital as a per diem dietary aide, and also have a work study program where I work at an after school homework club for elementary and middle school children.

2) What should my GPA/MCATs look like? I slacked off quite a bit my first three semesters, as a result of not knowing what I wanted to do. I've busted my hump the past three, and my grades are making a significant turn for the better. My Cumulative GPA right now is only a 3.01, but I have two more years to raise it (it's going to take 5 years for my double major), plus, any post-bac classes I end up taking can potentially raise it. Last term's GPA was a 3.6, the term before that was a 3.4, and the term before that was a 3.02, so my grades show a pattern of consistent rise. I've heard Med Schools can forgive the toll on your GPA that a little screwing around freshman year can cause, and that consistent improvement in your GPA is highly appreciated; is this true?

3) How good will working as a Clinical Dietitian look on my resume? The role of a Dietitian involves assigning tube feedings and intravenous nutrition to those in the ICU, analyzing lab results to assign proper supplemental nutrition to patients, creating meal plans, and educating patients about proper nutrition and meal planning.

4) How bad is the stigma of being a D.O.? I'm leaning towards a D.O. school because they're easier to get into, look favorably on older applicants, and I've been told their training is better for the field I'm thinking about taking up (internal medicine). Is the stigma going to prevent me from getting Residency and job opportunities, or has is mostly gone away?

5)  When should I take the MCATs?  I'll be quite busy my last two years of college, but I'm afraid that if I wait too long to take them, I'll have forgotten too much of what I learned.

Thanks for all the help fellow redditors, and if anyone has any other tidbits of help or information, it would be greatly appreciated!"
yg9bi,100,2012-08-18,Girlfriend redecorates apartment while I'm out of town,somanythrowaways1234,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/yg9bi/girlfriend_redecorates_apartment_while_im_out_of/,"So my girlfriend, 28, moved in with me 32, about 3 months ago. We had been dating since October and i decided to ask her to move in with me once her semester was over. 

I went to visit some friends out of town and left her here for 2 weeks. When I get back I discover she has pretty much redecorated my apartment. Shower curtain has been replaced, bathroom floor mat has been replaced, even trashcan in bathroom has been replaced. Kitchen has been completely reorganized, things thrown away and moved for no reason.

Posters taken down from wall, all new curtains everywhere. Best part is she put the living room rug, a chair and a empty keg outside of the apartment in the common area. The landlord decides to clean the common area and all of these things disappear.

I've been furious to the point of thinking about breaking up with her. This was my apartment, i have paid 100% of the bills, i pay for 95% of our expenses such as going out to eat, food and what not while she works a internship which doesn't pay. I keep telling myself i wouldn't have had a problem with this if we had moved into a place together and we were sharing bills but the fact that she blew all of this money on a bunch of things we already had while actively losing my living room rug, a empty keg and a chair both worth money(if i felt like parting with either of them).

It really kinda seems like a red flag that she would do all of this without my permission and then not even understand why I would be mad about it. This happened 3-4 days ago and I'm still mad that the apartment I've paid for is now no longer mine and that I've been basically supporting her while she is able to save up money and then she wastes money on buying things we already had.

I'm seriously thinking about just waiting till she gets home and telling her she has 7 days to find a new place to live.  

Am I in the wrong here being mad about this? Throwing a relationship away over curtains and a rug is pretty petty but the physical things are not the point, it sets a nasty precedent in the relationship that I can't decide how my apartment looks.

TLDR: girlfriend redecorates my apartment while i'm gone and can't even understand why i'm not happy about it."

""So, I'll this ex Chris. Chris and I have been dating for awhile. I was very happy, and so was he.

Today we decided to go out to lunch, but I had to stop by the mall to exchange some jeans my mom got me. We were driving to the mall and he mentioned he needed to talk to me. I ask him to tell me, and he says, ""The internship I have says I have to break up with you, and it's not about age like I thought, it's because you aren't a Christian."" (His internship is for a church by the way. And something he has really wanted to do...)

So, completely heartbroken I get to sit next to him til we get to the mall. And then spent the most uncomfortable hour of my life walking around with him, and him trying to comfort me, and another 20 minute ride home, where I gave him back his stuff.

I got home and started crying, only to realize I still had a few things of his. So, with my just-done-crying voice still obvious, I had to call him and have him come back to my house and get them.

So, in conclusion, I lost the happiest relationship I've had because I'm not a Christian. ""

I'd also like to mention, he told me the main reason he couldn't be with is because someone who ""isn't deep with God"" would bring someone who is ""deep with God"" away from Him.

I have NEVER done anything to pull my ex away from his beliefs, and he admits that, but fears I might. I think it's bull because I believe everyone is entitled to their own believes. I'm an Atheist. It's what I believe, but I would never EVER pull someone away from their beliefs, especially not the guy I was falling for. "

I am just overwhelmingly tired. Recently I took on a summer intrlernship a bit away from home. I don't really have friends here but I generally like the environment. 

Along with the regular interns, they also have a group of young new hires. I have done such a good job that they have permitted me to stay my last semester of school (all of my classes are online this semester) and join full time when I finish.

The issues I have been having are the same as highschool. I feel like it is impossible to make friends and like something must be fundementally wrong with me. It probably does not help that I recently broke up with my very long term boyfriend ( it was for the best). 

The issues I have been having at work is the fact that everyone seems to be so close knit there is no way 'in' among my peers. The new hires share a quad, there is no room for me, and I sit at a small desk outside a cubicle. They are all 21 and I am not (I have 2 months left). The majority of what they do is drink, and I can't. However they sometimes do non drinky things and I am never invited. I have no idea what I am doing wrong or what may be wrong with me. I am very nice, never have anything bad to say about anyone, and time permitting attempt to help anyone I can. I don't want to be a third wheel, and I have only asked to join once (they changed their minds and decided to drink instead). I dont want to impose so I only did that once. I just dont know what to do, I feel like if people are that dissinterested in spending time with me there must be a reason for it.

I just feel so lonely, I am working so hard/much I barely have time for myself, let alone to find new friends, and classes havent started yet.

I have started to have suicidal thoughts again. I havent had those for over half a year. I dont know what to do, I stay positive and pleasant, I help out and I still dont have friends. I may just be too weird for life."

I use Linux-based systems since this month- it started at begining at internship where I was testing application on Ubuntu. Than I was rellocated to Helpdesk where I saw and somehow used other distribution -Fendora, Xubuntu etc etc.

I really got fascinating how much this system is useful and powerful when it comes to administration. Anyway, I really would like to learn more and more of using it and even use it personally everyday- right now I use Ubuntu on my home PC installed though WUBI.

To learn more about that system I was thinking about trying [Linux From Scrach](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/).
And I have question: Is it a good way to learn more about this system or should I try something else?
My 'teacher' told me that if I'm so fancy to learn Linux I should try also different versions like Debian or Mandiva."

yjblb,2,2012-08-20,I'm new to SAP and don't know ABAP. I have a question regarding query reporting. ,chineseinamerica,SAP,https://www.reddit.com/r/SAP/comments/yjblb/im_new_to_sap_and_dont_know_abap_i_have_a/,"Hello experts,

I'm an intern at a small - mediean size manufacturing company. I started working on query reporting this summer using SAP. My company is not big and there isn't anyone who really understand ABAP proragmming. They bring in consultants from IBM from time to time. So I had to learn to do quereis all by myself.

At first I thought it was easy to do simpler queries as long as I find the correct tables but I kept running into problems. For example， I was doing a queries for finance department the other day to find the Purchase Orders with corresponding Check Numbers. So as usual I went on the internet and googled the correct table. I then did a query in QuickViewer and there was the coloum of PO was all blank while there were infomation on Check Numbers. This kinda of things happend many times that I used the right table ( or maybe not right) and all the needed field names were there but there just wasn't any data when the query comes out. 

Okay, maybe I'm not using the most correst terminologies but hopefully you understand what I'm saying. I understand that my company doesn't use all functions in SAP so some fields are naturally empty. However there isn't any data on some fields that I'm pretty sure the company is entering. 

I asked the finance people that  who were helping them with queries before because I was curious if he had the same problems. They said no one. Turend out my company started using SAP just 3 years ago. I feel like the SAP package my company is using is not that ""complete"" . 

Plese tell me what might be the cause of empty data? Is it possible that something was not connected in the backstage? Just curious. "

We have 20 lectures who will be teaching! updates are soon to follow tonight, telling you more about how we will run the course!

Note: sign up has began! Please sign up whilst course details will be published soon. You may sign up here: http://ureddit.com/

Hi everyone seems like the course will go ahead around end of September. Currently I do not have internet access so details will be made available in 5 days, if people are still interested.

 **IMPORTANT: Please keep track of this post as it changes often as interest and help increases! **

**NOTE: This is the newly added section! for all new comers please read below at ""Hello all,"" downwards! Use the find function (Ctrl+F) to find it as this new section will be quite large as time goes on!**


**IMPORTANT! if you are a graduate/PhD student, and currently are doing research or wish to teach, please contact me! Read below in this section under number 3 questions asked for more detail of what I am talking about!**

So as of now, I have 5 teachers (including myself), 1 part time, and 2 unconfirmed genetics teachers. 

The 4 confirmed teachers will all be teaching Neuroscience and their own subset, 1 confirmed teacher will give you the basics and specific of biochemistry (WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT! As understanding neuroscience requires understanding of some fundamental biochemistry!)

Hopefully the 2 genetics teachers will confirm, if so we have 8 in our team, if we manage to get 2 more we can make the videos every 3 weeks (obviously the timing of the videos will be spread out so every week there is something to watch and do!)

 I am still looking for more Genetics teachers &amp; biochem ones, though if you have expertise in neuroscience please don't hesitate to PM me!

one of the main question I get: 

1) How will we structure the syllabus? 

Right so, what I really wanted to happen was for us to cover theory and concept from the base upwards, and once people are up to speed (quite a lot to cover first, we will start at highschool level) they could enjoy and understand research talks from then on with some concept lectures, but please throw your opinion at me because I need to know what you guys think! 

2) I would definitely be interested, but how would this work for people who are not even close to Eastern Standard Time in terms of participation? 

The lectures will all be pre-recorded, with tutor sessions to follow, and dynamically changing lessons to help those struggling or to go faster!

3) Hi I am a researcher/graduate in (any bioscience) and I-

Hold right there! Are you interested in teaching?! Or giving a 10 minute talk about your current research? I am aiming to make a mix of concept material plus current research to students, and either way it would benefit this course! If you don't have much time, just a one off 10 minute video will do! If you are a redditor then you would know about IAMA, this would be sort of like IAMA, apart from you will talk about your research and the students will ask scientific questions regarding your research! 


---------

**Hello all,**

This is my first time posting on Reddit (been lurking for 1 year), I am an undergraduate neuroscience student, and I am also an intern at a chronobiology laboratory. I do understand my grammar is not the best, so do correct me if possible. 

**This is both a interest check, and also a check of what the community demands of me; to see if I have the time to commit to this (so nothing is definite as of yet).** I am doing this due to several reasons:

1. Personally to improve my English, teaching and communication skills, I wish to become a lecturer in the future, and this would be great on a CV too!

2. I am here because I would love to share some knowledge regarding what a lab life entails (as I believe it is not told to us properly at any stage of university/high school, leading to terrible assumptions of how science works and much more.)

3. To part my understanding of what I have read on articles, lectures and much more to people who are interested. I respect those who wish to learn, and understand. (Also to keep articles for those who wish to understand current affairs more accessible)

-----------

**What am I offering:**

I and several of my colleagues will be each individually teaching separate parts of this course; as the check count and colleague count rise, there will be more subjects and modules to follow.
(Note: Remember most of the courses are BASIC entry, so some complex details will be missed out to fit the BASIC courses, advance modules will be set out accordingly when I have enough help to do advance modules)

**The basics:**

**Genetics**: this includes what is DNA, importance of it, creation of protein, transcription to translation, promoters &amp; more.

**Neuroscience**: Basics of what a neurone is, function of neurones and communication between neurones.

**Chronobiology**: Basics of the genetics behind chronobiology in Zebrafish organism model, and possible implications, this is a relatively hot field in research.

**Possibilities/advance:**

There might be a possibility of adding more modules into this course as it gets larger, some include Basic entry **Psychology, Pharmacology and Biochemistry**. AGAIN, this is all just debate at the moment, nothing is finalized. And if anyone knows how to edit the thread name, please comment below :)!

**Subset of neuroscience**: The field of neuroscience is huge, and thus the course will fluctuate depending on the expertise of the group, but we aim to get people who are passionate on certain areas of neuroscience to teach you, and discuss what are the current affairs in that area. (**including neuro-imaging, neuro-cellbiology, computational neuroscience**)

**Biochemistry**: The works of a cell and more!

**Lablife**: little info on Lab life how research works based on my experience and others. Images on equipment and how they facilitate research will be added, questions will also be answered.

-------------

**How will the course be operated?**

I would give probably **10 minute video** lectures at a time for the basics, with some critical reading material (relating to how the field started/latest research on the field.)

The Genetics module would be more of a ""pre-requisit"" for the Chronobiology.

I hope to get some of my colleagues interested if they have the time, some of them are more specialized in bio-chemistry, others in imaging of neuroscience who can give better insight into that field. 

I have linked this page to a few of my colleagues, and I am thinking if we can get probably 5 or more to participate, we could spread the workload to about each person creating a 10 min video every **2 weeks (or every 3 weeks) (totaling 50+minutes every 2-3 weeks.) With some reading materials** to cover the rest of the downtime, more info will be posted as I continue to get more information. 

Thing to note about 10min videos, it will be condensed, so don't be disappointed if it weren't a 20 hour course per month (That is a massive amount of hours! :O) as I am sure the 10minute videos will be a lot in itself!

As far as which courses will be taught first, I think the basics of genetics and neuroscience first (or other per-requisites), then I/we will slowly start integrating lab life, current affairs and other courses. 

**Tutor groups will also be held in a subreddit** for students to discuss among themselves with possible lecturer to jump in and steer them in the right direction for each video session.

**Research talks** I aim to bring in people from different labs to talk about their work once most basic concepts have been taught, relating concept with research material, these will happen as one off 10 minute talks.

-------------

**What makes us difference from generic Youtube videos online?**

So some people have personally asked me what difference is this compared to some of the Youtube clips already online? Well, there are three parts to this question I like to mention:

1. Typically the Youtube videos are quite scattered, it would be nice to organize it into a condensed form in one location, easy to browse and find.

2. It will be tailored to make it an access course for complete beginners to (and this is the crucial part) understand current research and affairs, making it much more understandable how research works and why they are doing what they are doing.

3. Final is to add relevant reading material (current, and old), such as understanding the reading material (if it were old material).

-------------

Final note: In no way am I senior researcher etc, I state again I am an undergraduate Neuroscience student, but I am happy to learn and part as much of what I have learned to anyone who is interested, both for your gain and mine, this is also a learning curve for me, and a great opportunity!

It was my senior year and her junior when we first got together. She had broken up with her ex boyfriend about 6 months prior to us first hooking up. She would always tell me she didn't want a relationship, yet she would do all the things that you would do in a relationship with someone. To me it always felt like she was more afraid of the label rather than actually being that way with me. about 5 months in, we broke it off because she freaking out about her life and how she thinks that she wont have enough time for us to be together in order to fulfill her girlfriend duties. I told her it didn't matter to me, as long as she still tried to work me into her schedule as best as she could. She still didn't think it would work so we broke it off. After about 3 weeks of no talking to each other, she called me sobbing asking for me to take her back. Everything was fine and i finished my senior year, graduated, and got a job in the city and she went away for the summer. All summer long she would text me saying how much she missed me and how much she wished she could be with me instead of in the place she was in. 

About half way through the summer she switched to a new city with a bunch of friends to start an internship. The same behavior continued, but i will say i feel died off a little bit in enthusiasm right before the end. Then about 2 weeks before she came back she was super excited to be with me and i equally couldn't wait to see her. Finally last week she came back to finish her senior year of school and we spent the night together and everything seemed fine. But then all of a sudden she did this total 180. The day after she wouldn't talk to me, just short replies and nothing that would constitute trying to converse with me. I asked her what was wrong and she tells me she is freaking out about the up coming semester and that she doesn't think she is going to have enough time for me. She also says she feels weird. Weird about being back, weird about going back to school, weird about us. She then told me that she doesn't know if she loves me anymore. She doesn't know what or where she is going in 9 months once she graduates and it scares her that we might have to break up then, and she would rather do it now then then.

I reacted to this by telling her to think about what changed. If she doesn't love me anymore i would rather not be with her, and that i think we should spend time apart. She said she isn't sure and that just because she says she doesn't know, doesn't mean that she doesn't. I just hurts to hear that from her. She wants to try and fix it but this isn't the first time she has gotten so freaked out about everything. The last time was that three week break and she just called me begging for me back. I don't know what to do, it's really tolling on my emotions when she does this stuff, and just the fact that she even brought up the idea of breaking up bothers me. She says her head is telling her to break up with me, but her gut says stay. I don't know how i'm suppose to react to that. After we had this discussion, she came over and we just acted as if nothing was wrong and had sex. Then she went home and now she is sparcly talking to me again. I don't get it! Any ideas or stories of past experience or girls points of view would be super helpful. If anyone who has read this far has any further questions id be more than happy to answer them. I just don't know what else to do, so i turn to you internet. 


EDIT: TLDR: My Girlfriend of over a 14 months says she doesn't know if she loves me after 4 months of long distance, but was fine about everything up until she returned."
yj33o,3,2012-08-20,Help me(22) deal with my abusive and meddling mother(50) who is affecting my marriage.,helpmeout920,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/yj33o/help_me22_deal_with_my_abusive_and_meddling/,"Throw-away account.

Throughout my life I've been emotionally, verbally, and physically abused by my mother(now 50). She is extremely controlling and often uses the Bible as her defense for me having to follow every word she says because ""people who don't listen to their parents go to hell."" I've never realized how often and how much she abuses me until I lived away from her for a short period of time doing an internship and then coming back home. We've had plenty of fights in the past but this last one has been the biggest so far.

I'm married and my wife(20, we've been married since January of this year) and I(22) had a little fight. She and I were both upset and she decides to go into our bedroom which is right next to the living room. I'm browsing the internet in the living room because I want to cool down before I go into the room and talk to my wife.

All of a sudden my mom shows up and asks where my wife is and I tell her she's in the room. She goes into the room and not one minute later she comes out telling me I need to get up and go into the room and talk to her. I tell her I have things under control I'm going to go in there soon and talk to her. My mother says ""No, you go into that room right now and talk to her."" I tell her, ""Mom, I have things under control. I know what I'm doing. I'll go into the room and talk to her soon."" She says, ""Why don't you go into the room now? Is it because you're on the computer? Is the computer more important than your wife and your marriage?"" I tell her, ""That has nothing to do with it. Her and I are just cooling down right and and we are taking a small break from talking to gather ourselves better. Let me take care of this myself. Thanks for the advice."" She then gets extremely pissed and starts with her abusive ways like telling me this is why I never should've got married and that I've never grown up and never will and this proves it. I keep tell her I have everything under control and I ask her to please stop it. I told her, ""I'm married and I'm and adult and I can handle this myself. Please leave me be.""

She then threatens to unplug the router to cut off the internet. I ask her why, and she says because I need to go and talk to my wife. I tell her not to unplug the router and to please let me handle it. I say, ""You always say I'm not mature and I'm not an adult, but the way you're acting is not allowing me to be an adult. You're trying to force me to go into there instead of letting me handle the situation."" She then again repeats that I'm not an adult and I never will be. I tell her basically then I'm done talking to her about it and I'm going to handle it my way. I don't respond to all the threats and abuse she keeps yelling at me.
She then goes to the router and unplugs the internet while shouting, ""this is my house! This is my internet! I'll disconnect this if I want! This is not more important than your wife! Go talk to her!"" This is when I get mad. I asked her many times to let me handle it myself, to stop, to let me do this on my own, and she wouldn't let me. I start yelling at her and swearing and say stuff along the lines of not letting me do my own things. I was mad, but I just sat there on the couch as I was shouting. She proceeds to start telling me to ""shut up."" I tell her, ""oh now you want me to shut up? I asked you lots of times to leave me alone and you didn't. Why should I shut up now?"" I then tell her, ""this is how you handle things? When you don't get things that you want you abuse people and control them? First a couple months ago you grabbed my laptop out of my lap (she grabbed my laptop right out of my lap because I refused to argue with her and leave the living room) and now you unplug the router because you want to force me to go do something that I am in complete control of?""

We yell at each other. She ends up yelling at me, ""Thats it; I'm going to disown you."" And I was like, ""yeah whatever say whatever you wan't it doesn't even matter."" She then says she's ""going to tell my dad about this,"" and I say go ahead. Tell him how I asked you countless times to leave me alone and you didn't.

After she walks away shouting whatever the hell she was shouting, five minutes later I go into the bedroom and have a simple conversation with my wife about the issue we had. We resolved in no less than two minutes and we hugged and kissed and smiled. No issues at all. It wasn't a big deal at all. She heard me and my mom yelling but she is a more timid person and couldn't hear very clearly so she didn't want to interfere and make it worse.

Anyways, I'm completely aware of my mother's abusive ways but the thing is I have no idea how to deal with it. I'd love to move out of the house but I'm married and will be graduating next semester and I have to live in the house. The thing that erks me now is that she is getting into me and my wife's affairs and I feel as though she is only going to try to make things between us not work. My wife was telling me about once when she was out with my mom that she was just saying negative things about me. My mom even told my brother that ""I was being mean to her"" over this incident and now he won't even barely talk to me because he always takes her side and I'm sure she made it out to be that I was the wrong person.

What do I do? I'm sick of my mother and I honestly don't even think of her as one anymore. All she ever does is be abusive towards me and forces me to do shit I don't want to do. How do I deal with her? How do I keep her from meddling with my marriage?

**TL;DR: My mom has been abusive my whole life and I've dealt with it, but now she is getting in the way of my marriage and I don't have any respect for her whatsoever anymore and don't consider her as a mother. Leaving the house is not an option for at least another 5 months. What do I do and how do I handle it?**"

yiiup,13,2012-08-20,Not even worth a cutie mark if I could get one,FUS_ROH_yay,MyLittleSupportGroup,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyLittleSupportGroup/comments/yiiup/not_even_worth_a_cutie_mark_if_i_could_get_one/,"Enough with the throwaway account...I might as well use what courage I have to put this under a name some people might possibly recognize me by.  This'll get long...feel free to skip it if you have better things to do; I just need to vent...and I also apologize in advance for any foul language I might spew onto this post...

Have you ever had someone say they love you, only to recognize that for all they say it, it's complete bullshit?  I get that feeling from my family, even my own parents.  Seriously, it's been a week since I came home from my summer internship and I already can't wait for university to start back up.  Heh, imagine younger me hearing that I'd be *looking forward to school* and would even prefer it to summer vacation.  It's at that point where I just want to be back already.  How do I tell my family that if they treat me the way they do now, I would rather not go on the 2 week cruise they're planning for the Christmas holidays?  I don't know where I would go, but even if it were just staying at home taking care of the dogs it would be better than being stuck with them.

I may be 21, but I still get treated like a little kid.  When my mom isn't saying I'm fat in oh so many words when I've managed to lose 5 pounds in the last 2 months (not like I was even that fat to begin with...), she's yelling at me for doing/not doing something whatever the situation may be.  When she's not doing that, she's blaming me for something I literally have no control over (sorry mom, but I can't be using up all the bandwidth when my computer isn't even turned on!).  When not that, it's something else incredibly pointless.  My grandfather is a bit better, but he doesn't seem to get when he's taking a joke too far...quite frankly it's hurtful when he keeps saying the things he says, even though I know it's a joke deep down.  

This isn't the first time they've driven away members of my extended family; I had an uncle living in the same city as my grandparents for 16 years and I only met him when I came down to visit a year or two ago...all I had known of him before that was a Christmas card.    My mom half-jokingly suggested I wouldn't want to visit them based on the way I reacted to the sudden announcement we had changed our typical plans for going back to college to include flying out of the city they live in instead of driving the whole way.How do I tell my grandmother, the only one that will give me a chance at being an equal, that I'd almost rather not visit them if it meant the difference between seeing my parents or not?

---

As for *why* I want to go back already, I'm not so sure...  The only reason I'm keeping my major is because I'm a senior...to change now would be stupid as I'd be pushing off graduation for several years just because I don't like what I'm studying.  I have become disillusioned with politics; this, despite writing a modestly popular political blog whenever I had the time to do so and choosing this university because of its political science department.  I realize that there's no real future for any of our generation...at least, not for several years if we're lucky.  

As part of one of our many fights, today my grandfather and father asked me what kind of example I would want to set for the kid behind us at mini golf.  I honestly couldn't answer...I just have no faith in humanity as a whole.  How do you tell a kid that unless he manages to get extremely lucky, he's going to be screwed by the system during the best part of his life?  ""Don't study anything that isn't math, engineering, or something required to get to math or engineering classes if you want even a snowball's chance in Hell to get a job?"". How do you tell him that despite all the words thrown around on tv and in the news, ""hope"" and ""change"" don't exist?  Though there are some places on the internet that are friendly and welcoming, the vast majority of it will not hesitate to tear you down?  For fucks sake, I'm only 21 and a friend has said I have what looks like a thousand-yard stare.  This plus how my childhood has been has convinced me that I don't want kids of my own, causing some friction with my girlfriend who wants a house full of the damned things; never mind the fact that she has outright said she's done dealing with my ""issues"", which I can understand...I stared at my iPad for 2 hours trying to decide whether to even post this.

---

To top it all off, I feel like I'm not particularly good at anything.  I've got a 3.45 GPA overall, which just isn't good enough for my parents to accept, and I did so poorly on the LSAT that even if I wanted to go to law school, all that would be open to me are the ones that don't get you a decent job in the legal profession afterward.  I can sing decently enough, but there'll always be someone much better; even if I were the best at my university, or even in my year, it doesn't pay the bills anyhow.  All my results in Internet marketing, perhaps the one area I might be able to make my way in the world in, are terrible for landing a job...the internship this year was forgettable, and the one that I did really well in 2 years ago isn't around anymore to provide a reference. Never mind that marketing is supposedly one of the most competitive fields to get into; it's almost like I would be better off standing on the corner of a street singing whatever I felt like - except oh wait, I can't accompany myself worth a damn unless it's with my iPod.  I just look back on my life so far and see so much wasted potential...I could have been good at something, but it just didn't work out...I've bumbled along for years being mediocre at best, and now it's crunch time and I'm the one left holding the bag.

I've thought about running, just leaving it all behind.  I don't know where I'd go, what I'd even do.  I'd just get away from it all, hopefully forever.  I mentioned it before once or twice, but I came close to killing myself a year ago...*oddly enough I don't feel like doing it now*, but I just don't see the point in continuing as I have been..."

Going through college, I worked up in Alaska in the summers and generally favored working my ass off and getting out of college debt-free. Because of all of this, while I have professional experience with just about everything short of legal counsel and medical practice, I have little that exclusively pertains to computers. With the resulting void in professional experience, the jobs I have gone after have yet to produce any positive progress. I'm beginning to think that some devious life-nemesis is appending horrid obscenities to every email I send, actually.

  I've spent about 2-3 hours a day for the last probably 5 years working on a variety (Web/ Embedded/ Client/ Android) of projects to keep myself entertained and upbeat, but it seems that most potential employers I've interacted with don't seem to care about non-professional experience. 

   Keeping all of this in mind, am I on the right path by just keeping to learning on my own and hope the tides change in my favor? I mean I'm all for a period of poverty that will likely come from taking an internship right now, but honestly my car doesn't like to be lived in, and stealing wireless when nobody uses WEP anymore is difficult. All of that, and I don't want to ponder affording lunch over crossing 520 at rush hour... I've been advised to find an open source to get in on, but I have difficulty finding the right way to approach such a vector.

Please help.",The_Wind_Fish,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/yi091/messed_up_but_dont_feel_the_punishment_fits/,"Throwaway, but frequent helper on r/relationships. I value much of what is said here, aside from the people who don't seem to see it from others' point of view. The ""just break up"" or ""just talk"" ends of the spectrum are seldom the solution, and are often easier said than done (if they are). So please, I appreciate any help in this matter, but try to see this from my point of view.

My girlfriend [18] and I [20] have much history for youngsters. We've been dating for three years, and they've been the happiest three years of my life, and from what I can tell, hers too. It's tough since I'm younger than most of the to-be college seniors, but we've managed to stick it out despite the hour-long distance between us. Over the years, I've felt nothing short of happy to remain entirely loyal to her, tell her everything, be honest, push away drunk college girls, and in general be the best boyfriend I can be. I certainly felt the same effort from her. We both slipped up from time to time. Nothing big, but it seemed like it was more often on her end. Things that she did weren't always socially acceptable in my eyes, but we got past it.

The most shining example of this would be this Spring, when she took another guy to her senior prom, despite me voicing my displeasure. I tried to talk to her afterwards and explain why, but she still didn't see anything wrong with it, and considered the talk to be a ""lecture"". Nonetheless, I looked past it and followed my rule of ""forgive, but don't forget"". About two months ago, I got off work (as a summer intern) early and went to her work to give her flowers. She works at summer school as a volunteer. I brought them to the front desk and asked if they could give them to her whenever she was available. They insisted I bring them to her directly and promised I wouldn't be intruding. I walked past the immature high-school asshole guys who teased me, and stopped at one of the rooms where they called her out and I gave them to her. She asked what I was doing and said she couldn't take them. The boys in this class taunted me. ""Ohh! Rejected!"" and she went back into the classroom to assist the teacher. I walked home and gave the flowers to my mother. I was on the edge of my comfort zone, and she rejected me.

Needless to say, many of my friends and family told me to break up with her. There were suspicions that there was someone else. There was a period of time, maybe three days, where I didn't talk to her. She tried apologizing, she tried making it up and sending me messages, leaving me voicemails about how much she cared. It helped, but I just needed a few days to let it cool down. In that few days, I did something I'm not particularly proud of. It wasn't terrible as far as I see it, but it was still wrong. I flirted very strongly with another girl, an ex. It was mainly a trip down memory lane, remembering the good times. She was having guy issues, and I reassured her she was a very nice, smart girl, and that she'll find someone, etc. I even invited her to come to my campus and watch me play for the school's soccer team. Nothing involving taking action, but many compliments floated around, much speak of the good times, and things like that.

A few days later, I cooled down and realized it would take a lot more than that to get me to break up with my girlfriend. She's the perfect girlfriend 99.9% of the time (don't get the wrong picture because I'm only telling you negative things, we have had AMAZING times). I intended to stick out and ""forgive, but not forget"". The previous incident was fairly unrelated, and as long as she learns that it bothers me, it was worth it.

Two months fast forward (last week), and she tells me she logged on to my facebook account and read the message with my ex. She tells me that she can't believe I'd do such a thing, she's shocked, she can't look at me the same anymore. I tried to explain to her that I never intended anything to happen, that it was when I was very upset, and that I honestly didn't feel like it was that terrible. I agree I probably should have told her. I messed up. But for the past week she's been acting very cold, saying it's just not the same, etc. The last I heard from her, she needed time to figure out if we should stay together or if it's best for this to be the end.

It's tough to tell this series of events in a way that justifies us staying together, but these events recently aren't her usual self. I've never gotten the idea that she's unhappy with me. We're sexually active, we still go out and do exciting things, we know each other better than we know ourselves. I don't feel like this is worth a breakup. How can I show her that I won't do that again, other than by telling her? I've been extremely nice to her this past week (back rubs, candy, hair brushing, etc), but still getting the cold shoulder. This ultimatum period is making me fear she'll make an unfair choice.

**TL:DR - Flirted with ex on Facebook while mad at gf, nothing *too* terrible. Gf logs on without my knowledge, reads convo, and can't seem to forgive the action, despite similar actions from her in the past, and three great years of a near-flawless relationship. How can I make her see this from my point of view (that a breakup is a bit rash) and show her I won't do it again?**"

Today, student debt now exceeds $1 Trillion and over 50% of new college graduates are unemployed or working in jobs that do not require a degree. While criticism of our educational system is warranted, the pragmatic option for individuals is to seek growth outside of the schoolhouse.

I aspire to provide custom tailored lessons aimed to provide a holistic survey of skill sets relevant in today's economy by stressing the union of traditional curricula, practical experience, and passion. Some specific skills not taught in most high schools include:

* College Physics, Math, Chemistry, and Engineering
* Principles of Entrepreneurship, Business, and Investing
* Computer Programming: Excel, MATLAB, C, Java
* Research / Resource Facilities
* Civil Liberties and Law
* ACT / SAT / AP Preparation

These skills will be developed through custom multidisciplinary projects. Ideally 2 or 3 students will work together to accomplish a goal, and naturally the programs can take whatever focus or structure you desire. Classes can be held in a public library or setting of your choice. Example projects: 

* Build an electric guitar while studying music theory and acoustic physics
* Develop a small business plan (rental property, online business, or restaurant)

Here is my abbreviated resume. Resume and recommendations available upon request.

* Naval Nuclear Physics Instructor __________ 2011 - present
* U of Illinois Physics Teaching Assistant _____ 2008 - 2011
* Illinois Ski Club Treasurer _______________ 2010 - 2011
* High School AP Physics Internship ________ Spring 2010
* U of Illinois Research Assistant ___________ 2009 - 2010
* Small Restaurant General Manager ________ Summer 2008

The services I am prepared to deliver are worth about $75 an hour. However, custom lessons are a new venture for me. My first client is worth more than cash. If you or your children are interested, let's discuss.

As a young adult myself, I have found these skills to be of substantial value in college and in the job market. Grades must be accompanied by a unique set of experiences and by passion to stand out among peers. I aim to help satisfy these qualifications.

Thank you for your time!  I hope this isn't seen as spam advertising.  Any thoughts Charleston?  I appreciate any input!

yls6r,1,2012-08-21,Looking to buy a used 2004-2008 3-Series. Budget is Less Than $20k w/ Extended Warranty. Live in NoVA. Can I get some help? I also have some questions!,[deleted],BMW,https://www.reddit.com/r/BMW/comments/yls6r/looking_to_buy_a_used_20042008_3series_budget_is/,"Hey /r/BMW!

**Just some background info about me and some other stuff:**

**I know very little about cars.** **I want something sporty, stylish, and fun. BMW fits all of those.** The 335 is too expensive for me, can't find anything sub $20k. I will probably put a couple thousand down and hopefully get my monthly payment less than $300. 

**Are the 3-Series fun to drive? I don't care about how fast, just how smooth it is.** I also care about how comfortable the care is. I love the exterior on the 3 Series. I am sill in school but I can afford it with my new Part-Time job and my dad said he'll help me some. 

I worried a lot when trying to find a car and the thing is **I don't know ANYTHING about cars.** I am VERY willing to learn just by browsing reddit I have learned quite a bit, but not much. **But I have settled on a 3-Series BMW.** My dad said he'll also teach me, he is able to do oil changes and knows quite a lot. The more I know about the 3-Series will allow me to be more confident when talking to the dealership.

I am a social person and used to work in sales (retail) so I can definitely negotiate prices and what not. **I am going to buy at a dealership and not individual seller.**

**For a second car I think the BMW 3 Series is pretty good. The standard interior is perfect as long as it has an AUX cable.** If not that's fine I can use a Jabra Bluetooth FM Transmitter it works very good and sounds just like AUX cable and noticeably better than any other FM transmitter. 

The second major factor in deciding is the **sound system. I could care less about how loud it is, just need the quality to be good.** I looked at the 330ix (or xi?) and they have pretty good sound system. For example, I loved my '01 Odyssey and it's sound system. I got it as my first car with my first job while still in school (luckily lived near my top choice public university, it saves on Room and Board). Although I paid some for it, my dad paid for most. Was only a couple thousand. My dad recommended it as it's safe and reliable. But unfortunately it's falling apart. I haven't been in any accident or gotten a ticket in 3 years since I started driving, it's just getting old I guess. The A/C hardly works, the front bumper is falling off (my fault, I don't judge properly when I park and sometimes go too far ahead &gt;.&lt;). It's getting bumpy and the steering wheel vibrates constantly and feels loose, my rear headlight cover broke (cracked) (my fault again &gt;.&lt; hit my trashcan). But for 1 year I've tried as hard as possible and haven't put a scratch. *It's nearing 180k miles with the transmission changed at 165k.** I am significantly more careful and don't make the same mistake twice. I think I'm responsible and quite careful I just make minor mistakes. My sister used it for a couple of weeks when she didn't have a car a year ago during the summer. I didn't need it at the time (no job) and and unfortunately she put A LOT of scratches/dents because of accidents and I wasn't able to afford the repairs. I got angry obviously, she didn't destroy it but **looks horrible now,** I actually liked the outside of the car. **To get the car in better condition is going to cost me thousands of dollars,** it's almost junk I can't even trade it in or sell it on craigslist. **I can manage if I HAD TO and keep driving it like I have been for months, but it hurts me inside now to drive it and other people seeing me in it.** The only thing I look forward to is the audio system. Yes, it passed both safety and emissions inspection recently. **If there a cheap methods of removing dents/scratches please let me know.**

**Anyway with the Odyssey's audio system I'd get this ""submerged feel.""** I don't think it's stock but dealer upgraded, not sure anyway what kind of sound system it is. **I compared it to my Sister's '11 Camry and Dad's '09 Accord and Mom's '12 Acura MDX and thought my Odyssey's sound system was better. I might be crazy, I don't know.**

**I'm getting a new (used) car since I got a really nice $18/per hour job part time 25 hours a week.** It's inside and it's basically an internship. It is going to be quite a lot of work. I'm really happy since it's also the area in which I want to make a career for myself in, plus they're flexible with my school hours. I'm rewarding myself with a cheap used BMW. I still live with my parents and probably will for at least 3 more years, MAYBE more. I'm still dependent so I'm grateful since I do not have to worry about Health Insurance, food, shelter, etc... My dad pays most of the bills I only have Car Insurance, Phone Bill, Credit Card Payments (if any), to worry about. I don't go out much, only fun I have are video games. **I managed to make a budget and found out I can still spend $500 a month if I work 20-25 hours. I don't have to pay for school I got quite a lot in grants and the tuition isn't that much. I am taking very little in loans. I also managed to save a couple thousand over the past 4 years of working, I started working at 15.**

**I think I should be okay for a used 2004-2009 used BMW 3-Series with 50-100k miles for $10-15k w/ Extended Warranty, mechanic check, and other fees so about $20k total maximum.** With student discounts I have a low car insurance compared to my sister, still higher than my parents. I can't get the ""good driver"" discount yet because I haven't driven enough apparently. 


**Sorry about the long rant I enjoy typing a lot.**

**I'm not sure about the models, there are just too many. Are there any substantial differences?** **Also what's the difference between e36/e46 or those specific models I hear a lot of you talking about it.**

**What I'm looking for in the 3-Series car/dealership:**

1. **Really good sound system** (Can get it installed as well if need be, I get discounts for installation and sound systems through a friend).

2. **Is decently fun to drive.** I'm not sure what fun is when driving a car, can someone explain to me a little bit. I drove my dad's Accord v6 it's quite fun. My sister's Camry is a little less fun. The acura MDX is also fun I guess. My opinion is that as long as it's smooth it's fun to drive. Which currently my Honda Odyssey isn't smooth lots of bumps, sounds, and vibrations.

3. **Handles well.** I love going fast on my Odyssey at 70 or 80. But I can tell it's not handling well. I only do it at night and will NEVER go above 80. I make sure I go that fast on a highway and when there are no other cars. The Odyssey has good acceleration. I can't compare it to anything though really besides the Camry and Accord. Parents won't let me drive the MDX on the highway or at all since I'm not on the insurance or something like that.

4. **Very comfortable.** I am a big guy around 260lbs and 6' 4"" Odyssey is good in this respect as well. I don't prefer leather over the standard. I haven't test drove a BMW before so I'm not sure how big they are. I don't have that much time to go to dealerships right now since school is starting and I'm starting my new job soon. I need to make a decision on the internet and narrow it down to 3-5 cars and have a mechanic take a look at it before I make a decision so it'll take at least a couple of weeks.

5. **Good A/C.** I sweat a lot quickly if it's too hot.  

6. **Good looking interior.** Navigation is totally not necessary and plus most of the 2005-2007 models have VERY, VERY outdated ones. Might get a new one installed if I'm REALLY interested and find a good price. But to be honest my smart phone can do anything a pre-installed navigation can do.

7. **Good warranty.** I am going to make the investment into an extended warranty because frankly BMW's can cost a fortune to maintain. So I'm hoping to get a 100k/5-year warranty with almost everything covered. Unless you guys really don't recommend it then I won't get it but to me on paper for a 2005-2007 car it looks worth it whether or not it's CPO or not.

8. **Good financing options** I'm looking for a max $250 per month with a 60 month option. Maybe more, but gas will also increase due to premium unleaded, although I do get BJ's/Costco gas always. **Is my monthly payment unrealistic?**

9. **Is safe/reliable**


**Just some other questions:**

1) Will the dealership let me take it to a mechanic and get it checked out? How much does it cost to get it checked (probably depends right)? 

2) Can I buy an extended warranty from a BMW dealership?

3) What should I check for when I go to test drive it?

4) What are some questions I should ask the dealership?

5) Is buying the CARFAX worth it?

6) What should I be wary of? I understand that dealership sometimes and might trick you.

7) How do I make sure I maintain it and what are the costs?

**TL;DR: Just read the bolded parts. I am doing this in order get you opinion. Try to think of as many pros and cons of my decision. If you can please answer the questions and share advice that would be extremely helpful for me.** I'd really like /r/BMW's opinion on this because I did as much research as I could and thought a lot about this. To me it feel like a good choice I just want YOUR opinion.

**EDIT: If you could also help me find one near 20171 in Virginia or if anyone is around the Norther Virginia region. I also looked on various dealerships and at cars.com. Will post 5 cars if you could tell me basically Yes/No.**

Thanks!"

I returned home, on time, in June and I'm so happy things turned out the way it did.

I found out who my true friends are. I got closer to my family than I could have ever asked for. I finally have built up the courage to get a tattoo that represented the quote that got me through my internship.

yko85,10,2012-08-21,"I just feel stuck, and I don't really have someone to turn to",hyoorist,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/yko85/i_just_feel_stuck_and_i_dont_really_have_someone/,"I don't know where to begin (though that makes it sound worse than it is), so I guess I'll just list away. One of my least favorite things is to sound whiny, so forgive me...

1. Acne. Oh man, oh man. It started pretty typically, got horrible around the age of 16 (I'm 17 now, fwiw). I went to see a derm in March; it's late August now, and I've been on Accutane for roughly two months. If you're unfamiliar with it, Accutane is basically the final boss of acne medications; almost sure to work, but equally likely to make your life a bit less pleasant while you're on it. The chapped lips I can deal with, the muscle pains are forgivable-- but its also been correlated with depression, and I have to wonder if it's compounding all of my other worries and making me depressed. The worst part is the scars and red marks left after. You most often see people walk away from Accutane with porcelain skin, or nearly so... that won't be the case for me. Given all the time treatments take and periods of rest are necessary between them, I might have normal looking skin by, perhaps, my sophomore year of college. That's not a pessimistic estimation, I assure you. I expect to spend at least the rest of high school consciously thinking about my face every time I talk to a new person. Oh, I also have the concern of long-term Accutane side-effects hanging over my head-- if this shit gives me Chron's, I'm gonna be pissed.

2. This pain in my goddamn left nut. Sometimes it migrates to the right. It honestly makes me wonder if my test levels are affected, and it makes me feel like less of a man, silly as that may sound. The reasonable solution to this would be to go to a urologist and find out what the hell is up, but I feel so guilty about my mom spending money on the derm and other things (more on that later) that I just don't want to ask. She knows it's there-- or, at least, she knew it was there... it's been there since December. I think I might need surgery that we can't afford.

3. I am stuck on a girl I've never talked to. Seriously, does anyone have a solution for this? She's in the grade below. Not a bombshell, but cute, a really excellent writer... my type. She goes to my bus stop during the school year. Given the state of my confidence, for aforementioned reasons #1 and 2, I can't bring myself to talk to her. I'm not an inherently ugly guy, but I sure feel like one. I think about her too much.

4. I just finished this art class at the local community college, hoping I could take the class for credit and take more preferable electives my senior year of high school (we need art credits to graduate). $700.  Got a B... which will only bring my GPA and class rank down directly before college admissions. Looks like I'll be taking art classes senior year, and my mom's down over half a G. It also made my summer that much less enjoyable, but that's not what my real concern is.

5. Per the title, I'm stuck. The acne and all its remnants will take time; the pain, I don't know when I'll tell my mom about it; the girl, not with this level of confidence; the art class thing has just left me in a depressing rut. If I tell my mom I'm depressed, she'll instantly take me off Accutane, and the derm would do the same. Really, the only thing I'm enjoying right now is seeing my acne shrink away. So, five days from now, I'll go to the derm for my monthly checkup and inevitably tell him and his nurse that I'm in a state of perfect mental. I also like my internship and the volunteering I do, so that's good. But I'm just lonely. I disabled my Facebook for some time to see if I could force myself to be social; it didn't work. I haven't hung out with one person this summer. I feel like a loser. I got some good books from the library today... I figure if I'm going to go into cocoon mode, I may as well try to be productive in my doing so.

Wish I could say that's all (my laptop currently only functions with a MacGyvered clip, and it's only a matter of time until Mom sees/finds out about that and gets pissed, for one), but that's the worst of it. I can't help but think I'm being a self-important drama queen, but I think I have reason to be less than content with life. 


Oh, turns out I also write too much."

I was leaving to go on an internship in may for 3 months. Before I left, we spent about 3-4 days a week together. I still hang out with my freinds n do other stuff. We have fantastic sex. 

Before I left, told myself it was gonna be okay, only about 14 wks. long story short, during my trip, we talk maybe couple times a week(3-4) and skype once a week. 

Sometimes when we dont talk and I am not busy, My head kinda goes crazy..sometimes i get that sinking feeling in my stomach. Other times are not as bad. It feels like bipolar(never had it, but i can only imagine). 

thought it would get better when i see her in person, not by much, she picked me up from the airport when i got back and got a loft, we stayed together for about 5 days together. During the day, I go out and run errands, but we slepted together at night. At the start, i felt a bit of resistance from her, and it made me feel terrible. 

At the end of the stay, things kinda got back to normal i guess.. I donno, but the thing is.. when I am around her, I am quite cheerful and happy, but when Shes not here, its like a strange sense of loneliness, I have other stuff to do, and meet up with freinds n stuff... its just she isnt here, and my mind sometimes drift away thinking about her. I kinda just want to do stuff with her... on a very frequent basis. Its almost a bit possessive, and there is a bit of jealousy when she goes out n do stuff..also she gets hit on quite a bit.. so I feel somewhat insecure about the stability of the relationship. 

Is this thing I feel normal? Or am I just crazy in the head? Also How do I stop this?! 

** tl;dr** Been dating for 5 months, want to do stuff with her all the time, feeling like an emotional rollercoaster in my head."
ynikt,1,2012-08-22,Buying a Macbook Pro!,Copephobia,applehelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/applehelp/comments/ynikt/buying_a_macbook_pro/,"I've been working at an internship for the past 6 months and have been given a macbook pro to work with (but not keep). It's a 13-inch Mid-2010 model (2.4GHz Core2Duo, 4GB Ram, ~250GB HDD). I primary use it for Virtual Machines and programming, but will occasionally sport a game or two in Windows. So I am heading back to college at the end of the month and would love to have a macbook to use. (I currently have a 17.3-inch HP laptop that is quite sluggish).

So I decided that the minimum specs are as follows: 15-inch screen and 8GB Ram. Yay for minimalism!

In terms of buying a macbook pro, I've come across two paths: Buy a 2012 MBP and do upgrades myself, or buy the retina MBP and be finalized there.

What I'm really looking at is around 2.6GHz CPU, 16GB Ram (For multiple VMs and many tabs in chrome), and at least a 256GB SSD. I prefer to have a laptop start up quickly or more space, and 256 would be enough.

Resolution wise, I do love a lot of space to work with, so I would go for the upgraded 15"" (1680x1050) or the retina display. Either would work I suppose

Price wise, I'm looking to spend between $2,000 and $2,500. I couldn't see myself spending $500 on the 512gb SSD upgrade, but I am content with the money to upgrade from 2.3 to 2.6GHz and 8 to 16GB Ram.

So what should I look for?"

yn50k,5,2012-08-22,29 years old - Newly single - Good job/career - Want to blow it up and start over... A rant,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/yn50k/29_years_old_newly_single_good_jobcareer_want_to/,"Well, I'm just going to let it all rip here for the fun of it...

I'm the youngest of three boys from a single mother in New Jersey. I've always been the ""baby"" of the family and I grew inherently passive over my upbringing, just letting life happen to me and letting others dictate things. In school, I was an underachiever... Intelligent but lacking motivation and having a wandering mind. School didn't interest me. I went to college for Radio/TV/Film thinking I could make it big in Hollywood or something. I soon lost that motivation but finished the degree anyway. Around that time, I traveled around the country in a van with a friend which was probably the most fulfilling thing that I've done in my life. I saw a lot and it furthered my interest in moving away from my home and my family where I felt my growth was being stunted by own inadequacies. I took an interest in a girl from a message board that I frequented and we talked for years and I ended up going out to meet her in her home of Iowa. This continued for a while until I eventually moved out to Iowa to escape my home and fall in love. This was at age 22.

In Iowa, I worked for a data entry company and worked part-time as a film critic. I got promoted after some time and started establishing a life with the girl I loved. We moved in together. I bought a house. Life was good. I felt guilt for not being close to my family but I liked my life and met a good friend out there as well. After living in the house for a short time, the girl I was with decided she wanted a career change and wanted to pursue a degree in Deaf Education. She knew I may be happier being a bit closer to my family so we looked at schools in between Iowa and NJ. We settled in Ohio. I put my house up for rent and off we went. This was around age 25.

Once in Ohio, I found temp work at a medical school working in their Admissions Office. She started school and life was well-and-good. We had some tough times where we slept in separate bedrooms but we were still best friends and always toughed it out. However, we didn't have friends and started to become increasingly codependent. I started to like my job and ended up pursuing a Masters in Higher Education Administration (paid for by work). The girl went off to do an internship in Kansas for four months at one point. I surprised her by driving out and proposing to her. We started planning a wedding. I finished up my Masters degree. A year and half later, we had a wedding. I got a promotion at work and adult life was beginning to take shape. This was at age 28.

Within the year of getting married, my boss left work for another opportunity and I got another interim promotion to become the Director of Admissions... quite a good gig for a 28 year old. Something didn't feel right in my life though. My marriage was ""fine"" but not exciting. I started to notice other girls and had ""grass is greener"" thoughts every now and then. My wife didn't seem happy either. We had a talk where we admitted that we weren't ""in love"" with each other. We started planning a separation but insisted we would remain friends. It was impulsive (as most things have been for me, if you're following) and probably should have required more thought. This was two months ago.

She has since moved in with friends from school. She has been talking to an old high school flame who admitted his love for her. There is distance between them (he's in Iowa, she's in Ohio) but they seem to have a growing relationship. I feel a bit of anger about that... to know that he's always been lurking and now he's gotten her attention. It's been tougher to maintain her friendship and rely on her for support as I'm struggling right now. I went on a few dates with someone from another department at work. She started to fall for me and admitted strong feelings for me. I freaked out and have backed away from that because I didn't have similar feelings. 

Now, I'm kind of left without my best friend (wife) and stuck in a place where I don't have any friendships or long-lasting ties to anything. I don't want to go back to NJ because I don't have a desire to retreat back to that old life and I'm still thinking that the only way I can grow is if I'm not in that passive role of ""little brother"" back there. But, I have no idea where to go from here location-wise and don't think I'm strong enough to just move to a new state by myself without my wife. At this point, it just sounds best to live in a travelling RV where I can go from city-to-city and see people along the way. Of course, how would I work and make money while doing that? I don't know.

I want to start a new career because I just don't feel fulfilled in my growing career, despite being in a really good spot for my age. Every day I think up a new wonderful idea about what I should do but nothing sticks. College professor? Work in statistics? Work in psychology? Work in counseling? Work at an art college? Go back to get a doctorate in... something?! It all sounds good but it's all different directions and would require a firm commitment on my part to start a new life which is tough to do at age 29 when I've been on a completely different path for the past decade.

I just feel directionless and spinning and like I can't figure out what I want my future to be. I'm trying to volunteer more and get guitar lessons and try MeetUp groups and just try new things but nothing is fulfilling me yet. I'm also doing counseling which is nice but isn't necessarily providing me direction aside from making me realize that I've been passive (and not assertive) my whole life and that my family wants to help me and that I may be depressed.

Anyway, I'm obviously not writing this to seek answers because I don't even know what answers I seek. I just wanted to write it all out to help make sense of the mess that is in my head. Thanks for listening, if you made it this far. It at least helps to throw it all out there!

yn4sj,7,2012-08-22,"Facing an increasingly impossible situation with seminary internship. Could use advice, prayer, support, etc.",UberNils,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/yn4sj/facing_an_increasingly_impossible_situation_with/,"Okay, so I'll try to keep this as concise as I can. I'm a seminary student, and part of the ELCA's Seminary program is a year-long, full-time internship at a church congregation. I moved to start mine about four weeks ago. Each church who takes in an intern pastor is typically required to provide housing and a monthly stipend for living expenses. 

We discovered about a week after we moved that something was making my wife sick. She and I have been together for about two and a half years, and we just got married about three months ago. My wife has a few environmental allergies, but the two worst ones are cats and mold. She started getting sick a few days after we'd moved into the church parsonage, and the symptoms seemed to point to something allergy-related. We determined that there hadn't been any cats in the house for a long time, so that left mold. The church ordered an air quality report, and the results from the report were that there was indeed mold growing in the house. While the levels weren't high enough to cause issues for most people, they were bad enough that someone with a particular sensitivity could have issues. Ta-dah.

So, the church had a couple companies come in, look at the house, and put together estimates on cleaning up the mold. One company came back with an estimate of several thousand dollars, well outside what the church is able to spend. The other company came back and said that in their opinion there really wasn't any work to be done.

So now I'm in this kind of impossible situation. The second company is still going to submit an actual estimate, but there's no guarantee it will be any more feasible than the first. The pastor is talking with me about leaving the internship and finding a different site (the program is administered through the school, so they'd be in charge of finding me a new place), but that has serious risks involved - I need the stipend and a different site may not be able to provide one, and it would also mean my wife would have to leave the non-ideal-but-honestly-pretty-decent job she found up here and go back to the drawing board looking for work again. She's a certified teacher, and those jobs are really difficult to find this late in the year.

I'm just feeling incredibly lost and frustrated. Ever since we got married, and even before, we've been hit with a seemingly never-ending series of bad news and crappy situations. We've both been constantly stressed and anxious, and the first few months of marriage have been pretty rough as a result of it. We were really, really hoping that coming up here would be a good way to get a fresh start and really come together to build our life together, but it's not really shaking out that way.

I wish I could understand why crappy stuff like this just keeps happening to me and my wife, but I don't know what's going on with it. Every time it seems like things might be finally clearing up, some new development comes out that puts us back to square one. We haven't gotten more than a moment's rest and comfort all year, and I'm starting to second guess my entire career path at this point. I hate being one of these people, because I always feel like it's bad theology, but I can't help but wonder why, if God wants me to be a Pastor, I'm not getting a little bit more support and help. Both my and my wife's families have been supportive, but she and I are still just barely making it as it is, and there really doesn't seem to be much of an end in sight for all of this.

So, I don't know...I guess I could just use...I don't know. Maybe I just needed to vent. We're meeting tonight with the pastor and the Executive church council to talk about the best solution, but I don't really see one. I don't want to live apart from my wife for our first year of marriage. She can't live in a house that's going to make her sick constantly. If we leave this internship there's no guarantee that we can find an alternative that would be feasible. It's a crappy situation with only crappy solutions, and I don't know what to do.

At any rate, thanks for taking the time to read, and if you wouldn't mind sending a little prayer our way, we'd really appreciate that too. Thanks.

tl;dr: on internship to be a pastor, wife can't live in church house, church can't afford to fix house issue, don't know what to do."

ypv5f,12,2012-08-23,"I'm a young in-house IP attorney specializing in anti-piracy and content protection at a large media company, AMAA",lemonader,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/ypv5f/im_a_young_inhouse_ip_attorney_specializing_in/,"Hello /r/LawSchool!

I mentioned in the comments to a post on another subreddit that I work in-house for a media company and [ThebocaJ](http://www.reddit.com/user/ThebocaJ) sent me a kind message and suggested I do an AMA for any aspiring entertainment/IP and/or in-house lawyers out there. 

For reasons that are obvious to all of you who have taken Professional Responsibility, there are certain things I *can't* divulge, so I have to make this an ""Ask Me *Almost* Anything.

Questions I'm afraid I won't be able to answer:

* Anything that would identify the company I work for, including (obviously) its name and its involvement in ongoing/past litigations or public campaigns. Though I can say that you've all definitely heard of it. 

* I can speak generally about my personal experience and the type of projects I handle but I can't discuss confidential details about our business and legal matters. 

* Whether we are hiring. I know a lot of you are probably looking for jobs and I'm sorry I won't be able to help you on that front. I can, however, do my best to offer advice on landing a job in IP/entertainment law and/or with an in-house law dept. 

I will do my best to answer all others but I ask for your understanding if I'm unable to give you the type of detail you're looking for. 

Here's a little bit about my background:

* I didn't always want to be a lawyer. In high school I decided I wanted to work in sports/entertainment and that's always been my primary passion over law. I am a good writer and I talk a lot so I figured the legal field might present a good ""backdoor"" opportunity to get into the entertainment industry.

* I graduated from a pretty decent state college with a BS in Sports Management in 2005.

* After graduating college, I worked full time for a couple years for a small sports/entertainment agency and then a finance company.

* I graduated from a not elite but pretty reputable private law school in 2010.

* I have been with my company since September 2008. I started as a part-time enforcement clerk for the Intellectual Property group of our law dept. while I was going into my second year of law school. It wasn't an internship (I got paid an hourly wage) but it was intended to be a semester-long position, and before I got there, my group would just keep hiring a new law student each semester. Recognizing that I was gaining tremendous experience at a great company, I just kept making room in my academic schedule for the 25 hours per week position and kept asking to stay on each semester (working full time during the summer between 2L and 3L year) until I graduated. 

* When I graduated I was hired full time and promoted to an administrator position. My supervising attorneys were kind enough to let me take time off to study for and take bar exams. 

* In January of 2011, shortly after I was admitted to the bar, I was promoted to an attorney role.

* I specialize mainly in anti-piracy and content protection but also handle certain trademark enforcement matters and other projects related to copyright/trademark.

* I know diddly squat about patents. 

* I was not top of my class. I don't remember my exact rank, but I'm pretty sure I graduated in maybe the top third (but definitely towards the bottom of it). I was on a journal and I did write a note but I did not get published during law school (a paper I wrote after law school did end up getting published by my bar association's entertainment law journal though). I was also the president of my school's entertainment and sports law society and a member of the IP law society and the dispute resolution society. For both the entertainment law society and the DRS, I competed in some ADR competitions including a pro sports association salary negotiation/mediation/arbitration competition.

* I love what I do. I never take for granted that mine is a ""dream job"" and that there are thousands of much more qualified lawyers chomping at the bit to take my job, and I work hard to keep it. 

* I'm not sure if this is true for everyone, but in my experience, law school barely prepares you for law practice. I learned way more in the first 2-3 months of being a practicing attorney than in the entire 3 years I spent at law school.

* I am licensed in two states.

Finally, because my work schedule is pretty busy, I won't be able to answer all of your questions right away so please be patient with me and I'll do my best to get to everything. 

OK thanks everyone!"
ypq7e,18,2012-08-23,About this idea of plastic/printed Guns,[deleted],guns,https://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/ypq7e/about_this_idea_of_plasticprinted_guns/,"So i feel like i should start this with my credentials, and my anti-credentials.  
**Credential:** I am currently pursuing my master's degree in mechanical engineering, and have done internship work for NASA, the DoD. I am a machinist (over 2 years of experience) at my school's shop and routinely work on projects from nearly every department.  
**anti-Credentials:** my experiences with actually shooting guns are limited, i am book smart about them, and thats it, im currently trying to get my license (NJ, FML) but until then ive only gone shooting a few times.

Now onto gun materials, there are two huge red flags that go up, that i want to address here, first is plastic, and the second is printing.

1) **Plastic:** Nearly every material has a purpose, niche or wide, it has things its good at and things its bad at. Plastic, by definition, is a chemical polymer, with high deformity to force, relatively low melting points and high ductility. A gun, is prone to huge forces, high heat, and friction. A plastic under these conditions will melt, bend, lose form, and degrade very quickly. Quite honestly any gun made of plastic could *at most* be made to shoot one round, because you would have a mess of plastic in your hand after that.

Think about it, the important parts of a gun are made of steel, stainless steel, or other stronger metals. How often do you see a gun barrel made of copper, or tin? never, because they arent strong enough, these *metals* arent strong enough, by weight or volume to be usable. The thickness of the barrel needed with these *metals* would make a ridiculously heavy and unusably large gun. Imagine how a plastic gun would need to look? unless you intend on shooting 1mm rounds, or shitty plastic spears that go 2 feet, and only use cold propellants like a rubber band, this isnt going to work with current materials, or if it does, its going to kill its user.

2) **3D Printing:** Lets pretend they made a plastic that is hard enough to withstand the forces of firing a round, and is somehow (magically) able to be melted for printing but not melted by the heat of firing a round. You cant 3D print a gun because of the grains. The most common way (basically the accepted norm) of making any pressure holding part of a gun is to cast it, usually cast steel.

The reason they do this is because it minimizes the grains to, if they even exist, microsized turbulent grains, and because cast steel crystalizes. What does this mean? think of grains like fibers in a piece of clothing. if something wants to get through the clothing, it needs to be able to wedge itself between two pieces of fiber, so small fibers require something a hell of a lot smaller than coarse fibers. Also, a grain is a place where the steel is its weakest, (its easer to go between fibers than break through a fiber) and the smaller they are the less of an impact this has. On top of this cast steel tends to have more turbulent grains, so even if you can jab something between the fibers, you need to weave though, similar to why bricks are laid with the grout never forming a strait line vertically.

And crystallization is the optimal formation of the molecules, and forms the strongest bond among them. Which is why cast steel is used, its strong as fuck, can be used to form rough shapes to be machined to the exact dimensions needed. 3D printed material (especially plastic, but really ANYTHING printed) has massive grains in the order of 100x-1000x the size (and thus weakness) of cast materials, and has no crystal structure since the material isnt allowed to cool ""naturally"" but in the order it is printed. and even if you manged to print in a way that has a crystal structure and had small grains, you cant print with turbulent grains.

Just take the barrel, if you print it with the grains parallel to the barrel, then when you fire the barrel will peel open like a banana, but if you print it with the grains perpendicular to the barrel, you will get in barrel ridges which will make shooting as accurate as being blindfolded and drunk, and then will blow open leaving you with a coild of plastic that was your gun. Now even if you alternate parallel and perpendicular printing with inner hexagonal structuring (strongest tessellated structure) the gun will simply slowly degrade, every shot destroying a layer until it just falls apart, and thats in the ultimate special condition that basically doesnt exist, (kind of like physic's frictionless surfaces).

**TL;DR:** you cant use plastic, or 3D printing to make a gun, so using plastic *and* 3D printing is not going to end well.

Now at the same time i do want to say i am very much for the progression of science, but im for the progression for the sake of accomplishing something. Even if they manage to make a plastic 3D printed gun thats usable, they havent added in anyway to the world, because the gun will still, and always be sub part to a cast steel gun. any design they could possible come up with could be applied to cast steel which would be better by nature of the materials. And price cant even be an issue here, because even if they manage to make a design, the hardware needed to pull off the level of accuracy could better be invested in a 5 axis milling machine which would do everything a 3D printer could, but with more accuracy and better materials.

just want to throw my thought on the printed gun thing, shed some light on it, and why people should stay away from it if it does start getting sold."

yo46e,4,2012-08-22,I would appreciate some advice; ,mathstudent57721,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/yo46e/i_would_appreciate_some_advice/,"I am a University of Waterloo Student entering my 3B term. When entering university, I knew I wanted to study math, but I never really thought about what I wanted to specialize in or what I planned to do after. I took as many Pure Math Classes as possible as well as a handful of statistics courses.  

In the fall 2011 term I finally chose my major, Mathematical Finance [which is jointly offered by Pure Math and Actuarial Science] with a minor in Pure Math [there was overlap in the courses which made this very practical]. ""PMATH 450: Lebesgue Integration and Fourier analysis"" is only offered in winter terms and ""PMATH 451: Measure Theory"" is only offered in fall terms (and requires 450) and both contribute to my major and my minor, hence it made sense to switch my co-op stream so that my next coop was in the summer 2012 rather than winter 2012 (waterloo students normally alternate between school and coop placements over 4 month intervals). When I switched my coop stream I created a spreadsheet of what courses I want to take in each of my terms, and I found that I would be able to complete requirements for all of Majors in PMath and Math Finance as well as Minors in Statistics and Actuarial Science. 

A course parallel to the syllabus for Exam FM/2 - ""ACTSC:231 Mathematical Finance"" was also a requisite for my major. I didn't put any effort into the course, at first expecting it would be much easier for me than say PMATH 450, later never making an effort to catch up, and so I failed it. I am retaking the course this fall. The repeated class did not significantly impact my plan of classes since I (luckily) had exactly one extra course outside the union of all the requirements for the above majors and minors (after moving some classes around too).

During my coop term this summer I decided that I'm interested in pursuing a career as an actuary. Having taken several statistics and probability courses at university, I did not need to learn the material for the exam, I just needed to practice getting correct numerical answers with an approved calculator. I bought the adapt package in May and reached the maximum [earned level](http://www.coachingactuaries.com/FAQs.aspx) before my P/1 sitting on July 22nd. I finished P/1 with an hour to spare and unofficially passed. 

I bought study materials for FM/2 and began studying the next day. Im going through it tediously, doing every reading and every practice problem, just to be sure I dont miss any thing, but I study almost every day so im progressing pretty quickly. If I keep up the pace studying for FM2 (which shouldn't be hard considering it follows a class i'm repeating starting in september) I can write it in October. 

I've done very poorly in my required computer science classes, having made almost no effort in any of them. We studied Scheme then C. I am not bad with computers - I've built more than a handful and Im a wiz on excel and other microsoft office software.

I always have alot of trouble finding coop positions. Employers can see our grades when we apply to jobs posted through the university ""JobMine"". last term i had only 3 interviews and none in the first round. I always take whatever I can get because I never get a competitive number of interviews. In the end I found a position with the Project Management department at [Hydro One](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydro_One) where my role is mostly sharepoint design, creating sites on the intranet to streamline certain project management processes. This is my 3rd coop. My previous two have been a data entry at [Rogers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogers_Communications) and customer/technical support at [KineticD](http://kineticd.com/). I return to school in september and the job search process begins again.

From what I've read having an actuarial Internship greatly facilitates entry into an actuarial career.  Considering I've failed the course equivalent to FM/2 and have not had great marks in my compsci classes, what can i do to increase my odds of having an actuarial internship for my next coop term? Note that the bulk of coop jobs will be offered before October and so it will not be possible for me to have even an unofficial fm2 by then.

yrzbo,6,2012-08-24,Intentional Organization and Cleanliness,swinebone,infj,https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/yrzbo/intentional_organization_and_cleanliness/,"I've lurked on this sub for quite a while and have always enjoyed the conversations. It's odd to finally hear people talk about what I think and feel like every day and actually be able to sympathize, but at the same time it's refreshing. 

In that vein, I wanted to post about one of my most recent experiences and get feedback. I'm in the middle of getting my Masters in Social Work and last semester I really felt like I fell off the proverbial wagon. I didn't eat well, didn't clean up after myself, and procrastinated excessively. Looking back, I think that was my reaction to being overstressed and overworked. 

Over the summer I was diagnosed with Adult ADD and Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and while I refuse to label myself I will admit they seem to give me some piece of mind. 

But anyway, I've been making an intentional effort to stay organized and clean lately. I've separated my class and internship into two bags and I'll only need to move my laptop back and forth. I took an hour the other day to input all of my appointments and requirements into Google Calendar. I've also set aside two hours every week to clean my apartment. 

I've begun to understand that my natural habits seem to make 
me messy, unorganized, and habitually late. Personally, I've found that the best antidote to that is to schedule out everything I can so I don't get overwhelmed. It also reminds me to get back on track when I'm daydreaming or procrastinating. This does make me think I will run the risk of becoming unbending or controlling, but we'll see. 

Does anyone else feel that they have to be cognizant about their actions throughout the day in order to be productive and effective?"

My questions regarding this are (and hopefully people who have owned both can comment):

* Which would you prefer?  
* To me, it seems like they would be equal on the SSD and RAM front, so the difference would be Sandy Bridge + 6770m vs. Ivy Bridge + 650m - is that difference substantial?
* 15"" vs. 17"" - Is the difference noticeable?
* Peripherals: Getting rMBP over 17"" would make me lose expressCard, one less USB port, no firewire, no ethernet (without adapters) but will give me HDMI, SD Card slot and two thunderbolt ports as well as two USB 3.0 ports.

The pricing on these works out to about the same for me, so given the options - which would you pick?  Please let me know if I've left anything else out.  Thanks for helping out a confused college senior!"

My friend Cherise advise me to come to the Reddit community for help.

I am a Second-Year Bio Major attending Touro College. I have been looking for a doctor to shadow since, first semester. So, I resorted to look for Shadow opportunities in Mexico and Canada, since doctors are more willing to let Students intern with them. I found a surgeon through a friend of mine in Biology II. My friend has interned with him twice. To be precise my friend is the nephew of the surgeon. Dr. Alvarez, has been practicing Weigh Loss Surgery for 15 years. 

I would like to eventually specialize in Minimally Invasive Surgery. Since my school does not have an extensive Pre-Med Department, I have no choice but to look around for opportunities. I want my CV to look great, and I want a chance to get into Medical School. Its hard, when all you have is GPA and MCAT scores. That just gets you in the door. Shadowing, Interning, Volunteering, and Research would get me into the Med School of my dreams. 

I started communication with him, January 2012, and I have visited his practice in April, June, and recently two weeks ago. On the last visit, I asked him if he would be willing to take me in as an intern for Summer 2013. He said, yes- and even put a little cash aside for travels. 

So now I am here raising funds for my trip. 

PLEASE! Understand that the money is not for the Internship. There is no charge for coming into his practice and Interning-Otherwise I would not be here ""spanging"". The money will help me with my trip from New York City, to Mexico(Flight from LaGuardia, to Dulles, and Bus from Dulles to Coahuila), hotel, travel to and from the practice to my hotel, food, and water. 

All donors, will have access to receipts, if requested

You can call or text my google voice number @ (646) 580-8675. Gimme some time to respond to everyone. 

Thanks everyone for the help...If you can't help, then please spread the word!

So it's been a slow week at my internship, and I have a couple of weeks left with nothing to do. I'm thinking about picking up a new programming language. I'm good with Java (two summer internships that were exclusively java) and learned C about 3 years ago, though I don't really remember much about it.

Some personal background: I'm a senior in college studying electrical engineering, though I decided I like software more so I am taking Software Systems as my depth sequence. (Basically those classes are on: data structures, algorithms, basic OS stuff, and some (little) embedded design). Like I said, both of my last two summer internships were in Java, and the first one is actually where I picked up the language for the first time. I'm definitely interested in robotics though I'm not sure if I'll end up there yet after I graduate. 

So, any suggestions for a new language?"
yr3wn,6,2012-08-24,"Not sure what to do for my next move, career wise. ",Options745,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/yr3wn/not_sure_what_to_do_for_my_next_move_career_wise/,"I'll try to keep this as short as possible. Also made a throw-away for this, just in case.  

I have a 4 year bachelors degree, a BSBA in Information Systems Management. I had a 3.1 GPA in college, not a lot of extra curriculars but some. I currently have a job working in an IT Department as a help desk/Support technician, which came out of a paid internship I started in my sophomore year of college.  I have been working here full time for 2 years, and before that interning for about 4. It has been the only real place that I have worked, never had any ""real"" paying jobs before this or in place of this.

I am underpaid, or at least on the low end of what is ""expected"" for people in my major to make. I can verify this too because I've spoken with other people that I've graduated with who revealed their earnings.  So here are some more details:

* The company I work for is currently run by my uncles, so it is a family business of sorts. Coming out of school ( I graduated a semester later than everyone, in the fall of 09) most of my peers and friends in my major were having trouble finding jobs, and they had better grades and beefier resumes. I got scared, and didn't even bother interviewing for anyone else or looking for other jobs out of school.

* I always enjoyed working with the *people* I work with, so the fact that I wasn't necessarily doing exactly what I wanted (never wanted to work IT Support/help desk) was negated by the fact that a lot of the time work was enjoyable cause of the people I was around

* There was always the hope that being in the family would lead to easy promotions/some kind of managerial position in the near future

It has been 2 years, but it gets harder everyday to do the work that I have to do. Not in the sense of difficulty, but in the sense of motivation.  The only thing still keeping here is when I first started, my uncle proposed to me that, at anytime, he would pay full-ride for me to go to grad school to get a Masters in business administration or in accounting/finance. 

So here is what I have been tossing around in my head since last summer, still undecided what to do now:

I really don't want to work here anymore, at least not doing what I am doing. But there are no other options for me (here anyways) unless I go back to school. Thing is, I can't imagine how miserable I would be working 8 hours in a job I don't like, and then going straight to classes after that for night school for grad school, for the next 2 years. 

The other part of me thinks, if I tough it out those 2 years, I'll definitely get a different/better position here, paid more, and even if it doesn't work out, I'll have grad school on my resume for when I go elsewhere. I worry it would be a huge mistake to give up a free ride to grad school.

But, I could also forget the whole school deal, and just find a new job now, make about 20,000 or 30,000 more (approximately, again on average that is what people in my major are supposed to be making) and actually get to do something that is more tailored to my major, like being a business or systems analyst. Also making the amount of money people in my major are supposed to make would be totally fine for me, I never really aspired or wanted to make more than that, although obviously it would be nice if it turned out that way. But it is hard enough to get a job in this economy, although things have been picking up or so I hear. A lot of people don't have jobs, or are working underemployed.

I really am unsure what to do. Like I said I've been thinking about this almost daily for a year now. This might be depressing, but there really isn't a ""dream job"" that I ever had in mind. I guess my dream job would be to earn tips by playing my guitar and singing in coffee shops all day, but I know I can't have the lifestyle I want from doing that. 

I don't know, I guess I just want to see what other people's opinions are. I'm not looking to be told what to do, I just want to see it from other people's perspectives.

thanks for reading all this.

yr2pe,1,2012-08-24,Feeling Quite A Bit Of Anxiety That Is Not Getting Any Better.,[deleted],Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/yr2pe/feeling_quite_a_bit_of_anxiety_that_is_not/,"I am not really sure what is going on with me. I know that I have some anxiety issues, but they are starting to really take control at this point. To begin with, I am a young guy that just graduated. I have always had a very large issue with talking to girls (who doesn’t?) and have just written it off as something with which I struggle.

After graduating in May, I moved to Europe (from the US) and started an internship. The first 2 and a half months were quite great, I must admit. I was feeling good about how I was handling the lifestyle change, and was feeling comfortable with having some of my daily interactions in a different language. But then, I had a little bit of a dispute with my two flatmates, which led to (what I felt was) a huge amount of tension in the apartment. 

From there, it went downhill quickly for me. I would start to feel sick before heading back to my apartment, because I feared seeing my flatmates. After moving to a new apartment, I feel more comfortable with the new situation. But just this whole last week, I have had a huge feeling that something is terribly wrong. I am questioning every decision which brought me here. Did I do the right thing? Can I really be happy here? Will I even be able to go back to the US? 

Other things that have started to pick up are that I now am very aware of time. I am even more concerned that I will be late to places. It has become a norm for me to be about 20 minutes early to things. I don’t really feel hunger anymore, and will sometimes skip meals. Othertimes, I will force myself to eat, and then just keep eating for no reason. Almost without fail, I feel somewhat nauseas after eating. 

The worst part is that I feel a lump in my throat any time that I think about this. I cannot figure out what suddenly went so wrong. I have a great new job, with really nice people. I am a young person in a fantastic city. My apartment couldn’t be better and I am close with my new apartment mates (I was friends with them before moving in). But I just can’t get rid of the feeling like I want to jump on the next plane home.

Every time that I write this out to post on here, I just end up deleting it because I am so afraid that everyone will tell me that I am just overreacting to the sudden change of no longer being in school. But this time I am determined to actually post it.

yqo3w,1,2012-08-24,Friendly advice to social work majors.....,formersocialworker,utarlington,https://www.reddit.com/r/utarlington/comments/yqo3w/friendly_advice_to_social_work_majors/,"I should be attending grad school for social work starting tomorrow, but unfortunately i was kicked out of the program three months before graduation for my bachelors degree this year. I had completed all of my classes including the practicum &amp; internship (that i had to pay for.. makes sense right?) and three months before graduation, i was called into the field office and told to give all my stuff from my internship back and they would be contacting me at a later date to let me know what else to do. 


Now, you may be wondering, what in the fuck did i do, to fuck up so bad? Well, i made a few friends in my internship and i added a girl on facebook, because we were the same age &amp; were at the internship together alot. We were good friends last fall, then christmas break happened and we became distant, and then we talked a little again in the past spring semester. I had quit my job so i could devote all of my time to the internship &amp; took on a lot of tasks. I was working really hard i had about 5 groups i was facilitating and visiting schools to do so, as well as attending the afterschool programs. One of the groups i was facilitating had a mixed age group like 6-12 year olds. One of the girls had a severe disability that i didn't understand how to deal with. So i asked my supervisor at the internship what to do, and that i was uncomfortable with the entire group. She basically told me to buck up and deal with it, and offered absolutely no advice on how to be comfortable. I asked other interns, they had no advice. I asked the staff, they were no help at all. So after exhausting all measures, i finally ended up posting on facebook, asking what to do if you were in a situation. I suppose i ended up calling out the student, and ""identifying"" her, therefore exposing her confidentiality, but we weren't doing anything confidential. The internship i was in, was kind of like being at a daycare, and not really related to social work at all. 


Fast forward a month, I come down with a virus, and call into the internship and my director says it's fine, just meet me tomorrow at UTA in the field office. I'm thinking, wtf is going on? No clue. I ask everyone i know, did something happen while i was gone? No one knows. So i show up, i'm a little anxious and my director comes in, ignores me and walks straight past me to the back office. Immediately i'm called into my field advisors office and i'm told i'm being kicked out of my internship. I had to pry and ask why, and they said ""because of facebook"". So i left, returned my internship stuff back to the office and started trying to find a new internship. Well F me cause they meant i'm being kicked out of the entire social work PROGRAM. During the student success meeting, the head of the field office came and told the people who were serving me my sentence (basically) that i had told others that if i found the person who had ratted me out i would KILL HER, so she came to the office wanting protection from me. I never said such a thing, she made it up, trying to slander me. 

Here's my helpful advice: FYI there's a thing called a ""professional review board committee"" in social work, and you won't know about it until you're called in front of it. There's also a code of conduct handbook that you won't receive EVER, unless you ask for it, that details how you should behave, dress &amp; act while attending the social work program. When you're called in front of the review board, you're only allowed to have a classmate with you. No lawyers, no family members, only a classmate, and you must notify them. During this meeting they call in some people you've never seen or heard of before, your field advisor, and the head of the student success department (which isn't actually there for your success.. just so you know...) and they'll tell you how you fucked up and won't listen to a word you say. Now, my circumstances may be different than yours. You may get called in because you said something unethical in class, or you have poor marks, or you've missed too much of class and are in danger of failing the program who knows. But please, for the love of god. Watch who you become friends with, and watch what you say on facebook. And read the code of ethics &amp; values word for word like you're a devout christian reading all versions of the bible because your teachers will NOT teach you about it. 


**TLDR : Don't become friends with people on facebook unless you're sure they're not an asshole. Read your code of ethics thoroughly, ask for the student code of conduct, don't talk shit about the program even if you're mad. Office of student success isn't there for your success and will most likely try to slander you. Also, you cannot declare a minor with social work. So i literally wasted four years of my life in the worst classes i've ever taken. Get out while you still can, and do something else. You won't regret it.**


PS. All other degrees at UTA are awesome. UTA is a pretty good school, and you'll have a great time. But the social work department needs help/work. "
ytm69,3,2012-08-25,My long-distance relationship of 5-years ended in May. Still devastated.,longdistsucks,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/ytm69/my_longdistance_relationship_of_5years_ended_in/,"Throwaway. I'm a [M,24] and was in a 5-year old relationship until early May with a [F,24] . Amazing girl. Most of these 5 years were spent long-distance - the first 4 we were in the same country but in the last year I had to go abroad for my graduate studies.

I had warned her that between time-difference issues and my studies, our communication would be less than ideal. Still, I tried my best - called her every single day for almost an hour. 

In early May, just a week before my birthday, she said it wasn't working out for her because she didn't feel anything for me any more. I find it hard to believe because we were just a year away from me proposing (she knew I was going to propose in a year's time) and we were so close together that we'd planned our kids names and everything.

Anyway, I was devastated, but got an internship immediately after she dumped me, so I kept myself occupied. Though I often broke down and begged her to take me back, which she refused.

I feel hard done by because she was the more selfish one in the relationship, and I had sacrificed far more than my share of things to keep things working. Some days of these 5 years, as a poor student, I had the choice between eating and saving money for calling her - and I did the latter. I defied my parents and lied to them several times just for her. Basically I sacrificed the shit out of anything I could give so we could keep the long-distance going.

The thing about her is she's too stubborn - often even to the point when she doesn't accept stuff even when she's wrong and some else is right. I'm still sure that she's made a huge mistake, and we're right for each other (though I know I'm not the first one to claim this). I'm just having a really hard time getting through life. I'm not suicidal but I've lost the will to live. Case in point - I was almost run over by a car while crossing the road, but I didn't feel anything - no fear. I was more like ""Meh, maybe I'm meant to die here on the road. What's left to live for anyway?""

Please help. I know I'm not going to get her back. But she was my best friend and the only one I confided in for so many things. I really don't know how to get my life back on track - something I need to do because my vacations have ended and am going back to school come next week.

Any sort of advice would do. I've tried the whole 'try forgetting her', 'dont track her on FB/Twitter' sort of thing but it doesn't seem to work. I find myself associating everything with her &amp; our past (even though it was long distance, we've lived in the same city for months, and I've visited her a bunch of times) - these memories keep flooding back and just form a huge bottomless pit in my stomach and heart. I don't know what to do :("

ytjw2,4,2012-08-25,Quarantined isolation is the best thing to happen to me in a long while...,TuberColossus,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ytjw2/quarantined_isolation_is_the_best_thing_to_happen/,"Ever since high school I have had depressive bouts that would last from weeks to months where I find myself overcome with self-loathing and a crippling awareness of myself complete with vivid suicidal ideations.

I've recently finished college in five long years a few months back and I was ready to start a new chapter of my life on a better footing. I had an internship that I was doing well in and I saw my friends quite regularly and made some new ones too. I was also just waiting for the next time I would be swallowed into the pit of darkness that is my mind because I have come to expect it when things are going remotely well for me.

Three months ago I went to the doctor after coughing up an inordinate amount of blood and was diagnosed with walking pneumonia. I was given some antibiotics and I felt better after the treatment. My coughing didn't stop but I ascribed that to my habitual smoking that I picked up in college, I had dropped tobacco months before I graduated. I went for a followup and was subsequently diagnosed with active tuberculosis. It had ravaged my lungs by that point and it was great that it hasn't spread throughout my body yet. I was immediately quarantined and put into isolation. I have been there since.

I didn't know what to expect except for the eventual bout of depression to come and take me over. For the first thirty or so days I did quite fine. Family visited often and so did my friends, old and new. One had sent me his guitar so I can learn and I'm actually doing pretty well on it now. It is a good alternative for my desire to scream at the top of my lungs. The isolation has given me the opportunity for intense self-reflection, insight, and meditation; some things that I had always practiced even before but this experience had only intensified them. I started to write again and I remembered how much I used to love it.

In this room I finally realized that I needed to see a professional regularly for my problems so I've sought out therapists with expertise in Existential Therapy; I have a few standing appointments when I get out. I am still filled with self-loathing but the dedication of my friends had shown me that they see something in me that I fail to realize myself. It's now my duty to seek that out. I told one of my closest friend (who also suffers and is medicated for depression) that I didn't deserve them in my life and he immediately stopped me, saying that I was dead wrong and that people loved and cared about me and I owe it to them to at least try to understand why that is. He said I was crazy as to how I can think that, and I told him I might be considering I was depressed and we both laughed morbidly.

I have also realized fully that the world goes on with or without you, and now I'm filled with a motivation to make the best of my time and I have this surge of will to live fully once I get out. The monkey on my back isn't gone but now I can face this brave new world with my chin up. 

The last week has been hard on me. The depressive properties of the medication they're giving me has started to manifest themselves and the suicidal thoughts are back in full force. I'm struggling to stay in good spirits but the uncertain time of my release only exacerbates the darkness. I don't know why I wrote this but I just felt like I needed to tell someone how I've been feeling.

**TL;DR Depressive gets put into isolation. Still a depressive but now with an intense desire to live fully.**"
ytg76,3,2012-08-25,ok... Help reddit... Need relationship advice/opinions from girls and guys. I'm suspicious of my girlfriend and her new friend. Am I insane? Is it founded? She won't answer me so i'm turning to you. ,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ytg76/ok_help_reddit_need_relationship_adviceopinions/,"My girlfriend is rich and i'm not. Her mom would threaten to cut her off if she knew we were dating. My gf is totally dependent as in rent, car and med school education. (she began at u toledo last monday.) This has kept me out of huge chunks of her life and has made us completely stop out relationship at times. I love her so I try to make the best of it, but I complain when it's especially awful. We have been dating for nine months and her parents don't know I exist.this makes me feel that she sees me as unworthy. She lies to them constantly to keep them from being upset.


She has been dishonest to me several times in the past and most often involving her social interacting with men. She once went on vacation to st thomas and ended up being accosted by some dude at his beach house at five am even though she didn't really want to be there. Despite that fact of her not wanting to be there, she still danced all morning and went skinny dipping in the ocean - she claims she had on a tshirt and underwear.

About a two months ago, we went through a particularly rocky patch. as a result or if it was going on beforehand, she started up a flirtatious relationship with some intern at work. She would come to my house and we'd have sex and then she would go home and text him goodnight. I found out, she said it was over, but the next weekend, she went out with him again and then made out in the car. The whole time she,was telling me not to worry and that nothing like that was going on. I made her call him in front of me just to make sure it was over, but she wouldn't state me as the reason. She complimented me on how understanding I was being. Now I think she's taking that for granted and my kindness for weakness.

Tl;dr? Here's what's fucking me up right now. Tell me what you think. Should I be suspicious? Do you think i'm wrong?

1. She just got back from a three week vacation with her mom. It was a lot if sneaking phone calls and getting hung up on suddenly. She did talk to me much more than she usually does in such situations.

2. Monday was her first day of med school. She was all concerned about her outfit. I helped pick one out over skype. She wanted to look like she was taking it very seriously and professional. Some dude sat next to her in the class. On break, he asked for her number and she gave it. After class, he invited her to go with him to do some admin errands and to the library to study. She went. She says she told him then that she had a bf.

3. Tuesday, she said he sat on the other side of the room as her. I thought probably because he found out she was taken. She wore jeans and a long sleeve button up.

3. Wednesday, she wore jeans and a t shirt. She said her phone was fucking up and she couldn't message me. After class, she went to a study session and this guy was there. She didn't call me afterwards like she said she would. They walked to their cars together and she told him she liked his watch.

4. Thursday, she wore an extremely tight short skirt and a tight white shirt that unzips all the way down the from and heels to class. We talked later and she went on and on making fun of girls in her class wearing short shorts and sandals and how it was so hard to take them seriously and that they were desperate for male attention.

5. Friday.... She went to class in short shorts and sandals. Just like the girls she talked shit on. I called her out on the hypocrisy. Later that night, friday night, the guy texted get asking her to hang out.

I think my girl is missing obvious signals from guys.I know it's not right, but she acts like she doesn't know that if she's drunk on vacation at a guys beach house at five am going into the ocean with nothing on, that guys will try to hook up. I ask her to be more cautious considering the history but she refuses. I'm worried that she hates these girls but sees how people they are and sees how they're ogled and then tried to be like them. She's acted like someone else for approval in the past. She does things she says she didn't really want to do with guys A LOT. deep down, is it all about attention from men? Can I convince her to be most concerned about my attention? She's 22 &amp; around all sorts of college dudes. I'm 33. This guy supposedly has a girlfriend but she's in cali. Should I be suspicious? Does it seem like he's interested? Should I trust her blindly? Please indicate m/f in comments."
ytc6c,2,2012-08-25,"I [29M] broke up with my ex [28F] over 2 months ago, and am now regretting not trying to work on things instead. Does her continued contact mean she wants another try?",logiccannon,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ytc6c/i_29m_broke_up_with_my_ex_28f_over_2_months_ago/,"I [29M] was dating a fantastic woman [28F] for 3 years, from July 2009 to the middle of June this year. The first 2 years of the relationship were amazing, but during the last year or so she was fighting a deep depression over her career which ultimately drove a wedge between us, causing me to end the relationship on June 13. I really didn't want to end things but felt like I had no other option at the time and I was so incredibly frustrated with her due to some things that happened recently. I felt really bad about the timing of it, because the very next morning, June 14, I had to leave to work 1100 miles away for the next 9 weeks. She left my apartment in tears, telling me that she had always loved me even if it hadn't appeared that way (because of her withdrawal due to depression). She also asked if we could still talk, to which I said yes if she really wanted to.

Over the next 4 weeks, she contacted me almost daily, and was always the first one to send texts. She would wish me a good day, joke about the weather, and tell me that she was so happy for me that I was doing what I loved (I was interning at a new job, new career). She even texted me one day to tell me that she got her hair cut, just little mundane things. Lots of smileys, very positive messages. She asked me to call her one night when she was on a long drive, and I talked to her for almost an hour, and our conversation was great, it felt like old times. Her texts started to die off a bit not long after and I didn't hear from her at all for about 3 weeks. Then she texted me again and we had an hour-long conversation about life, with her volunteering that she had been visiting her sister in NY and a friend in Chicago the last few weeks and had been very busy. By this point my 9 weeks out of town was almost up, and she started asking when I was coming back. Then, after I was back in town, she texted me to ask if I had made it back safely, and then again a couple of days ago to wish me a great first day of classes (finishing my degree this semester).

She has also commented positively on some Facebook posts of mine over the summer, and has not taken down any of the many pictures of us on her Facebook page, even the romantic ones.

Now, she has been on my mind since I left for my internship. I thought about her every day, and still do. We were together for 3 years, and we were the type of couple that sees each other almost every day, so she was a very large part of my life, and I hers. We shared almost exactly the same core values regarding life and had common goals, and we never actually fought much or had any traumatic experiences. 

I have been regretting that I ended things rather than attempting to work at them, and have been thinking about the possibility of reconciling with her, but only if she has worked on her issues and / or is willing to go to couples counseling together. Even though it would be a lot of work and there would be no guarantee that it wouldn't just end in more hurt, I feel like we have been through so much together and care so strongly for one another that if we didn't at least give it one last try that I personally would regret it for a long time, wondering ""what if?"" 

The topper for me is that during our relationship we have both been working so hard on goals that distracted us from one another, like my schooling and her working extra hours to pay off loans. Well, now her loans are paid off and I am graduating in just a few months, so all the external distractions and barriers are evaporating. I feel like we would be in a great situation to try anew.

My question is: What does all this contact from her mean? Is she trying to keep the door open? Waiting for me to make a move? Just trying to remain friends? Would love some female opinions on this.

At this point I'm leaning toward asking her out for a drink or coffee soon. Would it be best to keep the first meeting casual to feel things our, or jump right into talk of trying again?

**TL;DR: Broke up with my GF of 3 years and am now regretting it and want to give it another try, is her steady communication with me a sign that she does too?**"
ytbap,1,2012-08-25,Halp reddit... Need relationship advice/opinions from girls and guys. I'm suspicious of my girlfriend and her new friend. Am I insane? Is it founded? She won't answer me so i'm turning to you. ,[deleted],dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/ytbap/halp_reddit_need_relationship_adviceopinions_from/,"So... Here is the story. I've been dating a girl for about nine months. She comes from a rich family while mine is pretty dirt poor. This is a major issue. She comes from a jewish family &amp; her mother is very controlling. I was raised catholic - the religious stuff doesn't matter much - &amp; never met my real dad. The relationship she had previous to me was with a guy with pretty much the same background as I and when her mother found out about it, she flipped the fuck out. The mother has, on several occasions including this one, threatened to cut off her own daughter from money &amp; the family if my girlfriend doesn't do as she's told or as is expected. She is completely dependent on them for everything. They pay her rent her bills for food cars credit cards clothes school etc and she is fearful of upsetting her mother and having those things taken away. Obviously, she broke up with her previous boyfriend and her mom had successfully ""killed a mosquito with a bazooka."" 

As a result, my girlfriends parents have absolutely no idea that I exist. As I say, we've been dating for nine months now. This has of course put tremendous strain on our relationship, at least for me. She says that she's used to it so it doesn't bother her as much. She goes on frequent family vacations and it is nearly impossible for us to communicate like a normal couple because she has to hide everything. There are major events in her life that I can't partake in because her parents will be there. She just got into med school and I was supportive the entire time however I could not attend her first days ceremony even though we talk about being together forever. All because her parents would disapprove of me. I won't even get into what that does for my self esteem: knowing that my girlfriend doesn't think i'm good enough to throw caution to the wind and tell her parents about and knowing for sure her mother wouldn't think I was good enough. A huge problem is that in most of her other life, she is a come what may, let the chips fall where they will kind of person and very sort of free with herself but not so with this. It really feels like, if she can't tell her parents about me, she doesn't approve of me on some level either. Like, even though I don't have much, my love for her isn't enough to gain enough approval from her.

we've had ups and downs like any relationship. I've got glaring issues of my own, but ones that i'm completely open with her about. I'm a pretty jealous guy. I was in the military for quite a while so i'm sort if ocd about things and I could really improve my temper. I'm seeing a shrink on a regular basis. I'm not very trusting as I have been severely burnt in the past and I try to be very upfront and clear about it to... Sort of ask for my partners help keeping it on check. The problem is that she has lied to me various times about things both big and small. Once, she lied to me about going to some appointment even though I didn't give a shit at all. Another time, she lied to me for months about some situation involving a group of guys she admitted to flirting with in st thomas. It ended with some guy trying to make out with her at the end of the night in his beach house after they all went skinny dipping. (she claims she wore a tshirt while everyone else was naked.) She claims it's all because I make it difficult for her to tell be things. I'm willing to admit that that is true and that i'm partly to blame however, I won't take all of it.
A few months ago, things were especially rocky for us. For about a month, she was in a flirtatious relationship with an intern at the place where she worked but claims that she was completely innocent the entire time. We got into a huge blow out and the next day she went into work and gave her number to this other guy. They went out for drinks one night. that same day, she was at my house talking about working things out and then later was on a date with him. We stayed together but a few days later I found out that she was still texting him acting obviously interested. She claimed that she was just using him and keeping him around in case things between us went south. But she also said that she was completely uninterested in him and never going to see him again. We broke up again on a wednesday. She showed up at my house unannounced on saturday and again we decided to work things out. Later that night she went to a movie with the guy and made out with him. We were back together again on monday. The whole time I was stressed out and worried about what,all this,meant for our relationship and she went on and on about how everything was just fine and that I had absolutely nothing to worry about. She told me to look into my heart and just belie her that nothing was going on and I did, but the whole time it really was. She made my own heart into a liar. But I gave her another chance. She was surprised how understanding I was about the whole thing. My jealous ridiculous self made her call him right in front of me and to tell him it,was over. I just wanted to be sure and it was impossible to trust that she would really let me know if it was or not. However, she wouldn't tell him that urges because she loved me. It was almost as if she was ashamed to admit that to him.
Currently, it is her first week of med school. Like I said, I couldn't go to her ceremony. After the ceremony, she went on a three week vacation with her mom and we had to sneak phone calls and I had to endure being hung yo on when her mom came in the room.... Ill break down the rest sort of short hand. Just the facts.
On monday, in her first day of class, this guy sat down next to her. When a break came up, he asked for her number to hang out sometime and she gave it to him. Class ended. She went with this guy to do various school admin errands then claims she had lunch by herself. Then, she met this guy at the library and they studied together for a while. She says she told him about me by saying, I have to call my boyfriend. Another note on monday, she was very concerned about what she was going to wear. She says that she wanted to look like she was professional and taking school seriously... I helped her pick out an outfit over skype. This becomes important later.
On tuesday, after she had told this guy she had a boyfriend, she says he sat across the room from her. I took it as he was no longer showing interest. It sounded like her feelings were hurt. She also dressed in jeans and a collared shirt that day. 
On wednesday, she claimed that her phone wouldn't work most of the day and I barely heard from her until ten o'clock at night. She wore jeans and a tshirt. She also says she was having lunch with some girls that she met. They were planning a party for friday. After class ended, she went to the library for a guided study session. There were six people there and this guy was one of them. Afterwards they walked to their cars together and as far as I know, their conversation consisted of her telling him how much she liked his watch.
On thursday, she wore the shortest, tightest skirt she could get away with without being totally trashy and a shirt that completely unzippered in the front. She looked good in it, it was just obviously a sex appeal outfit and not something a person would normally wear to class. As I say, she was wearing jeans and t shirts basically the other days and now she was dressed for a date just for school. I complained about it. I just wanted people to take her seriously and for her to be consistent &amp; to not try so hard working on an outfit to go sit at a desk learning for eight hours. I just thought it was silly&amp;  obviously meant for other purposes. I didn't want her or anyone else distracted because of her. She agreed that she didn't want to be a distraction. She said she didn't want to be the kind of girl to impress with her looks at school and would rather impress other ways. She talked shit on girls like that. FINISHED IN COMMENTs Almost done

yt2tv,6,2012-08-25,Not sure about my LTR at the moment...long post.,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yt2tv/not_sure_about_my_ltr_at_the_momentlong_post/,"I (F/24) have been with my significant other (M/27) for over five years. I live at home with my parents and he lives at home with his mom.

When we first began dating, I wanted to be with him all the time. However, he was much more introverted than me and obviously still feeling out the relationship, so he rarely called and didn't want to spend much time with me. Resentment built up for a while before I finally told him, via email, that I was upset that he rarely took the initiative to call me or invite me over, it was almost always me calling and saying we should spend time together, and often when I said I wanted to see him, he told me he didn't feel like being social. My boyfriend was understanding and afterwards, he began initiating contact more often. 

As time has passed and we've grown comfortable with each other and in our relationship, I'm no longer clingy and my boyfriend initiates contact quite often (though I don't get upset when he doesn't, like I used to). However, I've noticed that *I'm* now the one who rarely initiates contact and would rather stay home and read than see him some days. I feel less attracted to him, for reasons which I'll describe in a moment. He doesn't seem to notice, or if he does, he doesn't mind. I guess that's the good thing about having an introverted boyfriend, but at the same time I wish he'd ask me if there's something wrong because, and here's a big part of my problem, I'm terrible at communication.

Growing up, my parents discouraged any show of negative emotion. I was not allowed to be upset or angry. If I was mad at my parents, they got angry at me and yelled at me. If I was in a bad mood, they yelled at me. Even now, any time I try to tell my mother that she's being nosy or rude or doing something to upset me, she yells at me and tells me to go away and won't talk to me. Then, the next day, she'll pretend that everything is okay. I have *never* been apologized to by my parents. Because of this, I'm afraid to tell anyone about anything they may have done to upset me. I'm afraid to communicate my feelings of anger to the person who has made me angry. And this is, I fear, a big reason why I'm not too happy with my relationship.

I have a lot of issues besides the aforementioned issues with communication; I have a severe phobia, I have anxiety, I have panic attacks and I have depression. These issues cause a lot of physical symptoms, like back and neck pain, IBS and nausea, headaches, lightheadedness and fatigue. My boyfriend has been so understanding and loving, which is yet another reason why I don't want to discuss his issues. How can I call him out on his problems when I have my own?

But the thing is, I'm trying to help myself. I've read a lot of books on phobias, anxiety and depression and am always trying to incorporate their advice. I've seen a counselor in the past and I began seeing a new one recently. I'm trying to keep a regular sleep schedule and get in some exercise to boost my endorphins. I also try to do yoga or meditate. Unfortunately, the anxiety has made me very antisocial, so I prefer not to go out when I'm with my boyfriend. I feel bad for not wanting to see movies or go out to dinner, but he has never seemed to mind; he also has friends in the area with whom he sees movies with and spends time with twice a week, so at least I'm not keeping him from being social entirely.

But here's where my problems with him begin. He'll be 28 soon, but despite being in school for almost 10 years, he only has an associate's degree. He has been trying to get a bachelor's degree for years, but he continuously fails his classes. He has been suspended from college twice. He frequently skips classes for stupid reasons, like not being able to find a parking spot (there are *always* spots on campus, sometimes just very far away or in a paid parking garage) or to do homework for another class (which he wouldn't even do, and because he missed another class, he'd fall behind in that class, too). He would turn in papers and homework late because the professors ""only take off 10 points per day."" We both think that he has ADD and possibly depression, which is causing some of his troubles with school. While he was growing up, his mother did not motivate him to do his schoolwork, so even from a young age he had trouble with getting homework done. While I'm frustrated that he's still in college (I graduated over two years ago, cum laude, despite all of my issues), what bothers me most is his total lack of motivation to do anything about it. Obviously, what he's been doing does not work, yet he won't change anything. Even when he only takes one or two classes, he still fails. He works less than 20 hours a week, so he's not too busy. I've suggested that he see a counselor or seek out academic help on campus, but he just gave a half-hearted ""maybe"" and changed the subject. At this rate, he'll either be kicked out of college completely or manage to graduate with terrible grades. He also won't take my other suggestion of dropping out and trying to find an internship or working at his current job full time for a while. I'm afraid to say much more on this subject to him, despite how much it frustrates me, because I don't want to make it seem like I'm less accepting if his issues than he is of mine. I can't say, ""I finished college in five years, even though I had a complete breakdown and dealt with severe anxiety and depression the entire time,"" because everyone is different and we deal with our problems in different ways. I just wish he'd do *something* besides the same old things that have never worked.

On top of this, I've started feeling annoyed with his hobbies, or rather, lack thereof. All he does is watch TV/movies, play around on the internet, play video/computer games and roleplay. The roleplaying thing, while I don't understand the appeal at all, doesn't bother me in and of itself - I'm glad he has a social activity that he really enjoys. But I've started finding him a bit...boring. Again, I feel like a hypocrite for saying this because I still have panic attacks when I go out, so I don't go out very much. Even so, I spend time writing or drawing, I go for nature walks, I exercise, I practice new languages. I may be a homebody, but I don't think I'm *too* boring. But I feel like I can't share these things with my boyfriend. I try to get him to go on walks with me, but he often says he's too tired. If I manage to get him outside, he'll complain the entire time that's it's too bright, too hot, there's too many bugs, etc. I love nature, despite its annoyances, so I get a bit miffed when he shows so much disdain for it. Even though he admits that he needs to exercise and spend more time outside (vitamin D, fresh air and all that) he still won't do it. Same with exercising in general - says he should, but hardly ever does it because he ""hates being sweaty."" He hates being sweaty so much that he will mow less than half of his yard, stop and take a shower and wait until the next day to mow the rest. He does this with all yard work. I find it incredibly ridiculous and it makes me wonder, if we live together will I be the one doing *all* the work because he can't handle a little sweat?

I think we share this issue with communication. He has told me, multiple times, that he ""never gets mad"" at me. Either he's lying, or he truly feels this way, and both of those options worry me. He's actually told me in the past that he doesn't feel emotions strongly. The fact that he doesn't get upset with me makes me feel guilty when I'm upset with him. This builds resentment, which we all know is terrible for relationships. I think he's just as bad at communication as I am.

Our sex life has also always been lacking. I had a much higher sex drive than him. This used to bother me a lot. For the last six months or so, my sex drive has decreased significantly. I know part of the reason for this is increased stress and fatigue, but another large part is I just don't feel attracted to him as much. With his failing classes consistently, never trying to help himself in any way and generally being lazy, I don't have much interest in having sex.

I don't know how to talk to him about all of this without making it seem like I don't love him, without making it seem like I'm a victim or without hurting his feelings. I know I'm so far from perfect and that these issues could be so much worse (he is very loving and supportive and has *never* abused me in any way) but I'm not very happy with my relationship at the moment. Even though we've been together so long, and despite me saying, ""I only want to get married if it's to you,"" I have absolutely no idea if he wants to marry me. He said he wants to live with me, but that doesn't mean he'll want to marry me someday. Again, with my fear of communication, I've refrained from outright asking, ""will we get married someday?"" The thing is, I don't know if I want to marry him anymore. I don't know if I even want to live with him anymore. People can change, but only if they want to and work at it. I can't make him change his bad habits and it seems as if he has no interest in doing so. How can I talk to him about all of this without damaging our relationship further? Is there anything I can do to get him to see that he's in danger of losing me without it being a threat or an ultimatum? I don't believe that there is anyone else in this world who could be so loving and supportive of me, who doesn't think I'm a freak or insane for the way I act when I'm depressed or panicking, whom I love so much. If I can't have him, then I want to be alone. I'm beginning to feel like being alone would be better and I don't know if it's primarily the depression talking, or if I really am not meant for this man.

TL;DR My boyfriend has no motivation, I'm afraid of communication and I need advice."

Week one weight loss: 5 lbs

After the first week, things are starting to looking up, but it definitely could have been stronger.  My diet has definitely improved. I have been able to avoid fried foods, and only had one dessert item (a small slice from a pie I made to thank people at my office as my internship ended).  I have also begun my first allergy test by cutting out all dairy from my diet.  In this coming week I hope to really focus on my portion control.

In terms of exercise I had a pretty mixed result week.  I was able to get in just about as much cardio workouts as I would have liked; two days of fencing practice, a close to 5 mile walk on a trip out for dinner, and I did my first run of about 8 years.  The issue is that I didn't get in any days of pure muscle training.

For this coming week, I will be starting classes up again for my first semester as a senior.  I hope that the 15 min bike/40 min walk to class will help to keep me on track.  The benefit of already being on campus should also help with getting myself to the gym there.

Overall, I think that week 2 should be stronger week than the last, as I suspect much of my weight gain resulted from my desk/driving job."
yss94,6,2012-08-25,"Boyfriend's work ethic seems to be draining the romance from our relationship. Am I being too selfish?
",sunglasses789,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/yss94/boyfriends_work_ethic_seems_to_be_draining_the/,"I've [F 23] been dating this Japanese guy[M 28] for almost 4 years. We lived together for a year, had sex all the time. Then we each did a year of study abroad (so one year of LD). And then moved in together again. The long distance was really hard for me, and at times I felt near my breaking point. I was in a foreign country meeting awesome people, and it was incredibly frustrating that my boyfriend didn’t really seem to care for webcam sex or how often a week we communicated. (we did do both of those things, but not nearly enough in my opinion; he was too busy studying). 

After moving in together the second time, our relationship was still great (although the sex was FAR less frequent than the first year), and I even brought up the topic of marriage with him a few times. He would never contribute much to these conversations except, “I can’t even think about marriage until I get a stable job.” And I can respect that, and thought that I could wait. But getting a good job in the States is hard for any foreigner, as the Visa fees are insanely high. So my boyfriend works his ass off in school, and is always too tired for sex (at least he aces all his classes right…?) On top of the poor sex life, he doesn’t have money to do fun things outside of school, so we don’t have much a social life. 

And now fast-forward to right now. I’m working in my hometown, and he’s off to graduate school. The distance is only about a 4 hour trip to visit by car, so it’s not terrible. But I have a feeling that he’ll never have the time or money to come see me, because graduate school is obviously much more difficult than undergrad. I’ve gone to see him a time or two already, but completely at my own expense, which hurts my pocketbook too. And I’m just gonna throw this in, he needed to buy a cheap bed he could easily move since he had an internship to go to and a new apartment to move into. So he bought an air mattress. And he won’t have sex on it because it could pop. He has no other *fucking* furniture so to speak, so I’m forced to kneel on a cold tile floor, which hurts my shins/back and kills the mood. 

We’ve been long distance (for the second time) about 3 months now, and am really starting to feel a dip in the romance again. We get on skype, we chat/talk about our day, and I hear how hard school is for him. It’s getting horribly bland but I always try to smile and support him in his studies the best I can.
I have a sweet, hardworking, responsible boyfriend. I trust him completely, and he emotionally supports me when I’m down. But I feel like because he has to work so hard to provide for himself and his studies, our relationship isn’t equal enough, and that while he works on himself, I have to work harder to keep the relationship an actual relationship. When we lived together I even did a little extra work around the house like cleaning and cooking, hoping he would be a little friskier and want to have fun. But it didn’t help.

I just have to wonder if I’m just focusing on these things too much now that he’s not physically here, and I feel incredibly lonely. Or, maybe I am finally seeing him and our relationship for what it really is now that the physical/sexual part(what little we had) of the relationship is out of the equation. It sickens me, but I’ve been fantasizing about other men lately, and hate myself for it. I felt like I’ve been very patient with this relationship all these years, and have been very accepting of the fact that he doesn’t really have time or money for me. But now I’m feeling that I don’t know how much longer I can wait for the tides to finally turn. I’m still young, and I feel like I have to invest a few more years into this relationship to be able to see marriage as an option again (until he gets a job), which scares me a little. Reddit, do you think I’m being too selfish?

**TLDR;** **Foreign boyfriend is hardworking but financially troubled and doesn't really seem to have time for a relationship, but we are still trying to make it work. It feels like a few more years would be needed until he's in a situation where he can marry, and that thought is starting to scare me. I feel like I'm young and should be out having adventures, or at least having fun with someone. Am I being to selfish?**"

My mom got diagnosed w/ Stage IV ovarian cancer at the beginning of the summer.   I've tried to visit when I come into town, which was not much this summer due to an internship in another area. 

 The cancer was spread so much that they couldn't do surgery initially, so they started her on chemo in hopes that they could come in later to do surgery.  ""Later"" is this tuesday.  Between the initial diagnosis and today, she has been admitted into the hospital about 5-6 times, not counting the times she has gone to the ER.  She just got admitted again from being sick.  They say if she isn't better by Tuesday, they may not do the surgery.  My questions are what should I expect as time goes on? Does the inevitable just pop up at random or is it slow, creeping, and painful?

yv8r4,1,2012-08-26,"Broke up with GF last April, spent May-Aug out of state, come back and started talking...Am I an idiot?",[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/yv8r4/broke_up_with_gf_last_april_spent_mayaug_out_of/,"Male here (24) her also (24).  I ended a 3 year relationship with her last April because of deflating feelings. The first year of our relationship we spent at home together and things were overall great.  She then moved down to university and the next 2 years were spent at distance.  

We were both loyal during this time and I visited roughly every other weekend.  There were many fights while at distance but many were due to my alcohol binges when visiting her.  We have broken up roughly 7-8 times due to dumb, alcohol related fights but were always back together within 1-3 days.  

Last break up that has lasted this whole time (she was still away) was a day where she called (had been drinking) expressing deflating interest and I agreed and it was done.  When I said I agreed she cried for me back and said she didn't mean it but I stuck with it.

This past summer I attended an internship and was out of state but we had contact (texting, occasional talking).  She has since moved home from university and is now finishing up at the same university I attend.  Since I came home we have spent some time together, kissed/hugged (nothing more intimate), I showed her around school to help. 

She has been on dates when I was gone and I have had some random nights with girls.  Not positive on extent of her hook ups, no sex for me though.  My initial thought going through the break up was not that I was uninterested in her, but that I thought I could find a more attractive lady.  NOT saying she is unattractive.  I still find her very attractive, I think the distance was getting to me. 

Both of our parents are pretty annoyed of our back and forth nature as well as our friends.  We would pretty much be going against all advice from all parties if they knew we have been in such contact since I have been back home. 

Do I think that because we are back together at home without distance that this can work again?  Or do I No-Contact ASAP..."
yuzkk,39,2012-08-26,Age 27 - 43 days...and I feel awful,[deleted],NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/yuzkk/age_27_43_daysand_i_feel_awful/,"Hi guys, this is my umpteenth attempt at recovering from porn addiction, but now I'm in my longest kick of 43 days--no PMO of any kind. 

**Background info:**

I'm 27, been fapping since I was 5, and haven't stopped since. Playboys and Skinamax as a kid, but I graduated to Internet porn at 13 or so (though it was only 56K, didn't get broadband 'til age 16). Didn't lose my v-card 'til 22, never been in a real relationship until this year. Single now. Sex life is inconsistent. I've only had PIV sex about ten times in my life. I've been fapping consistently to *heavy* Internet porn since 16. Once a day usually, but often 2-3 times. Lots of edging, yada yada. 

I've had *crippling* anxiety around women I've been attracted to, low sex drive, and my social life is the weakest area in my life. I can talk to and interact easily enough with unattractive (read: fat) women, and other ladies whom I don't give a shit about. But if she's actually hot, I become extremely anxious and self-conscious, and I feel like they pick up on it. If I could describe the feeling in one word, it'd be **powerless**. Like I'm a slave to my sexual impulses, and that women have all the control in the world over me because of it, especially since I've never had much of the real thing (and desperately want it). I'm currently in counseling to work on that, along with some other self-esteem issues. I train regularly in MMA and BJJ (getting my purple belt this year, w00t!), which helps with my anxiety and has given me a degree of confidence. I've lived an adventurous life, taken a TON of risks, and lived to tell the tale(s). But no matter what, I feel that crippling anxiety when it comes to my social skills and dating in general. It's weird...I can perform in front of an audience of hundreds, I can get into the cage and fight against grown-ass men no problem, but I still get nervous being around attractive women. So, here I am, 43 days in.

**The first 3 weeks:**

Shitty. Not so much physically horny, but mentally so. Like my brain was going, ""Fuck you *and* your mother for putting me through this!"" I began to feel a change in my brain; it felt like there was a throbbing sensation in my left hemisphere whenever I had any sexual thoughts. As time went by that feeling abated. I played a LOT of Seiken Densetsu 3 (old-school SNES RPG, check it out) and listened to the Joe Rogan podcast to get by (although he did talk about pornstars and the Fleshlight somewhat, so it did trigger some thoughts). Been writing quite a bit. My training did improve, but slightly. Personally, I think the Incredible Hulk feeling a lot of guys get when they stop fapping is overrated, but YMMV. I flirted with girls here and there, and a night with cuddling with the ex (no kissing or sex) certainly helped. A little more eye contact with people, but it's been more intense. Intense pornographic dreams (I really hate these). I edged ONCE around the two-week mark, but I overcame it with sheer willpower. That was the first time I successfully didn't cave into an edging, and it gave me a fuck-ton of confidence in knowing that I had the discipline to overcome my urges when they arose. Around end of the third week I felt more calm as I began to flatline. 

**The next 3 weeks:**

Better, at first. The next two weeks I felt much better as my libido disappeared. It felt much better than other reboots when I still masturbated (seriously, don't masturbate at all). Porn dreams disappeared. Started to get almost-wet dreams (sexual dreams in which I'm actively trying to get sexual release, but then I wake up with blue balls). I felt more focused in my training. Been more aggressive in getting submissions and fighting them off. My striking has become crisper, but I've also been training more and eating better (which I wouldn't attribute to NoFap). My mind has felt a lot clearer; I feel cognitively sharper. I found myself smiling less, and I felt more ""focused"" (one of my coaches said I looked like I was going to kill someone).

One negative effect is that I've felt the worst writer's block I've ever felt. I've felt much less creative drive to write and think of new ideas. It's been frustrating, and I'm not sure if I'd attribute it to NoFap (I don't believe that NoFap is a panacea for all of life's problems). It still sucks.

As I alluded to earlier, I found myself feeling what I can only describe as ""salty."" I feel more manly and intense. Not really angry, but still. At the 5-week mark I told a few friends that I've gone without sexual release for that time (not really mentioning the porn rebooting). Most of them thought I was insane, and think I'm going to explode. I actually felt really good and calm at the time...

...until this week. I got an email back from a girl I met a few weeks earlier out of the blue. We went back and forth and the conversation did turn a bit sexual, which gave me a damn-near panic attack. Sexual thoughts surfaced in my brain again, although I still kept them under wraps. Still, the prospect of meeting with and having sex with an attractive girl threw my inner calm into the fucking gutter. I kept it cool on the outside, but by the time we met up again I was a nervous, aloof wreck. Nothing sexual happened, and I honestly thought I blew it (I wanted to kiss her but judging from her proximity and body language, it felt like a no-go). But she emailed me right after our date and gave me her number. I texted her a day later, which she hasn't replied to yet. I assume I blew that, but I don't know.

On the psychological side of things, I feel myself actually becoming more socially withdrawn. I'm a natural introvert  , and I've spent the better half of my life trying to accommodate myself to an extroverted society, which has left me rather drained. If anything, not fapping has left me feeling even *less* of a need to mask my natural disposition. Quite honestly, I don't give two fucks about pretending to be a happy, smiling, friendly person. If people are intimidated by me, they can go fuck their mothers. *They're* the ones with the problem, not me.

I caught up with a female friend the other day; we talked for hours and I told her about my giving up masturbation. She was pleasantly surprised, considering that I told her that I was a hornball when we met. We almost went out and I asked her to coffee, but it never materialized. We just opened up to each other for hours, and she forgave me for sending her a lot of weird, sexual texts (and being an overall asshole). She told me that I tend to run away and act aloof around women, which is kind of my defense mechanism. Either way, it felt really good to just open up to a girl, especially an attractive one, and just get to know her. I'd never date her, mostly because she's also a crazy bitch in in her own right. But who am I to judge?

I've been working as a bouncer, and up until this weekend it's been pretty easygoing. This weekend, however, did test my patience. I do get pretty pissy at work (mostly because of the music and the environment, pardon me if I can't stand Nicki Minaj), and I have to deal with drunken assholes all night. I don't really like it there, but I need the money. I don't flirt too much with the women there, although some of them do flirt with me. I don't like the idea of trying to meet women there, mostly because I hate drunk people and I have a difficult time believing that I could meet anyone of value at my workplace. I know I sound like a judgmental prick, but I try not to be. I understand that these people are regular people who work regular jobs, and they're just looking to unwind for a weekend. Still, I deal with people at their very worst with shitty club music decimating my precious eardrums (although I do like ""Boyfriend"" by Justin Bieber).

**Whew**. Wow. I can't believe I got all that off my chest. It's weird; my life is actually not that bad. I start school soon, I'm working on my book, I start an internship, and I'm in pretty good shape. And despite how much I complain, I'm still on this journey, and I know that eventually it'll work out. But right now, it sucks. Thank you for reading.

**TL; DR**: Too fucking bad. Your loss."
yu7eq,5,2012-08-25,Day 90: A Fapless Summer,infinitumz,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/yu7eq/day_90_a_fapless_summer/,"My first post, ever. I am a 20 year old male in my prime, and the world is my oyster. But here I am, at day 90 at last. It was a long journey which was started in late May, after I didn't get the joy out of PMO anymore. I never relapsed, which immensely added to my willpower, and my ego. Somehow, I accidentally stumbled on this sub-reddit (which helped me discover Seddit and MFA as well) and after watching YBOP, I decided to take the challenge up. I thought to myself, ""Hey, might as well do something about it, all that sounds really bad."" Especially the threat of ED.

And so I began. I started fapping since I was 14, and was usually doing it once a day, few times a week, rarely going overboard. Before, I was amazed how I could last a week (before discovering NoFap) and that was probably my longest streak, back in March. I must admit, the urges were the strongest in my first week of NoFap. But after watching my badge number climb steadily, and occupying myself with work it began easier. All that excess energy was converted into staying overtime at work, and even coming in 6 days a week for that sweet extra pay. I was pretty satisfied. On my days off I would usually go biking in the park and along the river, but this has been mandatory for me since I began my transformation into a better person back in 2010.

Ah yes, that takes me back. Back then, I finally decided to stop sitting home, playing CoD and eating all day, and hit the gym at my High School. That gave me a confidence boost, and I have found something to occupy myself with in my past time, such as different hobbies. Working out and biking became mandatory for me, and I even started to learn a new language (italian) and got to go to Italy last year. This year I became more conscious about myself, and dressing well and seduction (MFA and Seddit) became like hobbies for me, due to my involvement. Now of course the transformation is ongoing, and social anxiety became ever more present when I found NoFap. But thanks to this subreddit, I was actually given a way to combat it. Even if many things on here are counted as placebo, I have come to accept that fact a while ago. Getting a little side tracked here, so I'm just gonna quickly outline my journey.

Yes, the urges were the strongest the first week. Yes, I did look at porn, but went through with my willpower and never let anything happen. Yes, I flatlined a few times during the first month. And yes, the urges which can last up to a week are growing weaker, and I'm happy about it. I had wet dreams twice, first time since probably 2008 or 2009. But I blame myself for them, as I watched porn and got very horny before bed, which caused the built up hormones take matters in their own hands. Also, I seem to dream a lot about sex and girls, which is suppose to be normal for someone who has a GF/gets laid a lot (but I don't, still a virgin, hehe).

Confidence boost is clearly noticeable. I no longer shy away from human interaction. I try to go out as much as possible, and meet new people. Eye contact is still a bit of an issue, but I'm working on it. I asked two girls out, and both said no. Since it was a possible option which can be anticipated, I was only slightly disappointing, mainly realizing my mistakes in ""courting"" these girls. But then it made me happy, since I was able to recognize and learn from these mistakes. And the outlook on life for me is once again quite positive, since my biggest annoyance is staying home all day and doing nothing. Now I have the drive to continue my studies in the University, and land that internship for the Spring and Summer terms. I can't wait to go out again and meet new interesting people, and especially girls, which would be everyone's priority on here, right? :)

So as I conclude, I take my hat off for you, wonderful people of the NoFap community. I do not plan on stopping any time soon. I came here countless times when the urges got tough, and my scumbag brain was trying to argue with me. I come here a few times a week to relate to people, and see how the community is doing. Lately, I've witnessed some females taking up NoFap, which means we must be doing pretty damn good to keep attracting so many people into our experiment. And you, smiley faces, keep on going on your journey. This challenge will make you find your inner strength. Make mistakes, learn from them, and finally learn how to be human again."

**About the Organization**

In short, we hold hackathons and a summer program to introduce students to the NYC startup community. 

The hackathons are held twice a year, fall and spring, where students come in from nearby colleges to make something awesome using the APIs demo'ed by NYC startups such as Tumblr, Foursquare, Aviary, 10gen, Etsy, Bit.ly, Boxee, and many many more.

The summer fellowship program invites a group of students to live in NYC for 10 weeks and intern for a startup. Housing is provided and we connect the students with a participating startup company. The students are placed in dorms so they can collaborate on a daily basis. We also host startup founders and friends to come speak to the students about what it's like to run a tech company.


**About Myself**

I've participated in the summer program twice (once as a fellow, and another time as a mentor) where I was lucky enough to work with BuzzFeed and Tumblr. This program has definitely given me the opportunity to explore what happens past college and really put my skills to use. It has also motivated me to become much more attentive to the NYC startup community. I often find myself evangelising the magic of startups to my peers at Rutgers.

I will in and out for most of the afternoon but I'll try to answer your questions as quickly as possible!"
ywiq6,29,2012-08-27,"As an astrophile I get uncomfortable hearing people call Neil Armstrong an 'American hero.' He transcends that, and here's my diary eulogy explaining why",[deleted],space,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/ywiq6/as_an_astrophile_i_get_uncomfortable_hearing/,"*August 26th---In Memoriam*

It was confirmed that today, Neil Armstrong passed away in Blue Ash, OH, due to complications after heart surgery, at age 82. 

On July 20th, 1969, he became the first man to step on the moon, and by extension, the first man to walk on a heavenly body. He and the rest of the *Apollo 11* crew made history by being the first group of people to explore in person another terrestrial body, another world. 

I am unsure whether or not I ought to be considered presumptuous when I say this, but I'm going to go ahead and say it: most people don't understand the gravity of that achievement. 

Under other circumstances, neither would I. But my interest in the sky, in space, in the outside universe was kindled in me when I was a small child. I believe it started first when, while going through some old boxes, my kindergarden teacher, Mrs. Bendick, allowed me to keep a rather battered map of the Solar System taken from an old, lost issue of *National Geographic.* I don't know why---maybe it was a fleeting understanding of the fact that that knowledge, the very *existence* of that map represented some of the highest intellectual achievements in human history, or maybe it was just plain wonder---but I became obsessed with that map. I looked through it on a daily basis, I drew copies of it whenever I was bored (though it was significantly less beautiful drawn by a four year-old on white paper) and I pretty much memorized it. It was then that in my heart I stopped believing in God---for why would anyone care for the ridiculous fairy tales of religion when reality is so much more beautiful, so much more demonstrably elegant and sublime?

I wasn't to be satisfied just there; eventually one day in Sam's Club I spotted a display of books which had on their covers, a vivid picture of a comet. This was The National Audubon Society's *First Field Guide to the Night Sky.* After a bit of asking, turning down copies of Guides to Birds and to Weather, I brought that book home and tore through it, lapping up the history of astronomy, the constellations, the stellar life cycles, the scary concept of a supernova (although I didn't fully grasp how much scarier the next concept---that of black holes---really was,) the Greek mythology, the planets, the moons, the alien stars... everything. And it was so beautifully illustrated! So well! So *wonderful!* And indeed, years later even several thousand miles away, it's still in a revered position in my bookshelf, that book, the one I shall use as a seed to plant the same wonder in some worthy, still unborn child. *That* is destiny, *that* is providence---the transfer of knowledge. 

And yet, I still didn't have much knowledge of *how* we had gained that knowledge, even though I appreciated the results; I did not know the *story* of human space exploration, though I was proud of it. 

That knowledge came from a book I recieved for my fifth birthday from a family friend---for by this time, my space obsession had become apparent to anyone who knew me---the spectacular volume called *The Planets* by McNab and Younger, written to accompany the television series on E! Entertainment. That was the book that did it. That was the book that exalted space exploration, and the book that, to me, proved that human space exploration *should* be  exalted. In it, I met great men, like Roche, Newton, Galileo, Chandrasekhar, Einstein, Le Verrier, Adams, Hershel, Ptolemy, Hubble, Tombaugh, Lowell, Hailley and all the other great figures of astronomy. It told the violent story of the birth of the planets, how they collided in that primordial battlefield, how mere chance (and gravity) sentenced some bodies to a fiery death in the young sun, and others to a ten billion-year life. How *Lunik 1* missed its mark and how it became *Mechta (the Dream)* since it had become the first human object to join the planets. How Tombaugh discovered Pluto by perceiving an infinitesimal difference in two photographic plates at the Lowell Observatory near Flagstaff, Arizona (which, in 2004, I had the great pleasure of visiting.) How people had fantasized for centuries about those channels on Mars and the civilizations thriving in them, and about how this had been disproved; about how our man Neil Armstrong botched the famous line (it should've been ‘One small step for *a* man, one giant leap for mankind';) about how, a PhD intern at NASA discovered the possibility of a grand tour of the solar system for a craft launched in 1976, and how the *Voyager* team, having been denied the funds for a full grand tour, added extra fuel in secret so it could happen anyway; about the temporary fanfare that ensued when, due to a graphical error, the *Viking* probe's first few color pictures of Mars showed Mars to have an Earth like blue sky, instead of the Martian red; how the Hubble telescope researchers decided to test Hubble's capabilities, pointed it in a random seemingly empty direction, and left it on during Christmas break and returned to find the famous photo of the Hubble Deep Field; how in the 1990s, years after its last significant photographs, *Voyager II}*sent back photos of the solar system, revealing us to be insignificant specks of light; of all this and more, and how (this time implicitly) these all ought to be thought of as humanity's greatest achievements. Because, you see, everything else in human history will be forever chained to this planet, and when the time comes, will die with it. Because space travel is the mark of a technologically advanced species. Because *Voyager II* will live longer than the human race, out there in that perfect vacuum. Of how many fields can *that* be said?

Which brings us back to Neil Armstrong. He was as I said, the first man to walk upon another heavenly body. That's not a once-in-a-century achievement. That's not a once-in-a-millennium achievement. That's the sort of achievement, an achievement of such magnitude, that it occurs once in *human history.* We may do more difficult things, set foot on more distant worlds---after all, the titles for being the first on another planet, in another star system, in another galaxy, in another supercluster of galaxies and (perhaps) in another universe are still open (and only the latter would be the one to match Armstrong's achievement)---but as it stands, Armstrong will be nearly impossible to match. Because he was the first on another world. 

*And he got there using a computer with all the intelligence of a modern watch.*

His achievement is one of those achievements, achievements of the distant past---the first human to cross over to Australia from Africa, the first human to cross the Atlantic,  the first to encircle the globe---*those* men, *they* are the company of Armstrong. And only a few more humans will ever join them. And losing one of that company, in your lifetime, *should* cause you distress, and if not, it is only your own soul you will be betraying. 

He transcends the here and now, he transcends national borders, transcends time; he is immortal, and has passed into the domain of legend. He was human spirit incarnate. "

Long story short, I have received an internship offer, it is a great job, but I would have to move to a town that has a population of 3000 people . I've been told there is a very very very small Muslim population there (I currently live in a town with 700 000+ and a majority Muslim population).... thus it would be extremely difficult to obtain Halal food. 


Most of my friends and some family have been saying, well if you are in that situation you can eat the meat, just say Bismillah before you do. On the other hand, I have never had any intentions of doing that, I was preparing myself for a vegetarian and fish diet for my duration in that city. I know it is permissible to eat the meat if you have no other alternatives, but am not sure if that only pertains to meat alternatives or food alternatives in general. My mother is a vegetarian and she does not eat meat; so it is possible to live off that diet (obviously). I still have full intentions of only eating Halal meat, and just wanted to get /r/islam's opinion on this.

yzkxg,5,2012-08-28,"I want to go on a 1,500 mile, month long bike tour. I'm a broke ass college student. Help?",EpicSchwinn,whichbike,https://www.reddit.com/r/whichbike/comments/yzkxg/i_want_to_go_on_a_1500_mile_month_long_bike_tour/,"My girlfriend is going to have an internship out of town this summer, so I'm looking at this summer as my last of true freedom before I have to do internships and do grownup stuff all summer for a while.

My plan is a month-long tour through the South. My plan is to ride to Nashville, take the Natchez Trace Parkway to Mississippi, meander down the roads by the Mississippi River to New Orleans, head east along the Gulf to Pensacola, north through Alabama visiting some of their colleges along the way, back into Tennessee through Chattanooga and Sewanee, then home.

Along with this tour, I'll use this bike for some touring training trips and for commuting to get my legs up to snuff. AH, this will be easy! Long Haul Trucker it is!

My only issue though is that a Long Haul Trucker is a thousand bucks. As much as I would love to, I can't do that. I'm thinking more along the lines of $500. This puts me in the MTB market, I'm thinking.

My top choice currently is [the Diamondback Response](http://www.dickssportinggoods.com/product/index.jsp?productId=11492818). I would get some road tires, an Old Man Mountain rack with nice panniers, nice pedals, and some clip on fenders. I'm looking at getting the warranty on the bike as well. It's a department store bike which worries me, but Dick's will replace or repair anything for free with the plan. I think that it would come out very profitably for me if I end up putting 5k-10k miles on the bike in 2 years. Also, I'm 250 lbs (but decreasing!) so that is thrown into the equation as well.

If it matters, I currently have a Ross Professional Gran Tour that I converted to FG and currently use for everything.


TL;DR: I need a bombproof bike that I can commute and tour on through college. I expect to ride this thing into the ground or until I get a Long Haul Trucker, whichever comes first."
yyyi8,14,2012-08-28,How did you get started?,[deleted],Paleo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paleo/comments/yyyi8/how_did_you_get_started/,"I was hoping to hear some stories on how people heard of and started the Paleo diet.

For me, it started around July 2011 when I went on my first internship and realized I seriously needed to lose weight. I switched from ""college food"" to what I thought was healthy (whole grains, less fatty foods, etc.) and started exercising. 

After a month of this, I saw very little change and started getting very frustrated. Soon after, I had met up with an old friend that I didn't see for about a year. I didn't even recognize the guy since he lost so much weight. He never mentioned anything about his diet/weight loss, and I remember thinkink to myself, ""man, he looks like he's been on drugs for the last year!""

I finally asked him where all the weight went, and he responded with, ""I'm on the caveman diet. I only eat food that is natural. A LOT of meat, with some fruits and vegetables. Most people think that eating the way I do is unhealthy, but it is what humans are made for. You can't go out in the wild and find bread."" 

After he left that night, I did some research on ""the caveman diet"", and the light bulb suddenly turned on. It just makes SO much sense. I turned my diet around that week. The rest of my 6 month internship I was eating eggs, meats, vegetables, fruits, nuts, and continued my exercise. Turned down MULTIPLE offerings for donuts, pizza, and the typical office free food, and got many weird look/comments from my co-workers.

I went back to school after that internship 55lbs. lighter, with much more muscle mass. The first day my college roommate saw me, the first words that came out of his mouth were, ""dude...you're looing pretty skinny."" My classmates as well as professors all commented on my weight loss as well for the rest of that week. ""Man, you look like a totally differen't person!"" I knew I did something right.

It's amazing what you can do with the proper diet and exercising in such little time. Fuck yeah, Paleo."

They all seemed a little shy except for this one girl. Prolly one of the hottest girls I've ever seen. We chatted a bit and it turns out she used to live in the same town I currently live in. She seemed really into me. When we were touring the facility, she seemed to go out of her way to stand by me and right in front of me, like really close like she wanted me to put my arms around her or something. I wanted to approach her after class and get her number but had to stay and ask the instructor about a possible internship. When she was leaving we made eye contact that I immediately broke because she caught me off guard. Fuck.

I'm 27 in a class full of 18 to early 20 year olds. Although I think this hot girl might be a little older because she stated she interned before she came to this school. Now, I could easily pass as a 21-23 year old but I don't want to lie. Age will most likely be brought up in class due to the fact that its a communications class and we'll be discussing passed and future generations, etc. 

Should I just be confident about my age? Or just lie about it? As you can tell I'm very new to this. I'm pretty introverted.

Also, how should I approach this girl? How would you approach this situation? Next class I plan to sit next to her (and steal another girl's seat in the process.) 

Any tips/advice is greatly appreciated :)"
yy0ut,19,2012-08-28,I feel music again!,For_Death_and_Glory,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/yy0ut/i_feel_music_again/,"**I apologize for the length- I didn't realize I had this much to say!**

Quick back-story: I am 21 and had been fapping nearly every day since I was about 12. For all of high school, music was my drug of choice (besides fapping), and I was very passionate about it. I even taught myself to play a bit of guitar. When I got to college I was introduced to marijuana and quickly learned that it combined quite well with music, food, and fapping.

When I found this subreddit I began to learn a little more about dopamine and our brains' reward system. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but from what I understand, the acts of fapping, smoking marijuana, and eating junk food strongly increase the brain's desire for more dopamine. I also know that the chills we get from listening to great music can be attributed to dopamine.

During the summer of 2011 I got myself into a truly terrible routine. I worked as a cashier at a supermarket during the days, but then the night was a whole different story. Instead of looking to go out with friends, I would come home, get really high, set myself up with a fine assortment of munchies, and then either listen to music or watch tv. And then to wrap-up the night, I would find some nice porn to fap to and have an explosion of ecstasy into a Kleenex. I went through this routine *at least* 4-5 times a week for nearly 3 months!

Consequently, my junior year of college was utterly unsuccessful and it was pretty clear that I had social inability and no self-confidence. My grades were great, but my social life was clearly in the toilet. But what **scared me the most** was the fact that the appreciation and enjoyment I had once had for music was nearly GONE. Everything I listened to sounded stale and boring. Getting chills and emotions was a rarity. As someone who had claimed music as my religion for so long, this was truly saddening. This decline in enjoyment definitely happened over time (in college in general).

Fast forward to now. I am currently on my longest no-fap streak since the day I found internet porn, and I feel so much better in many ways. When I stopped fapping, I starting working out, eating healthier, and excelling at my internship. However, the greatest thing to happen so far is the incredible spike in musical interest. The chills and emotions are BACK! I feel like I'm falling in love with music all over again. 

In conclusion, I truly believe that the repeated combination of junk food, marijuana, porn, and social inactivity completely ruined my brain's reward system and numbed the effect and power beautiful music had on me. I am very grateful to be enjoying music yet again.

Thanks for reading, and I hope my tale will inspire others to continue with me on the road to 90 days and beyond.

* So my question is, how hard is to get into a public accounting firm considering I’ve been out of college for 2 years don’t have a CPA(but am eligible) but have worked at a doctor’s office.  I know I won’t be able to get into the big 4 as they are very hard to get into so is it possible for me to get into any other public accounting firms and is it still better than going to a private firm. I would be willing to intern if that is even possible now.

So I was wondering if anyone knows any companies in Vancouver that would hire an intern so I can get some experience.  I graduated from University of Fraser Valley in Abbotsford with a CIS degree, and it seems every job requires a year of experience, and even junior positions require some form of coop; so I'm out of ideas.  Any help would be great."

I'm visiting Pittsburgh for the next 3 months (starting mid-september), and I have looked and looked but can't seem to find a place to stay. Do you know any subletters or something, in Pittsburgh? Even a temporary place to for the first week or so would be nice.

I'm visiting Pittsburgh because I have a 3 month internship at CMU, doing research in computer science.

Any help would be appreciated.

z1nao,0,2012-08-29,Any ideas of a cheap place to get a gaming laptop (or to build one)?,LOWBACCA,gaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/z1nao/any_ideas_of_a_cheap_place_to_get_a_gaming_laptop/,"To simply put it, I need to leave next month overseas for a 3 month internship, and I need to get a cheap laptop over there. Currently, I game on a desktop, which I just planned on taking with me, but I have been finding out that it's going to cost me 300+ just to ship my tower, not considering all my other stuff including my monitor. Sadly though, my laptop is from '06, so it doesn't offer me much help in terms of keeping me busy while I'm in a foreign country and all my friends are back here sleeping when I'm awake. :( 

So, I figure it will just be cheapest to buy a laptop and take that with me. It's an unpaid internship, so money is tight as it is, but does anyone know of a place I could get a laptop that could at least handle most games on a low setting? Or a cheap way to ship over my desktop? I can't put it in my suitcase.

I recognize this as a great source of community, support, and information for homebrewing, so, when I can, I like to try and reach out to you guys! I try to keep it to PMs, but sometimes a post is more suitable. But anyways...

I recently have been working with Ken Schwartz, designer of the Son of a Fermentation Chamber, to feature the SoaFC in an HomebrewersAssociation.org Pimp My System feature (a DIY based feature). Ken and I thought it would be a lot more interesting to display SoaFC pictures submitted by people who have done the build themselves, as opposed to just showing a picture of mine or Ken's builds. 

SO! show me your SoaFC. You can link them in this post or PM them to me. 

Thanks in advance, and I hope to hear from some of you out there!

Her optimism clicked so perfectly with my pessimism.
We dated for about 3 months, and we both had the best time of our lives.
This might sound like nothing, and it really isn't, but our relationship was so good, I could see myself spending lots of years with her.

On the end of our year, we both had to do an internship.
I got a job in Stockholm, and she was going to France.
We both said that cheating was completely out of the picture, and it was, for me.

She came back today and in all joy I went to her house, and there she told me she had slept with a guy she met there, and became really good friends.
So good that she had developed some feelings for him.

She told me that he reminded her of me.
During the begin of the internship we were having really good contact, an were skyping almost everyday.
during half of the internship, this is after 5 weeks, we were having a bit less contact and she was responding less.

She told me she kissed with him once, and later she slept with him once.
She said she was forgetting me.

I'm not even that upset with the fact she slept with someone else, but that it happend about a week before she would see me again.
Oh, and she invited him over.

I hope some people will read this and be able to give me some advice.
Please tell me if you have any questions about the story, I probably didn't wrote everything down.

z18vq,2,2012-08-29,Self Editorial - Skilled worker shortage - I'm calling bullshit. ,jjandre,politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/z18vq/self_editorial_skilled_worker_shortage_im_calling/,"I've gotten real tired of the job hunt. It's worse now than it's ever been, but for me it has always seemed cyclical. Every few years, I'd get downsized, or let go or laid off or whatever euphemism is popular at the time, and, to use bad metaphors, I'm cast into the wind, searching for the next port in the storm. 

It's been like this since I have been a working adult. You find something that you hope is stable and you hang on doing the best you can, and after a few years everything gets restructured and you find your whole world in chaos. I've gone through it four times now. It's made me sick every time, damaged my credit, put my financial stability at rick, almost made me lose my house. It's demoralizing and it hurts very deeply. But what's worse is what comes after your company lets you go.

You're sorta just left in your damaged state to pick up the pieces and start again. You tell yourself that it's an opportunity. That you didn't really want to be part of a company that never really realized your true value to begin with. Saying that might help your family, but it doesn't help you. Not really. Because you don't believe it. The worst part is, now you have to start looking again, and your heart hopes that you don't lose ground. How insulting would it be if you suddenly found yourself earning what you were earning 15 years ago, or even less.

I can tell you from personal experience; That is a very real possibility. It jars you at first, and scares you. Your pride wants you to hold out, longer and longer until your finances are so fragile any bump in the road could shatter them. Then you relent and decide to settle for whatever you can get. Screw the dreams, screw the pride, it's just about eating now. 

But what really, and I mean really bothers me, hurts me to my core is I think companies contribute to the problem. Not only do I believe they they contribute to it, but that they actively seek to make the problem worse. 

I could go in fifty different direction with this on how companies are making things worse for workers, but I'd like to focus on a lie that keeps getting repeated. ""There's a shortage of skilled workers."" I will now generalize based on just my own experience, but I've come to understand that most employers want to be able to hire somebody that's ready to go the first week. They want productivity to continue, and they don't want to pay for it. 

I keep hearing the ""shortage of skilled workers"" mantra repeated in the media, and it just makes me angry. While I was out searching for a job the other day, I heard it repeated several times in this segment of the Diane Rehm show: http://thedianerehmshow.org/shows/2012-08-27/manufacturing-and-regulations It makes me angry because I've applied to numerous positions that I was capable of doing only to be rejected for lacking 6, 8, 10 years of experience. How are you supposed to get 10 years of experience in a highly specialized job? What's going to keep you in one of these positions for 10 years anyway if they're not paying a living wage?

The pundits were tying it to regulations that harm medium to large manufacturers. I just sat there and yelled ""BULLSHIT!"" at my radio. We are in a recovery period of a deep recession. Large numbers of Americans are out of work, and they're trying to say that the only thing keeping them from working is their ignorance? The workforce and the unemployed all spend a great deal of resources and time taking classes, earning certifications, going to college, training in the Armed Forces, participating in government programs, taking unpaid internships, studying online etc. Is that not preparing people for jobs?

The taxpayers spend a lot on training people. Workers spend a lot on training themselves. Even some companies invest in training. The problem is, we have a glut of companies that do not invest in the workforce. They don't even want to pay living wages, let alone absorb the cost of training someone to do the work. There's a lot of people out there without jobs that are educated, have plenty of skills, are perfectly trainable, but their flaw is not being ready to go on day one. 

If you don't want to invest an ounce in getting them ready to work and don't want to pay what they're worth to keep them, then do not complain that there are no skilled workers out there."

z0v44,8,2012-08-29,I secretly hate everyone I know. ,yourenotagoodegg12,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/z0v44/i_secretly_hate_everyone_i_know/,"I have a best friend who’s constantly one-sidedly competitive. Ran a mile? She ran two. Won a round of beer pong? She won four. Had a cute guy hit on you? Her guy was cuter. Scored a sweet internship? Her career path is more lucrative.  This is constant; it’s as if you can’t mention a single accomplishment without receiving a backhanded compliment.

The other girls I’m friends with have most likely befriended me out of convenience. Do you know how people sometimes say that attractive people tend to flock together? It’s true and I can’t help but feel as if most of them have only attempted to place me in their assortment of beautiful people.  I don’t think many of them truly care about me; I’m only important when they want to go to bars or get into clubs. They’ve complimented my appearance more times than they’ve ever commented on my intellect or personality.

Most men never seem to want to befriend me. Most men never seem to want to talk to me. Someone once repeated that trite line: “Oh, it’s because they’re intimidated”. My best friend rolled her eyes.

When men are interested, they comment: “You’re so distant. I just can’t seem to understand you.” They place me on the pedestal, like I’m someone who’s magically above it all; I don’t even know that fucking means. Maybe they don’t either. 

I’m fucking lonely, but I don't want anything to do with any of these people.

z0o8r,19,2012-08-29,Me[24] and gf[21] fight CONSTANTLY and now shes making it physical.,idontknowwhattodo88,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z0o8r/me24_and_gf21_fight_constantly_and_now_shes/,"I'm a 24/M she's a 21/F. Been together 11 months. Well, ever since we moved in together 3 months ago, we have been fighting non stop. She is clinically depressed and has told me she was bipolar before. Well about 2 months ago, she started to make our arguments turn physical. Now let me state, I NEVER am physical with her, I pretty much just take it and assess the damage afterwards. She always says she's sorry afterwards, to which I usually say ""no you're fucking not, you do it all the time."" She also usually tries to subconsciously justify it by saying I ""mentally abuse her"" which she pretty much considers anything to be that may be a personal attack against her during an argument.

Well last night, after she went through her usual physical abusive bullshit, I snapped and said ""hit me again"" assuming she would back down. She didn't. She latched on to my face, arms, ears, and back with her nails as deep as she could. My face and the inside of my ear started bleeding in multiple places. It's so bad I can't even go to work today because I work for my parents and I don't feel like explaining to them in detail(they already know the basics) about how my girlfriend feels its perfectly ok to make me bleed every time an argument gets to intense for her taste. So that's great, I am now losing money over this.

To make matters worse, she starts wailing and crying uncontrollably in about 99% of the arguments, bad enough that the police actually came one day. I'm pretty neighbors think I beat the shit out of her because this too, because the lady across the hallway won't even say a word to me, not even a head nod back when we walk past each other.

I don't know what to do, we have a lease together because we were never like this. Sure we argued some times but she never was abusive physically like she is now. I want it to get better, I hoped it would get better before I left the country for this 3 month internship I have next month, but I know that's out of the question now. She won't let us see relationship counseling because she is broke and she won't see counselling for her depression that even she acknowledges that she has for the same reasons.

I want this to work. I know I sound like the typical abused SO, but I do. I just don't know how any more. This isn't the first time she made me bleed, just not this bad. She's bruised me up pretty bad before too. The irony is she had someone beat her before, and would always talk about how shitty he was, yet she beats me more than he ever beat her.

I know I jumped on the lease way too early (less than one year), but I wanted to make sure she had a stable place to live at once I left for my internship, and her own place. We even got a cat! But it's all spiraling downhill. We even made plans to go on a trip before I leave to celebrate our one year aniversary, but I'm already having to pay $100 plus more than her at least and to top it all off she's doing stuff that restrains me from going to work.

Tl;Dr: My girlfriend has turned this relationship into a physically abusive relationship. Tries to justify this by playing the victim to emotional abuse. It's getting worse and worse and showing no chance of stopping. I don't know what to do.

EDIT: Just to add in, she has a past that I'm not proud of at all. I will admit that I sometimes use this against her, but it torments me. 

SECOND EDIT: I explained to her that she has to regularly see counselling or we are done. She explained that she couldn't afford it and I said make it happen. She decided to see her doctor today. This seems like a step in the right direction.

THIRD EDIT: Girlfriend just went to her family doctor, who prescribed to her an antidepressent until she can see a psychiatrist. I'm not sure how to look at this. She took them before she met me and I told her that I would have preferred for her NOT to take them because I was afraid of her changing. But now, she has changed already. So I guess I can't really use that logic any more."

We have been going out for six months now.

We often spend a lot of time together just talking, watching movies, streams, playing games. Just last Wednesday we talked for over 1.5 hours. We are comfortable with each other sexually and open about our masturbation habits, occasionally helping each other. Our relationship was strong and we were very close. At the beginning of our relationship, I was in school and was able to spend a large amount of time with her everyday. Since the summer started and I started working at an internship, I have not been able to spend weekdays with her for about 7 weeks. During that time we often spent entire weekends together. My internship ended this week and I looked forward to spending the rest of my summer with her until school started again.

However, since the past four days, she has been ignoring me. This is unusual as we rarely do not talk to each other for more than a day or two at a time. She has not made any attempt to talk to me, despite my making myself completely available. When I tried to start talking to her, she tells me how tired she is all the time, half-assing conversations, and abruptly dropping our conversations in the middle of them. This is troubling because she talks to other friends and spends a large amount of time playing online games with another guy. I asked her one day to hang out and have a movie date with me and I waited for her to become available only for her to cancel on me at the last second. I feel extremely unsettled by this and suspect she has lost interest in me. I have not confronted her about this and we have not talked in two days.

I've been preparing myself for the worst these past couple of days. I know that I have to talk to her and ask her what's going on and whether or not she wishes to continue our relationship. I'm just not sure what exactly to say and when is a good time to say it. I think this Friday, a good solid week since she started ignoring me is an alright time but I've heard that I should talk to her as soon as possible. I'm very confused about what exactly to do.

I'm looking for any advice or experience reddit can share with me to guide me through these hard times.

I've been dating my SO for almost 5 years now, and we've always had a pretty awesome sex life. Lately, though, when we have PIV sex he comes in about 30 seconds. During oral he can last for a seemingly indefinite period of time, but pretty much as soon as we switch, he comes.

This summer, he had an internship across the country and partway through the summer I visited him for 2 weeks. We had sex almost every day and everything was great, PIV lasted a satisfyingly long time (even longer than usual at some times.) He's been back for a week and a half now and every time we've had sex we've had the same problem. 

Does anyone have any idea why this would be happening now? Everything was fine before. It seems like something's wrong but I don't know what it could be :("

Instead of dealing with that thought I just locked it away, telling myself 'let the good thing last as long as it can.'  Seemed reasonable but I got addicted to her, and she to me.

She helped me through my bipolar diagnosis, I helped her through her post-assault PTSD diagnosis.  She'd have panic attacks, I'd calm her down, I'd fall into a depression, she'd help me remember what life was like.  But then she'd yell at me over little things, for not meeting her outside when she got to my house.  Then I couldn't talk to her because I'd be so deep in my shell, and I'd lose my self control when I was manic.

The sex we had was awe inspiring.  Two crazy people who's only sanity was found in each other's embrace.  All the pent up emotion, the stress of living and release of the intense self control each day required, we let go together and each of us knew what the other was feeling.  One being, one soul found in two bodies temporarily one.

But then I'd move the wrong way and she'd feel pain, and blame me for hurting her.  Or I'd stress about the day, slide into depressive thoughts and lose my desire for her.  Every embrace, every kiss, every heavy heave was wrought with the tension of 'what will go wrong this time.'

Despite weekly fights, we truly helped each other.  I am back in school and her panic attacks are gone.  We knew we had each other, and ourselves, to thank, and we took joy in it.  We kept fighting.

But we were scared to be alone, so we'd stay together to ease our fears.  Then we'd fight again, and we'd talk about how the fights were becoming too much.  We'd have sex, fall in love all over again, and fight the next week.  Eventually they became too much, we said enough is enough, and broke up.

(Please reread the previous paragraph a dozen more times before moving on.)

The last time I saw her was the first time in months.  She had an internship in my town, we'd see each other often, it seemed so perfect.  We were going to figure something out, deal with the fall later, what mattered was that we wanted to have each other.

Then she met someone else, she didn't even have the guts to tell me.  I called her out on it, she said nothing.  Three days later I got a text message, the last thing she ever said to me.

""Happy 4th of July!  I'll call you in the next couple of days, I promise.""


I still haven't replied.


Fuck you Jaime, I deserve better."

z3o16,2,2012-08-30,How do you maintain a healthy sex life with your SO when you both have busy schedules?,embraun,sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/z3o16/how_do_you_maintain_a_healthy_sex_life_with_your/,"My SO (21M) and I (20F) have been dating 5 years and are going to be incredibly busy this upcoming semester of college. It's our last year before we graduate, but it's going to be a tough one. Not only are we both full-time students, but we both have jobs as well.

I go to school in NYC, but due to financial/personal reasons my final year of school I'm now living at home in NJ and commuting into the city every day. I'm a full-time student (with all night classes to accomodate my work schedule), I have an internship and I have an actual paid job. All three of these things are located in NYC. This means most days I'll be leaving very early in the morning to catch the train and coming home somewhat late at night. I can already foresee this schedule is going to be incredibly difficult for me to maintain and having enough energy to then maintain a healthy sex life on top of that is going to be even more difficult.

My SO is also a fulltime student and will be working 4 days a week. So we're both going to be busy with work/school 6 days a week. The problem is that our days off don't overlap. So the one day I have off a week, he works. The one day off a week he has, I work. 

On top of all of this, we're living with his parents and his younger sister (17F). I'm pulling my hair out over this because I've always been a very independent and private person and having to rely on his parents for housing is kind of a blow to my ego. I lived on my own and paid my own way for my first 3 years of college, but I realized living paycheck to paycheck wasn't going to leave any money left over to go into my savings so I sucked it up and moved back home. I know lots of people still live with their parents and this shouldn't be a big deal, but a part of me can't wait for the moment where my SO and I can move out and get our own place.

So not only do we both have incredibly busy schedules, but we're living in the same house as his parents. Finding time for sex is going to be hard. And finding the energy to have sex after a long day of work and school is going to be even harder.

I also have a low sex drive and my SO has a much higher sex drive. When I get caught up in all the things I have to do, I could potentially go weeks without sex and it isn't until my SO kind of nudges me and goes ""hey it's been awhile..."" that I have to sit down and realize more time has passed than I thought.

So the questions I have are: What are things we can do to keep the romance going when we're both going to be two pretty tired college kids? How do we get around living with his parents in the same house as us?

z2rl3,1,2012-08-30,"[21M] First relationship, first breakup, struggling a little now.",[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/z2rl3/21m_first_relationship_first_breakup_struggling_a/,"Please excuse the rant, I've not really had anywhere to write this down or tell anyone the full details yet, so it could be quite long. Me [21] and my girlfriend [19] just split up after what I can only describe as the time of my life. 

From everything I can think about, it was a movie romance to describe it, we were sort of ""will they, won't they"" for a bit after she was hurt before. It was difficult at the start because she had enough baggage to fill an entire fucking arrivals hall, and it was killing me a little because I fell for her pretty much straight away, but I helped her through it as best I could. It was moderately long distance, but I didn't mind driving over to her at all. We kept it a secret from everyone to begin with because where we worked, if there was gossip, it spread like wildfire and we didn't want that. 

Eventually, 6 months or so later, after the most incredible day together [I can still remember it like it was yesterday and it still makes me a bit woozy], I told her I loved her and vice versa after weeks and weeks of both of us clearly holding it back [even letting it slip accidentally here and there], but this was the first sincere time and we finally made it official. 

The next year was incredible, like I said, time of my life, we did everything together and were completely inseparable. We were there for the biggest moments in each other's lives, such as her 18th, her moving into Uni, my 21st, my graduation, etc. We had little arguments here and there, but I'm proud that we never had a screaming row or anything. But then it started to get a little off, since I was just finishing Uni and had dissertation and exams and stuff and we had less time for each other than before. She got an internship over the summer which meant she'd be working 9-5 every day and the rent on my student house ran out meaning I had to move back home, putting us much further away than before. I'm just about to start a graduate job too, which meant moving to a different city about 2 hours away by train, and I know that this weighed really heavily on her mind for the last part of it. The problem then was it stopped being such a whirlwind romance and slowed down a bit, which I think made it feel a little stale compared to what it used to be.

Anyway, we had a bit of an off weekend a while ago, and we took a bit of a break [only for a week], but when we were chatting at the end of it, she revealed she'd been speaking to a guy from her work [clearly something was going on there because she felt it was important enough to mention it], and it just broke all the trust I had in her. I tried to finish it with her then and there, but she broke down on the phone and begged me not to, and I wasn't ready to give up on us yet, so I gave her another chance and she drove the 3 hours to see me right there and then [at midnight on a work day, she took the next day off to spend together]. We talked all through the night and it felt like we'd worked out all of our problems and it was going to be okay. Two days later, I headed off on holiday for a fortnight and by the end, I couldn't wait to get back to her and be in her arms again. She met me at the airport with the biggest grin on her face and we were completely loved up again in the car back home. But then, we got back and something trivial suddenly darkened her mood and all of a sudden she dropped it on me that she just felt like our relationship had peaked and we should break up before we ruined the bad memories by dragging it out. I didn't really react much inside, but just sort of agreed with it and she left my house then and there.

Fast forward to the next day, she texts me asking me how I am, so I reply in a civil manner, if not how I used to, but then all of a sudden she replied telling me she's not stopped loving me and the last year was the proudest year of her life and how she still wants to talk because we know each other better than anyone else. I cracked and replied that I felt the same and I'd always care for her, you know, standard soppy stuff. Then she replied saying that we really couldn't have worked better as a couple and she blamed circumstances more than either of us and who knows what could happen in the future and that she needs space but would call me at some point.

Now, my problem is that I really did love this girl and I know it's a first love so it's probably the worst it'll ever be, but I'm really struggling to accept that it's completely over now. I know that she's going to be moving to the same city as me for a work placement next July, and I'm just wondering whether it's worth keeping any hope in me for then, since we both said throughout our entire relationship that we'd cut it if it ever looked like going bad, but we could both see a future together somewhere down the line, if not immediately. I do really want her back, but realise that we might just need a bit of time and space to ourselves for a while, but is it worth it? 

More than anything, I can only think about the last text she sent me before we broke off contact which was ""'You know it's love when all you want is that person to be happy, even if you're not part of that happiness' I love you x"". I completely understand what she means, and if me and her never work out again, fine, but I just want her to be happy in whatever. She's an incredibly attractive girl, so attracts all the worst kind of guys, but I couldn't bear to think that someone's going to hurt her soon, and I don't know of a way to get over that feeling. I'd love to be the guy that makes her smile her amazing smile again, but if not, I really hope that she finds someone that can. Sob sob."
z2d7t,3,2012-08-30,"My boyfriend [22] of three years just broke up with me [20] on the eve of moving in together because it was ""best for me."" But it wasn't.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z2d7t/my_boyfriend_22_of_three_years_just_broke_up_with/,"I've been with my boyfriend for three years now. We have had some very rough patches. He cheated on me while drunk a few years ago, but was honest about it and was genuinely remorseful for his actions. I forgave him and we moved on (or so I thought) and improved ourselves. I trust him completely. 

We've lived together for the entire duration of our relationship (we met because he lived across the hall from my first dorm room) barring summer breaks and stuff like that, so I've gotten very used to having him around constantly. I wouldn't have it any other way. When we're together, things are generally awesome. We get along very well, have similar hobbies, have meshed our friend circles seamlessly. However, in any period of separation, things seem to fall to shit.

As I said earlier, he cheated on me once during winter break. He thought we were breaking up because I was so angry about something (I can't even remember what now) and was drunk and high and slept with a girl at a party. I somehow knew instinctively that his had happened, and when he told me when we met again, I had already come to terms with it. He suggested that we should break up because he had hurt me so grievously, but I convinced him that I was a big girl and that if we were able to work on ourselves, we'd be okay. We stayed together.

That summer, we were only able to meet once due to our weird schedules and locations. He was incredibly depressed that summer because his family had just moved, he was lonely, and was doing an internship that was particularly soul-draining. When we visited, it was obvious that he was stressed out, but we had fun anyway. We parted  and I was very confident in our relationship, but a week later, he broke up with me. I was begging him to contact me more often, he got upset, called me, and broke up with me. I was devastated. I later found out that he had this planned for some time because he had changed his housing to be further from me in the coming school year and it really hurt that he'd still invite me to visit when he knew it was ending. 

But, when school started, we resumed sleeping together and he just kind of moved in again. We were never dating officially, but we were definitely more than friends with benefits. 

We just graduated this year and we have been doing really well. I was super confident in our relationship. I thought that he might even marry me. I visited him a few weeks ago and there was such love in his eyes and every moment of that trip was fun. I felt like it was all perfect. He asked me to move in with him this fall when he buys a house and I got a puppy and everything was sounding so amazing.

But just like last August, a few weeks after visiting, I asked him why we couldn't talk on the phone more often, and he broke up with me. This time he's stressed out because he has an extremely demanding job, lost out on a really awesome house, and is essentially homeless.

Every time we break up it's the same story: He feels like he has hurt me too much in the past and that I deserve better. I cannot tell you how much this enrages me. He apparently senses some infinite sadness within me when I look at him and it tears him apart. I don't understand. I was the happiest when I was in his arms. Any emotion behind my eyes was love. 

He also feels like he is not romantic enough and that we don't partake in enough of my hobbies (even though I have never expressed this or felt this in any way. I thought he was romantic and that we did do things I liked a lot).

He explained to me that having me move in would be ""signing his marriage license"" and he is not ready for that (okay, I understand that completely) and that if he were one of my friends, he'd be angry that I'm dating him because he's so terrible.

This sounds like a self-esteem issue to me. He is interpreting my emotions as disdain or pain, right? Does that sound right? He's really hard on himself and is constantly trying to change himself. He always says he is unsure of who he is, so the self-esteem issue makes sense to me.

But it infuriates me because he's giving me no choice here. He's not even listening to me when I say that I'm not hurting. I'm hurting now that this has happened, but I was honestly very, very happy with him.

He said he loves me, that we're best friends, that he would probably have married me if I came along in ten years, but that he's hurt me too much.

Is this some weird man code? Or is he really that self-loathing? Is this just some weird way of saying, ""I am not ready?"" Is he just stressed out? I get that he is wary of moving in together when we're so young, but why dump me? We've lived together for three years and that went fine. Why can't I just live in a different place and visit when I can we'll be like a normal young couple?

The problem is that I'm completely broke and have no assistance whatsoever from my family. I don't have a car and am unable to work in the town I'm currently living because the job market is so saturated and I live in the middle of no where with no transportation. I will also be homeless soon. Thinking that we were going to move in together, I put all of my funds into buying house things for us and paying off bills and student loans. We agreed months ago that I would work on the house and unpack and stuff for the first few weeks while job searching, and then begin a part-time job so that I wasn't a total mooch. Then, hopefully, after I saved up for a car, I could get a big job in another part of the city. But now that we've broken up, he said it's no longer a good idea for me to live with him because we ""can't be just friends and he's not going to break up with me again."" But I'm so stuck. He has realized that he kind of lead me into this weird financial situation and has offered to give me $200 or so a month for three months to live with a friend until I get on my feet, but that seems so wrong and none of my friends are okay with me moving in. I broke it to him last night that I was having no luck finding people to live with and he said that maybe I could just stay with him for a month. 

I love him and would give anything to be back with him. He knows this. He also knows that a month living together would mean sex and probably having to reevaluate our relationship again. It's blowing my mind that he is considering letting me stay with him for any amount of time. Does he know what he's doing and is weirdly getting back together with me, or is he just trying to help me out financially since I was banking so hard on this working out?

I'm having such a hard time understanding any of this. I've never been broken up with out of love and I'm unsure if that is even possible (maybe I'm just a selfish person, I don't know). Why are my feelings not considered -- don't I know what I want too? I love him and I'm strong - that's why I forgive him. I chose this for myself. Am I wrong to feel slightly disrespected? Is all of this just some elaborate ploy to not get tied down at a young age? If so, why then, am I most likely going to be living with him?

Most importantly, though, is if we do get back together, can something like this be fixed? How do I approach this subject? Is it just how he's wired? Is he just depressed?

Jeez, that was long. I'm bad at explaining this. I'm sorry it was so long.

**TL;DR**: Boyfriend broke up with me because he was afraid he was hurting me too much when he wasn't hurting me at all. Is it low self-esteem or something else?"

I""ll be moving to Albuquerque in December, thanks to my dad's job being moved, and am very heavily leaning towards a CS degree. I'm a senior in high school (yes, my senior year will be split between two schools). 

I did an internship with a local software development company here in Lincoln, Nebraska, primarily in C#, but also included WPF. 

I am still considering the University of Washington in Seattle, we flew up there to visit and were blown away by how good the program is, but for cheaper tuition for me, it'd mean gaining residency in Washington State. It's not impossible, but the school makes it sound impossible. The requirements are to live there a year, and established a bonifide domocile (close all legal ties with other states, and file your tax returns in WA). 

So, in curiosity, what's UNM's Computer Science program like? Hopefully its leaps and bounds above UNL's program here. I know Intel is in Albuquerque, as well as Sandia and Los Alamos.

My girlfriend and I had been dating for 2 years.  It's always been a dream of hers to join Peace Corps.  The opportunity came, and she left 7/23 (month ago) for Africa.

Before she left, she agreed to pay for half of airfare for me to make a trip out to visit her (context:  she held a very good full time job and lived at home, so saved, prior to leaving.  I intern (well-paying, but still part time), am in school, and have a mortgage/bills/etc.  At the end of the day, we can both afford the ticket.  This is about principle).

I talked with her today and money came up, then I revisited airfare and asked if she was still planning on paying half, and she said no (in more words-- ""I don't think it's a good idea.  This other girl is here and her boyfriend is coming to visit her and she's not paying"", etc.).

This is a bummer because to me, her willingness to pay half was a sign that she's willing to make sacrifice for the relationship, and it's not just me being walked on and supporting her.  I don't feel that she's making any sacrifice by having me here back home supporting her adventure.  This was the only thing I saw as proving her investment in the relationship.

Tl;dr:  Girlfriend wants to stick it out while she does Peace Corps in Africa 26months.  Before departing, committed to paying half of flying me out there.  One month in, reverses decision and doesn't feel like she should pay.

but im depressed. it seems like i have so much going for me, but i think that theres nothing else to experience. i have nothing to look forward to. im just gonna go to college, get my degree, and be a comp sci dude for the rest of my life. im not going to get a hot wife because im an engineer, im going to move into a city work a bunch of hours with a bunch of socially inept nerds and get paid a lot. im gonna work for 30 years and then retire and die. my wife is gonna have the time of her life; fucking off with all the money im making (same with my kids). its not going to be true love at all. i dont even know how girls work. ive tried multiple times, ive kissed a couple girls (my first kiss was at 18, how pathetic is that) but i always end up scaring them away or they lose interest in me. i dont know why. i have never kissed the same girl twice. i have no female friends.

so the past 3 days i havent been to work...... i just couldnt find the motivation to. my coworkers and friends have been texting me and messaging me, wanting to hang out, wondering where ive been, etc. but i honestly dont give a fuck anymore. i havent responded to any of them.

over the course of these 3 days ive been at home not talking to anyone ive noticed my dad. he has this sort of bipolar thing going on. sometimes hes totally happy and content with everything and other times hes completely down in the dumps. yesterday he passed out in the hallway, i was in my bed listening to music being depressed and stuff when i heard a thud, i went outside and i saw my dad just laying there on the floor in his underwear, i tried to get him up but he was too fat, i asked him does he need me to call an ambulance. he said ""dont, im gonna die soon anyway and all this shit will finally be over"". he ended up being fine after a few minutes and he walked around being delirious and i didnt call the cops.

i also told my dad i wanted to kill myself and he straight up started talking about how important i am to him and how it seems that i dont give a shit about him or anything and he started crying right there, i just sat there and did nothing, eventually he left and i started crying too. but i dont give a shit. i dont give a shit about anyone or anything including myself. i dont know where this is going at all. fuck my life

on a side note, the only reason i havent killed myself yet are for three reasons.

1. im going to a rave tomorrow with a coworker, maybe i might get some MDMA so i can finally experience happiness for the first time.

2. im also going to do LSD for the first time on saturday, i heard that treats depression

z4dkz,5,2012-08-31,Hi ladies - desperately need some life advice and comfort right now :( Sorry in advance for text wall.,dragon_daughter,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/z4dkz/hi_ladies_desperately_need_some_life_advice_and/,"**TL;DR Throwaway account, college girl yelled at by parents about playing video games with friends and needs to spend time away from home for at least a night. :( Feeling very lonely and upset right now.**

So I'm a pretty average young lady; I go to an Ivy League college, get decent grades, and in general, would like to think that I am a decent person. I don't drink regularly, smoke, do drugs, or anything. I am a pre-med student majoring in biology, and hope to go on to med school to become a doctor one day.

What I do do, though, is play video games. And that gets me into trouble with my parents (I would like to add that I am Asian). However, the issue isn't that I sit around for the entire day and do nothing but play video games, it's the fact that I play in the evenings with my friends. I almost never play single-player games; I play them for social reasons. In the daytime, I usually try to go out and meet up with friends. I also worked for 2 months during the summer away from home; I stayed with a relative because it was more convenient to get to my internship from their home. I did come home on the weekends, but on the weekdays I really had nothing to do at night except hang out at the house and play games with my friends (since none of my friends lived in that region). But whenever my parents see me playing a game, they out me on it and just continuously yell at me and tell me I'm wasting their tuition money even though it's the summer (?).

The last fight I had with my parents, they told me I wasn't a good daughter because I never did anything for them. I do like to think that I try to do what I am told in regards to academics; getting good grades, working hard in high school, trying to get into a decent college. However, I did realize I wasn't doing anything to improve my relationship with them specifically, so even though my dad yelled at me about it in a very negative way, I tried to change myself after my weekend vacation trip to visit a friend. I had my return bus time changed and paid the extra fee required so that I could be home earlier because my mom said she wanted me to come home earlier. When I got home, I tried to have more of a presence when they were home and not just see them during mealtimes (ie. going grocery shopping with dad, hanging around during dinnertime, etc). I have a lot of difficulty talking to my mom, and that's kind of why I try avoiding my parents; my mom is extraordinarily opinionated and it's hard to see any reason that's not her own.

Anyway, this is my last week of summer before going off to school, and I have tried to make an effort to see my friends during the day, spend time with my family, while still playing a few games at night. Today, my mom walked in and I was playing and she snapped at me again. I just don't know what to do anymore, my dad heard and came over and they both just tagteamed and yelled at me. Just saying I'm wasting my mother's money, I owe her 100k after college, I'm wasting my life, never doing anything productive, telling me I was comparable to an alcoholic/drug addict (in my honest opinion, it's not the same at all), and then finally, telling me that they didn't even think I was their daughter. They made me seem like the only thing in life I'm interested in right now is video games. Everyone will probably say, just stop playing until you get back to school, but the thing is, once I get back to school I know I won't be playing as much anymore unless I want to face the consequences. I enjoy playing the game with my friends, and I feel like such a hobby shouldn't face such serious reprimandings.

I felt that they were just being unreasonable about it since it is still the summer and I know once school starts I won't be playing as much anymore. I told them that, but they don't listen to me. And my mother just spouts such stupid nonsense sometimes that I get frustrated and can't deal with it anymore. I finally just yelled at my parents to get out of my room and told my dad to find a new daughter.

I can't deal with being at home right now, so I'm trying to find a friend to stay with for the night, although it's pretty late for me and most of my friends have already moved back to college. I know this will probably end badly for me, but I am so angry and frustrated by this that I am ready to make a drastic decision. This is not the first time it has happened. I am just so lost as to what I can do. I am a pretty stubborn person myself and I am just so unbelievably upset about this that I have considered entirely giving up.

Literally any words will help at this point. :( I'm about to pack up and sneak out of the house for the night.

Edit: Please feel free to ask questions about me if you would like, I will be as honest as I can."
z49dw,31,2012-08-30,Advice on being sued for an ER medical bill?,[deleted],Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/z49dw/advice_on_being_sued_for_an_er_medical_bill/,"Long story short, I went to the ER last July at the advice of a nurse coworker.  I have not had health insurance since being laid off in Dec of 2010 (working the whole time, but only part time, considered underemployed, but not eligible for UI until laid off from second pt job this past May).  I paid $25.00 at the time of service, and completed the paper work for discount/charity.  Bill is still $3,800.00  They literally just took blood and took an X-ray.  

Apparently, it was a gallbladder attack, first one ever.  The ER Dr. scolded me for using the ER for a ""non life-threatening"" issue.  I had called my Dr., couldn't get me in until 4 days later, and there are no UC clinics in the area I was in (at work).  The pain had me doubled over and unable to breathe regularly, so, I thought the ER was probably my best option at the time.  I did inform them that I have no medical insurance.

Also, after dxing the gallbladder, and confirming that I was not dying, I asked the Dr. if he could give me a painkiller so that I could return to work.  He said, and I quote, ""Ma'am, are you asking me for NARCOTICS?"".  *sigh*  I didn't want to miss more work, I can't afford to as it is.  He didn't provide me with any pain meds, or any options to get any from a pharmacy, and he refused to give me fluids even though the Intern stated that I was dehydrated and needed them (I often have dehydration due to an AI disorder).

So, I applied for the ""charity"", and got the bill for $3,800.00  I called the hospital and they refused to take anything less than $50 a month.  I am currently working 3 pt jobs, collecting UI (when my wages don't exceed the $176 a week I get), and using food stamps.  I cannot afford the $50 a month, but offered to pay $5 or $10 a month until I get back on my feet (which hopefully isn't too long from now).  They refused, sent it to collections.  Collections is telling me the same thing.

I went to court earlier this week re this issue, and the judge was immediately frustrated with me as I was asking questions bc I have never been to court before and I did not understand how the process worked.  He told me that we weren't there to ""negotiate"" and that he didn't have time to ""get involved"" bc there were people waiting.  ???  I don't know why I was in court really?  

So, Although financial help would be fantastic, I am willing to pay the bill, just slowly for now.  I can't really afford it, but I did use the ER.  I think that $3,800 is too high for a blood draw and an X-ray, and at the court, the cost was now around $8,000, but the judge wouldn't let me talk and when I asked why the price had gone up, he told me again that there were people waiting.  

Advice?  How do I handle this?  Is there any way I can get the collection agency to lower the amount to a more reasonable amount?  Or accept a payment under $50 a month (if they will even accept that now as they are suing me)?  

I'm working as much as possible, being honest with UI and turning in all my earnings.  I'm getting $86 a month in food stamps, and that's it.  None of my jobs are ft, so I'm not eligible for insurance, and independent insurances are too expensive on my $13,000 a year (down from the $45,000 a year I made pre layoff).  And even if I could afford them, they would NEVER cover my pre-existing, which includes my AI which is what causes me the most medical issues anyway.  I've barely kept my house, and still may lose it.  

Thanks in advance if you took the time to read this.  I've seen Reddit really come through for some folks on here, and I'm hoping that this may be one of those times, even if it's just someone being able to help me understand my options here.  

I'm near Kansas City, Missouri.

EDIT:  So, is the consensus that I should start sending in small payments now?  I got a continuance at court the other day, they gave me 3 weeks.  September 17, I go back.  Will it do any good?  (I'm kicking myself for not just sending the small payments prior to now, and for listening to them that if I couldn't send the $50 a month not to bother!)"
z42gz,0,2012-08-30,Eighteen years old. Have great potential. Talented in the computer field. Doesn't matter to me. I am planning on dropping out of school and pursuing eSports. I invite you to watch me while I stream my journey.,[deleted],leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/z42gz/eighteen_years_old_have_great_potential_talented/,"So first off my name is Austin. I live in Arkansas, and have been playing LoL since open beta. I grew up in a household where gaming was a staple activity. We didn't go outside and throw the football. We didn't take many vacations. Most of our time was spent inside playing MMOs, RTSs, RPGs as a family. Growing up in a very computer oriented environment I developed a skill in computers, ranging from hardware to software I tend to think I can do it all. I currently work for a Fortune 500 company as a intern.  Still that might not mean anything to you guys, just thought I would throw it out there. I am going into my second week of college and I am starting to realize this isn't for me. I am , plain and simple, unhappy. So what is the most reasonable thing to do? Drop out of college and pursue a career in eSports. I am completely aware I have a bigger chance of failing at this than I do succeeding. At least I will have fu n and be happy if I fail right..... right? Anyways if you would like to watch me play I am going to be streaming my entire journey. Love to chat it up with you all and I looking forward to ANY response to this. 

TL;DR Quit college getting a dinky job to live off of. Gonna try to get into eSports. Watch me if you would like.
