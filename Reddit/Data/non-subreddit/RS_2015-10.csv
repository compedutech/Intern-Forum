SUMMER ENDS MUSIC FESTIVAL


* 10:15AM - Hop in Uber to Bus Stop
* 10:30AM - Hop on Bus from Tucson to Tempe
* 12:10AM - Arrive in Phoenix
* 12:40PM - We arrive in line outside Tempe Beach Park

 
We roll up thinking we would be first in line...NO this line was already starting to wrap around the street. We were planning on being front row all day. There is 5 of us, 3 of my friends go to get food for us while me and my other buddy are holding down the fort in line probably 200 people back. Some guys up front say they've been there since 6:30AM It's hot as fuck like 105 degrees standing in this line. Me and Friend A keep switching off turns standing in front of this mister (water sprayer) down the street while the other one would wait in line. Eventually my homie noticed there is a gate for the vendors that is super easy to sneak through. We end up scouting this little entrance for a good hour or so until our friends get back w/ the food. Friends B C and D finally get back with some shitty overpriced pizza. Me and Friend A have decided that closer to when the gates open (2:30pm) we will sneak through the vendor gate (we want front row!). We pass the idea on to the rest of our friends and they bitch out. 

 
So me and Friend A get our pizza and want to go sit down while the other guys take their shift of holding the line. We are walking towards the shade to sit and eat this pizza and the opportunity was golden. I tell my homie to go for it and he nudges the gate and slips right through pizza box in hand. I'm low-key stunned that this dude actually just snuck into this festival. I quickly follow but am stopped by a security guard asking if we are bartenders. I look at the gate, look back at here, don't say anything and just walk through. Me and Friend A have made it! We have snuck in, we are going to get front row! We're walking down the vendor entrance and the security keeps yelling at us, ""Hey!"" ""You two!"" ""Come back!"" we act like we can't hear and keep walking. Till we find port-a-potties. We go to the safehouse (port-a-potties) and sit in there for like 10 minutes. It's so fucking hot in there they're like little greenhouses with the Arizona sun. Eventually we walk out and sit at a table to enjoy our pizza. There is about 45 min till gates open at this point. Everyone within the gates is getting set up, preparing for the night ahead. Time goes on and about 5 minutes before the gates open we go and post up [front row - center stage](http://imgur.com/ch8cMpP). Right on the other side of the gate there's this little ledge to step on and I tell my friends Travis is gonna come RIGHT here. Keep in mind this is a super shitty venue and I have no clue who decided it'd be a good idea to throw a 4 day music festival here. The two stages are literally right next to each other. So despite Kaytranda, Vic Mensa, and Chance the Rapper having their sets on the other stage. We were still able to see and hear them because of how close the stages were set up (Friends A,B,C, and D are all up here now). 


At 5:30 Pusha came on and his set was alright.. Then after Chance's set on the West stage the Rodeo had began to get set up. Chase B (Travis Scott's DJ) came out and did a little set to get the crowd in the mood. The Rodeo was starting... I was front row pressed up against the gate and kids were flying over our heads whether they were, too drunk, too hot, claustrophobic, etc. There were SO many kids we had to help over just prior to Trav's set. The night before 12 kids were seriously injured from being front row and being pressed up against the gate so hard. I am holding a sign that reads, ""TRAV, I survived the Rodeo let me stage dive"" (the stage was too far back anyway) on one side and on the other ""KANYE, let me intern for DONDA."" I was also wearing Mike Deans M.W.A hat which he gave to me when I was front row after Kanye's 2014 Outside Lands set. 

 
So anyways, the Rodeo starts and **it's lit.** Holy fuck. I went to his Rodeo tour with Young Thug a few months back and it's that intense but 10x more people. I'm holdin up the sign and shit throughout his set and I'm giggin having a great time rapping all the lyrics, making eye contact w/ trav blah blah blah. Eventually Travis plays ""Drugs You Should Try It"" my favorite song by him and one of my favorite songs of all time. The sonics are just so fucking good! Sure enough he notices me super into the song and hops off stage on comes down [RIGHT WHERE](http://imgur.com/uV9IR5j) I told my friends he would come. This dude Travis and I are straight gettin into it. I was lookin La Flame ~~in the eye,~~ in the soul bro. Check out the video [HERE](https://twitter.com/seangarschi/status/648396349898002433) This was an awesome experience. The show was awesome. None of my 4 other friends survived the Rodeo they all got carried over the gate lmaooo. Best of all, right when that finished. Kanye was next. Oh, and I ended up touching Kanye after his set. I'm super fascinated with these guys, their visions, their worlds, and their work. I hope one day to work alongside Kanye or Travis.

 
Let me know what you guys think of this piece and my writing. I am going to be starting a hip-hop/pop culture website blog sort of thing so any constructive criticism is appreciated.

p.s. I don't have an album with a bunch of pics or anything cause I don't believe in having your phone out during concerts. Those pics and videos are my friends. (expect the [""Piss On Your Grave"" video](https://vine.co/v/eQXU0WUOmj2) I commented is mine)

3n2bu2,7,2015-10-01,"(X-post from /r/relationships) I (21F) think I need to cut my family off permanently (42M, 42F, 24F) after everything they've done.",Badkidaplenty,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3n2bu2/xpost_from_rrelationships_i_21f_think_i_need_to/,"This is going to be a very long post as I have a lot of reasons as to why I want to cut off my parents and my sister. Mom 42F, Sister 24F, Dad 42M, Niece, 3F, SO 22M (6 months together)

It all started when I was a kid. My sister was a notorious liar and therefore got all the attention from my parents. I rarely got any attention and when I would do bad things, I still wouldn't get any. My sister kept my parents busy.
Middle school comes around and my sister kept getting in trouble. But this time, she would take me down with her. She would date people my parents didn't approve of and I would get grounded for knowing. She would lie and I would get in trouble for not telling on her. However, when I would tell on her, my parents would say how I was jealous of her and how I needed to not be a tattle tale.

High school was the worst. My sister graduated and everything she needed; she got. Someone else paid for her graduation party, cap and gown, college deposit, moved her to college, etc. My parents would go down for a two hour drive to visit her and would take her food. At home, it was still all about her. My mom would call and talk to her and then only talk to me about her.

I was an A student in high school. I won awards and went to writing conferences and received medals. They complained if they had to go with me anywhere. I didn't get approval or even a good job. I graduated with two diplomas and I didn't hear a single thing from either of my parents about it.

My senior year my sister came home pregnant. All of the sudden I had a curfew. Of 8 at night. I was 18 years old. Everything became about her and the baby and everyone forgot that it was supposed to be my year.
I paid for my cap and gown. My CNA test and CPR test and any supplies. I paid for my graduation party and venue. I paid for my college deposit, for my college education, and for my braces. My parents did not help me move in or out. They did not visit me.

I had been hired for an internship in New York and they refused to let me leave. They told me that it was a worthless decision and that it was stupid for me to go. They guilted me into not going.
I was suicidal in college and all they cared about was that I wanted to leave them without me. My mom specifically said that I shouldn't do it for her. I told them so that I could get help, not a guilt trip.
My sister graduated and no one cared that I opened my own nonprofit. Every time I try to talk to them about it, they said they don't understand so they don't care. i give out scholarships and apparently that's too hard to understand.

I spent this past summer with them and I went to work and I did online classes. My dad screamed at me all the time that I was lazy because I didn't want to get up and help clean up after my sister and my niece. I was taking online tests and he would shut off the internet. Then yell at me some more. I decided I would spend as little time there as possible.

I decided to get an apartment and they all encouraged me living with my boyfriend (22M) and I liked the idea. We signed a lease and that very night my mom and dad sat us down to tell us how stupid we are. How we are going to fall on our faces. They said that I am a bad daughter. Later that night my dad screamed at me that he was glad that I was leaving because I made the entire family miserable.

I apparently made the family miserable because I did not want to spend time with them getting yelled at all summer.( I did not spend time with my niece (3F) as much as I would have liked to because my sister said that she didn't trust me going down the street with her.. even though when she wanted to go out and such I babysat for her. I did everything right. So the mistrust was very wrongly placed.) My sister then agree that I made her miserable too and that I needed to go.

They also said that because I didn't contribute financially that I needed to leave. They wanted money for cigarettes, fast food, two entire bills. I was almost never there. Why should I be paying $300 to live there when I need to save money for college?

On my 21st we moved in. I transferred schools. We fight a lot because we are stressed out. But we are also happy. My parents have not made an effort to come see our place. They complain that I don't see them but never contribute for gas. When I do get there, they make fun of my boyfriend and ask us for money. They ask him for cigarettes. They want us to buy them fast food.

We got a dog after much consideration and we love this puppy. We were told by my dad to only spend money if necessary. Why would I work for all of this money and only pay bills? I wanted a dog for when I am home alone. So that we can be a family unit. My mom told me that I should return my puppy because I am not responsible enough for a dog.... When I took care of the family dog since I was seven and I had to pay for him to be put down when it was his time to go.

Recently, I bought my first car. I was never allowed to use their car for my driving test, unlike my sister, so I still don't have a license. I went with my SO's parents to look at this car before and after it had some repairs done. I was extremely excited that I would no longer need a ride everywhere. I called my sister and because I didn't know exactly what had been wrong with it she started yelling at me and hung up.
Later I called my mom to tell her my excellent news and she told me that I was making stupid decisions and that it was an irresponsible buy and that I hurt my dad's feelings. She said I should have had him come out to look at it, but he won't even come half way to the dealer which is where i live. She told me I am making bad decisions with my life and that I don't deserve a car or a license. She said that I wouldn't like it if she stopped worrying or caring about me, a threat she uses all the time. But then she said that I shouldn't call anymore.

OK.

So then she messaged me on facebook asking me to put out over $180 for a carseat for my niece. I never responded because I didn't want to talk to her anymore either. She then tried to guilt me and said that she would figure it out herself. Never mind letting my sister buy it for her daughter. She then had my sister call me relentlessly until I answered and she was asking if I would buy it. I said no. She then said she had to go and hung up.

My mom then says this:
You know the silent treatment isnt called for. Of course im glad you arent at (MY SO's) mercy and dont have to wait alone in a darkempty parking lot. But im still mom and gonna worry you got taken. If that pisses you off to the point that youre done talking to me, just remember his fucking parents dont even care for him so why would they you? Im about done trying (my name) ill only take so much punishment for what you think i do wrong.
I never responded. I was trying to figure out in my head how this could possibly be my fault. Then yesterday I messaged my sister asking her to bring my niece over so that I could see her. She said that I only contact them when I need them and that I never bought her a carseat, so no.

Another thing about my family is that my mom told my SO that he has to go to HER holidays and that if he doesn't that he isn't allowed back over. My dad I recently learned was doing meth. Everyone is hiding it from me. My mom has surgery last month on my one day off and they all guilted me into going saying that there was a chance she would die. Instead she yelled at me when she got out.
What do I do? Do I just cut them out of my life and sacrifice my niece in the process? She's the only reason I have been putting up with them...

TLDR: My family is insane and disowned me but still wants me to do things for them."
3n2fux,9,2015-10-01,Me [24 F] with my parents [50s M/F] constantly pressuring me to get a second job or find a job that generates more income.,family_throwaway1227,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3n2fux/me_24_f_with_my_parents_50s_mf_constantly/,"Hi Reddit!

I feel that I'm a bit in a pickle. I'm the first girl in my immediate family to get a bachelor's degree. And the only one to get a degree in engineering (electrical). My parents are immigrants to this country (dad is from the Middle East and mom is from Latin America). Both their cultures are different from each other but still very strict. We are not very well off so my parents have always regarded money as very precious and it was always on the forefront of every conversation growing up. We were not allowed to ask for things that ""spoiled white kids"" had because it would make us broke, etc. My parents have always been very critical of my brother and I. Especially me because I'm a girl (both cultures are pretty sexist too). When I went to school, my parents always pressured me about money. I paid for 95% of school through scholarships, grants and engineering internships I worked at throughout my time there. 

When it came time to graduate, I moved back home and found a job in a month.  They kept screaming at me that money was tight and throwing in my face that they sacrificed a lot for me to go to a 4 year university. They aren't completely wrong. I know forking over a few grand isn't easy and no one is holding a gun to their heads, forcing them to. I was sick of them holding this over my head so I paid back every cent. They kept finding new things to control over me so I packed up and moved out on my own. 

I live in Southern CA. The cost of living is horrible here. But I wanted to be independent as possible so I budgeted my money to live in a small studio in a not so affluent neighborhood. But I LOVE it. I don't have a lot of things so my studio is the right size for me. And I reach my savings goals every month. But every time I visit home, my parents try to slip to me that my income is too measly for someone ""as smart as you."" I make about $50k. I am aware that's not much for CA living but it puts a roof over my head and food on the table easily. But they keep saying it's beneath me to make under $60k and that my job is dumb. 

But I love my job. It's not as technical as some but I like the sales/customer service aspects to it. I think if I was told to sit at a cubicle all day developing or testing, I'd die. My customers are wonderful and they make me laugh. And I get to be an engineer and help them with all the technical aspects of our product as well. It's a win win for me. But my company is small and I'm entry level. It would take some time for me to make more than a certain amount because a lot of the people there have been with the company for more than 15-20 years. The avg. tenure there is 11 years. But I still like it. Just because it's not Boeing or JPL, doesn't mean it's crappy. I've also taken up volunteering in my community to help low income high school kids of immigrants (like I was) get into college. My mom FREAKED out about this. I hate to stereotype, but I'm not sure what it is about Latinos and volunteering. Every Hispanic person I've talked to about it looks down on me like I'm crazy. My mom keep screaming, ""why do free work if you can get paid as a tutor anyway?!"" It's not about money to me. It's about helping kids who have no means to pay for it.

I'm not sure how to kindly tell my folks to fuck off. I've tried to be gentle but every time I bring it up, they get so angry. They say they just want what's best for me and to push me to be more ambitious. But I feel like I am ambitious. I have a full time job that's turning into a fulfilling career, I'm the first to graduate from college in my poor, immigrant family and I pay for all my bills. No one else provides for me in any way right now. It's all me and my ""measly pennies."" I tried to calmly tell my folks that I am very happy where I am at and that I feel pressured and they called me disrespectful and defensive. And that I don't ""honor my mother and father"" and I shouldn't go to church because I'm a hypocrite in this way (I am very involved in my alma mater's church community as I still live near the area). I have regrettably snapped at them at times and they just get even angrier. I don't want to cut off contact but I'm tired of feeling like I'm never good enough. My therapist has been helping me cope but it's still difficult. Any advice? Have any of you gone through something similar?
   
**tl;dr**: My strict, foreign parents think my job is beneath me. They have resorted to passive aggressively telling me to get a 2nd job or a better one and get angry when I firmly tell them I like where I am. I know their cultures are very strict and it's a different dynamic than others but I'm tired of always feeling inadequate. Has anyone gone through something similar?"

3n2xew,6,2015-10-01,(IT) Is it reasonable expecting a bump in my salary?,Dueperdue,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3n2xew/it_is_it_reasonable_expecting_a_bump_in_my_salary/,"Hello all. First time poster here, please hang on with me.

I am a 21 (soon-to-be 22) years old network engineer. When I finished high school I went and did a networking course that Cisco held. After my first certification I fell in love with the field, and got myself a **CCNP** in little time.

Through my course I had the chance of being introduced to various companies looking for people in the field. I have been taken by a big multinational which has establishments in many countries (one of which in Italy).

I don't think I spent 1 month in the company because they immediately ""sold me out"" as a consultant for another company, much bigger than mine. This company has a presence in dozens of other countries and they use a common datacenter infrastructure which spans 4 countries.

I have been a consultant for this company 1.5 years now. Despite my age, I am in a position where I am the one making decisions on what to do in the datacenter (for how irresponsible might that be on the client's part - or I guess I proved I am capable?) .

Either way, when I got hired this gig was expected to last 3-6 months. I take 1.5-2 hours to arrive to the client's place (public transportation) and the same to get home. I didn't mind, since it was supposed to ""not last""... besides, I was an intern at the time, so what the hell, ""let's do this"".

My company hired me for 1 year. Due to the great job I was doing my contract got extended  to ""indeterminate"" after my year ended. A few years back in Italy this type of contract basically meant it was almost impossible for you to get fired. Last/this year they passed a law which basically makes this contract a lot less robust than it was.


**I currently make 22K € a year**, around 16-17K without taxes. When my manager got me in his office to tell me ""the big news"", he told me they hired me indefinitely and that in the next days HR will get in touch about the contract.

When they did, they basically made me sign the exact same contract I have signed previously, with only 1 word changed: from *determinate* to *indeterminate* under the ""contract type"". That was it. No company car (my manager knows about how much I travel), no kind of raise, no nothing. They even made my ""job position"" to be our client's building, so I couldn't request money for travel expenses (bus/subway).

I was pissed. When my manager called me in his office to wrap things up he said that ""now I am officially part of the team"" and asked me ""how I feel"". With all the *politically correctness* I had in me i told him that while I was thrilled for the job contract, I was expecting something more. 

He then said that ""It's the first time we offer this type of contract to someone so young (I was 20 at the time), the company is betting on you"". I then explained to him how this is a moot point, since with the new law this type of contract changed to it's core and does not have anymore the same benefits (aka, they can now lay you off when basically they want).

A few days later we have another meeting. He said that he spoke with HR and that he confirms that indeed the law has changed. *""But this remains as a good indicator""* he tells me, *""of the company willing to invest in you""*. I then tell him how the client (with whom I have become somewhat close/frank) told me that they pay **80K €** for me, for 11 months. The client also joked at the time about how *""I can get a raise now""*. 

My manager said that indeed *"" the company margins are high ""* but that *""I shouldn't see it this way""*, that if tomorrow they send me to a client who pays less, my salary won't be affected. I will always have the *guarantee* to earn at least that amount, no matter how much they ""sell me"" at.

He then proceeded in telling me that even if he was considering giving me some kind of raise, there are ""many candidates"" and that ""he can point only one out"". Furthermore, he added, raises are given in Jan-Feb, not now (we had this conversation a few months back).

About the ""car"" matter, he told me that now that I know I have the job ""indefinitely"", I can plan on **buying one**. I told him that I can't afford a car and that I would really like to leave my parent's house (it doesn't run good blood), but I couldn't, since 1250 € a month doesn't allow me to live on my own.

He ended saying that he can't justify giving me a company car, and that the situation will change if I were to need to travel to various clients (apparently 4 hours every day on public transportation does not *qualify*).

Today my client told me that in the next months I would be occupying an even more demanding position, because my current boss (the client) will be on a leave for several months and I will be taking her place.

While I like the job and I feel honored, I am simply too frustrated at the moment. The stress is really getting to me as it is and losing 4 hours a day going and coming back from work is killing me. I don't know if I can do this for another year plus the additional stress from the new role.

What should I be doing? Is it reasonable for me to expect to be paid more or to get a car-company at least to ease my way to work? Am I demanding too much too soon? What are my options?

With an unemployment rate of 40% among the young, I initially thought I hit the jackpot... but now, I am wondering which would be worse.

Thanks for reading.

3n4001,0,2015-10-01,Considering switching my Major,Spr0_The_GOAT,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/3n4001/considering_switching_my_major/,"I am currently an Accounting major. I really do enjoy Accounting, even doing the homework, however I am considering switching over to Finance for the following reasons:

I will have 90 credits after this semester and in order to graduate with a Bachelors in Accounting I will need 150 credits. However, I only need 120 credits for a bachelors in Finance. I want to switch because with a Finance degree I can graduate in 2 more semesters as opposed to 4, saving about 25-30k. 

Another reason I am thinking about switching is because I had an internship doing mortgages and all the employees work off commission giving them the opportunity to make more money based on how well they do. I personally think I need this type of pay structure to be motivated to do my best.

My issue is though I love accounting it seems that accounting jobs max out at about 82k a year (unless you have a masters) with no way to make commission. Many people tell me Accountants usually hate their life because their job is so boring. Moreover many of the people at the mortgage brokerage I worked at had degrees in areas that weren't finance (marketing, psychology, etc) leading me to believe that getting a degree is more important than what your degree is actually in when it comes to finding a job.

Is their a reason I would be better off financially or in any other aspect if I stay in Accounting as opposed to Finance?"
3n43vy,11,2015-10-01,My Productivity Machine to take 18 hours while holding down a job (and not suck at everything),pig_swigger,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/3n43vy/my_productivity_machine_to_take_18_hours_while/,"**Intro – Who the hell am I?**

First off, I’m not promoting my dumb blog, not looking for advertising clicks, or looking to gain anything of any kind from this post. I’m just a 3L with a mediocre GPA, and I’m facing a daunting semester and gained a lot of tools preparing for it that are working for me and that I want to share.

This will hopefully be the post I was wishing existed a few months ago, but couldn't find. It’s long. There's maybe more background than most of you will be interested in, and it will be longer than some of you want to read, but I bet someone looking at this post for help will identify with it. I’m an amateur at this. I’ve read several books, listened to a bunch of podcasts, and spent over a thousand dollars on professional coaching over the last few months, which means what I write may be confusing and assume a lot and skip over things. But I am 100% sure that I can help a fellow law student who is crazy stressed out live a better life with the tools I’ve gained. If you’re confused, ask questions and I’ll do everything I can to answer or find an answer. 

**My Story of Being Miserable**

Because I worked about 35 hours a week for my whole 2L year, I took 12-hour semesters to keep things manageable. I intended to catch some up over the summer, but ended up only being able to take 2 hours because of my schedule. Consequently, I was left with 31 hours to take care of over my 3L year. I didn't want to leave myself a huge pile for the last semester in case something went horribly wrong, so that meant taking 18 this fall.

so my first step, you might guess, was to panic. I'd never been much of a student. I did the minimum to get by and it was obvious from my grades and class standing. Ultimately I knew that grades and standing don't matter much in the grand scheme, but what I realized is that, more than wanting to really do well, I wanted to do as well as I *could*, with little to no stress. 

My chief strategy up to this point had been rigorous procrastination briefly punctuated by panicked thrashing around when deadlines came. I was always worried about what was coming but never taking action, which lead to a lot of negative emotional consequences and an overarching belief that I didn't really belong in law school, would never really succeed, and was wasting three years of my life and tens of thousands of dollars. I carried the weight of that around all the time, which in turned killed my motivation to work, resulting in greater procrastination, and throwing me farther down the rabbit hole. The panic at exam time would result in less sleep, no exercise, and terrible eating, which made me feel physically worse, which meant my work suffered even more. It finally dawned on me that these problems started *months*—not days, or even weeks—before.

I read a lot of blogs about tips and tricks for productivity, but I realized that these were for people who were not currently failing at most everything. I didn't need tips and tricks yet, or even really good tools. I needed a whole change in mindset. 

My friend had mentioned a book a few weeks before my moment of panic called [What's Best Next](http://www.amazon.com/Whats-Best-Next-Gospel-Transforms/dp/0310494222) by Matt Perman. Now stick with me for a minute. This book has a productivity approach that is openly rooted in Christian theology, the thesis of which being that the Christian calling is to maximize all the good they can for everyone they possibly can, as often as they can, in every sphere of life. If Christianity isn't your particular brand of vodka, that's fine. But what Perman does before the nuts-and-bolts of a productivity system is what all the productivity people I listen to suggest: finding your *why*. His practical application is a synthesis largely of David Allen's *Getting Things Done* (GTD) which I recommend to the moon and back, and some of Steven Covey's work, which I know next to nothing about. 

I read Perman's book first, and after laying out the Christian ideas behind finding a ""why"", he does more or less a distillation and his version of the GTD system, which gave me a bit of context to read the book itself and flesh out a lot of the ideas. You probably have a lot of reading to do already. I recommend Allen's book and think it's vitally important, but it isn't hard to find summaries like Perman's that will get you started in the right direction if you don't want to read the whole book right this second. Here's one I enjoyed: [GTD in 15 Minutes](https://hamberg.no/gtd/). One insight I'll offer here that really clicked things for me after 2-3 months of getting into this stuff is that the GTD system at the end of the day is not really about getting more things done - it's about getting all the noise of your life out of your head and into a system that you trust so you can bring all of your energy to the work that you need to do, unimpeded and free from distraction. 

This aspect of GTD, the capturing of every thing bouncing around in my head and corralling it into a system I trust, has been one of the best things that's ever happened to me in my life. I literally have experienced essentially zero stress as it relates to school/work/daily life task management for almost half a year. My relationship with my wife is better (because now if she asks me to do something she's no longer adding on to some colossal stack of whatever is weighing down on my mind). Our house works better, our bills are never late, there is always a backup bottle of Sriracha in time, we never run out of toilet paper, our passports were updated weeks ahead of schedule for a big trip, and whatever else you can think of. 

Not only are the things themselves taken care of, *but the stress of knowing important things aren't done, is gone*. I'm not saying there isn't stress in my life, or that nothing worries me and everything is perfect. But the things that I can control are either under my control or subject to a plan of attack that will get them there. And the resulting cognitive space lets me respond appropriately to those stressors that arrive unexpectedly. 

We can get into a discussion about GTD methodology and similar practices if people are interested, but I think since this post is already long, I want to talk about the four areas where I've seen the most progress and resultant elimination of stress from even the crazy-busy semester I have: getting stuff out of my head, scheduling, overcoming procrastination, and timeblocking.

My goal for this semester was to have a plan of attack from the very beginning that would result in gradually mastering the material I was learning over the full semester, so that the 6 exams I have (and the weeks before them) would be stress-free. 

***Method***

**Step 1 – Getting it out of your head**

The GTD system is build on the simple idea that your brain is meant for having ideas, and not holding them. To truly become a GTD practitioner, David Allen recommends sitting down when you have at least 2 hours to get every open loop (buy dog food, fill out fafsa, write research memo, fill out exam conflict form, beer brewing, figure out 401(k) go to bank, learn to cook bbq, pay cell phone bill, buy girlfriend’s birthday present (alternatively, get girlfriend)) out of your head and into some system that you then review regularly, usually once a week. You can do this to paper, but I can’t help you there, because I never tried it,  and I wanted to carry around my life in an app, so if I lose my computer and phone in the same day, I can go to a school computer and it’s all still there. There are some fantastic free task managers out there (though I don’t have direct experience with them), like Asana, Todoist and Wunderlist. I use Omnifocus, which I highly recommend primarily for the reason that it is super customizable and can *hide* a lot of the stuff not relevant for the moment. It’s expensive. And I spent another $50 on coaching to learn how to really get the most out of it and I think it is phenomenally worth it – but I digress. If you don’t want to do this for your whole life right now (even though it will eliminate a significant amount of stress from your life), at least do it for everything involving school. Reading assignments, due dates/deadlines for bar exam/MPRE/bar prep, papers, exams, etc. Everything relevant to your experience as a student.

I recommend doing this in a task manager or excel spreadsheet or whatever, and not your calendar, because if it’s all in your calendar, it’s a mess to look at and makes something like iCal extremely hard to use – and if it’s hard to use, you’re less likely to use it and trust it, and all the stuff you’ve gotten out of your head will slowly creep back in. In my opinion, your calendar is for bigtime deadlines, crucial appointments, and your schedule, which I’ll get to later. 

This may take some time, because there’s a lot of information in your syllabi to copy down, and you’ll want to be meticulous with the detail so, again, you’ll actually trust it and actually use it. I keep all my syllabi in evernote (another life-altering app which keeps my life almost entirely paperless) just in case. But after this process, you can essentially ditch your syllabi and work purely from your lists. When you get everything written down or typed in, you reference these lists and pull what needs to be worked on into a next-action list, which then determines your day. 

To maintain this, as you progress throughout the semester and any new task or appointment or anything that will take up headspace gets captured (whether typed in or written down) immediately. You will be amazed at how the thing you just wrote down, instead of weighing on you like normal, disappears from your head completely. You will likely complete forget what it was. And that’s the most beautiful goddamn thing you can experience. You can use an app on your phone, a moleskine, or even a [Hipster PDA]( http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/03/introducing-the-hipster-pda), and at the end of every day, just make sure what you’ve captured makes it into your system.

**Step 2 – Scheduling**

This was one of the most daunting parts about this semester – how I would even know when to do what I needed to do. I also realized that there would be a learning curve since I’d never approached anything in my life in as disciplined a fashion as this needed.

The first step was to get my must-do schedule on there. That meant class schedule, work, and routine home events that were all firm commitments. The second was to actually schedule the time I would be working outside of class, a large part of which is reading, so that I wouldn’t have to actually think about it or make decisions. All that would be necessary is sitting down with my phone or computer handy to know what was next. 

I also knew from past experience that simple reading was not enough to do well in a class. Reading, for me, is largely an ass-covering exercise for when I get cold called in class. Any way I can minimize reading in exchange for higher-leverage work, I do so. I also scheduled an extremely non-revolutionary concept called “deep work” that I got from from [Cal Newport]( http://calnewport.com). These are periods where I actually *engage* with material. Flash cards (studyblue.com lets you make them online which is way faster than by hand, for free, and has a free mobile app so you always have all of them with you for the 30 minutes between classes you would normally spend on Reddit), outlining, CALI lessons, reading examples and explanations, taking turns explaining stuff out loud with someone else in the class, whatever. Anything that stretches your brain and makes you really grapple with the material instead of just reading it or reading your notes. 

For each class, what I do in deep work will differ based on what kind of materials I’m allowed to bring to the exam. If it’s closed book, I do mainly flashcard work and maybe some outlining that I’ll condense later. If it’s open-book, I make sure to mark my books for reference if they have relevant statutes, outlining, and making condensed rule cheat-sheets. I’ve also tried mindmapping, etc. This is probably a lot of personal preference.

[Here is an example]( https://www.flickr.com/photos/135852596@N02/21810483622/in/album-72157658853253459/) of the schedule I pieced together over the first 2 weeks of school that is now working for me.  And the rule I’m currently working on is HONOR THY CALENDAR. Takes practice, incentive, and accountability, but I’m getting better at it. I work mainly in time-blocking rather than being task-specific, which I’ll explain below. 

I learned that doing this helped me be crystal clear about what I needed to be doing and when. For example, it’s not on this particular week in the link, but I have one class that almost every week has a 3-4 page paper due Friday at 5 P.M. On Thursdays, I have a lot of class and am usually mentally shot by the time I get home, and Wednesday is spent reading for Thursday classes during the day and often has social commitments at night, so I figured out that I need to schedule the time to write that paper *Tuesday night* in order to not turn it in late or be miserable working on it. Again, this took trial and error, but I now consequently don’t miss anything and I’m always a day ahead of what’s required of me. 

**Step 3 – Overcoming Procrastination**

I did a lot of reading about procrastination, and learned that there are a lot of reasons we do it. Sometimes a task is too overwhelming, sometimes it’s too hard, sometimes it’s just ambiguous. There are several helpful strategies here. 

**3.1** *Break it Down*

For large, overwhelming, and/or ambiguous tasks (like writing a brief or seminar paper, or doing an outline), I found that the hardest part was just getting started. A to-do item that says “write seminar paper” is useless. The list needs to be broken down into much smaller chunks that are actually actionable (which means the sentence is an action like “read Smith v. Garrison” instead of “table of contents” or editing), and ideally, the first one will only take a few minutes so you can get the ball rolling. A list like 

* make title page
* make list of westlaw research keywords 
* put in all memo section names
* sketch timeline of facts
* outline argument
* read [case 1] that prof. provided
* put on-point headnotes from [case 1] into relevant argument section
* do 1st full edit 3 days out
* do 2nd full edit day before due

and similar lists are far less likely to leave you mentally paralyzed and consequently ordering a pizza so you can start your third Breaking Bad binge. Make each task as small as you can. It feels good to check things off at a faster rate, and will make the project seem like something far easier to conquer. Because it will be.

**3.2** *Solar Flaring*

This is my magic bullet for when I just don’t want to do anything. The name for this is kind of dumb, but it comes from the amazing guys at Asian Efficiency who you should be reading and listening to their podcasts. The metaphor is that a solar flare is a small burst of explosions on the Sun that turn into massive astronomical phenomena affecting a planet 93 million miles away. The idea is that you commit to one very small task and promise yourself you’ll only do it for five minutes. When you’re dreading your work, you can talk yourself into doing just about anything for just five minutes. You trick yourself into work mode from lazy mode, and really develop some momentum. This is unbelievably simple, and works every time. 

**3.3** *Pomodoros*

This is a similar concept to solar flaring but on a larger scale. The concept is from an Italian scientist (pomodoro means “tomato” in Italian) who discovered blah blah all you need to know is it works according to SCIENCE. The idea is that when you set down to work, you set a timer for 25 minutes (there are a billion apps, most free, some paid with different bells and whistles) and take a 5 minute break, and then work for 25 minutes, and so on and so forth. After 4 pomodoros, take a 15-30 minute break. This will improve your focus and mental stamina by giving your brain a chance to rest so it can come back to the task at hand with fresh focus. You’ll also extend your useful work time by giving yourself constant breaks, so you’ll get 2 or 3 great hours instead of an hour sprint and being done. 

YOU MUST RESPECT THE TOMATO. For those 25 minutes, you only work on the task in front of you. If you must (and I must), use an app like Self-Control or WasteNoTime that can block distracting websites for certain amounts of time that you choose. WasteNoTime has an “instant lockdown” feature that blocks everything except websites you specify, so you can let it access westlaw, nexis, legal dictionary, CALI, etc, but nothing else that would distract you. 

You will have trouble RESPECTING THE TOMATO at first. It’s a muscle in your mind you’ll have to build up. But for me, after a few months, when I start that 25 minute timer, my response is almost Pavlovian and I zero in on what’s in front of me. I also have certain playlists through spotify’s focus genre that I only listen to during my pomodoros which further cue my brain into focus-mode. This is powerful stuff, and probably the best single piece of productivity advice anyone could implement. 

SET THE TOMATO. RESPECT THE TOMATO. 

**Step 4 – Timeblocking**

This is a complement to pomodoros. The idea being that you focus on nothing but one project or subject for a certain amount of time (chopping up that time into pomodoros). Especially for large-scale projects like seminar papers or law review articles that you can’t do in one sitting, this is a good way to make progress and not procrastinate without setting huge expectations you might not be able to meet. The orange blocks in the schedule I linked above is how I do my time blocking. I’m still ironing out the kinks by tracking my time and after another couple weeks will compare actual time spent to what’s scheduled so I can reallocate as necessary. 

The only other real thing I can think of to say is that I used to believe that I needed to read as close to class time as possible, but have found that when I give myself enough of a block of time to really engage with material, I’m generally always prepared for class while also gaining an understanding of the material. 

One further thing under time-blocking that has taken me to the next level of self-understanding was tracking my time. I made a spreadsheet in excel for my summer internship to track my hours for billing purposes. I got tired of math, so I made a column for start time, and a column for end time, and a column that added up the total time spent and translated into tenths of an hour. Here’s the [template]( https://www.dropbox.com/s/d894yxiewxilh4i/time%20sheet%20template.xlsx?dl=0) if anyone’s interested. What this did was eliminate a lot of the bullshit I told myself about how busy I was, because it would show me real numbers of the work I actually did. “That bar prep felt like 4 hours!” Well, actually it was only two and a half, which included at least half an hour of breaks. This makes it a lot harder to bullshit yourself, and has the added benefit of letting you adjust your schedule to the time tasks actually take over time. At first this semester I tracked *everything*, even wasted time. But that got too tedious and so now I only track what I do for school so I can pull the data into graphs and figure out where adjustments might need to be made. But hey, do what you want. 


**The Ending Part**

So the basic workflow that I wish I would have had someone tell me is fairly simple. 

1. Get everything out of your head and into a trusted system that you review regularly. Put those items into an actionable form. (read a, review b, write c)
2. Organize those actions and break large projects down into smaller, approachable, bite-size chunks
3. Block out your time between reading/surface level work and deep, interactive work, and focus on one thing at a time 
4. If you just can’t get started, promise yourself you’ll only work for 5 minutes and then watch the magic happen
5. Break up your blocks of focused time into 25 minute chunks with 5 minute breaks in between.
6. Profit

I realize there’s nothing revolutionary about anything I’ve said here. You already have all the innate abilities needed. The only thing needed is practice and discipline. You’ll probably fail for a while until you build the skills and discipline. Give yourself permission to fail and then once more seek to honor thy tomato. And read GTD, for the love of God. 

I know this has been fairly scattered, so please feel free to ask questions or tell me how you do it better. Obviously I can’t point to a 4.0 to say it’s a perfect strategy. But I’m getting stuff done, I’m learning the material, and experiencing no school stress.

**Tools I mentioned**

1. Task managers – Omnifocus (~$50 for pro version w/ student pricing, another $25ish for mobile app, mac/ios only), Asana, Todoist (both free). OF lets you email to-dos right to your inbox or clip from the a webpage. I think the Productivityist website has free info on using Asana
2. Evernote – a freemium app to store pretty much everything in your life with a crazy powerful search and a billion other great features. The mobile app will scan documents from your phone’s camera and store them as .pdfs. Brett Kelly (brettkelly.org) has a great comprehensive e-book on how to get super cool results out of this app for like 7 bucks. I’m sure there’s lots of free guides too. Similar to Omnifocus, you can save articles/pdfs/school documents straight from email or browser, or forward your emails to it to save receipts, bills, etc.
3. WasteNoTime and Self-Control (free) – WasteNoTime is a browser extension to block distracting websites and even limit the amount of time you spend on a website every day (I limit myself to 45 mins of facebook a day). Self-Control is a simpler app that only has a block list, timer, and a start button. Didn’t like it as much bc I can always find something else to be distracted by. WasteNoTime limits the sites you can access to a certain few you need, or none if you want, for however long you want.
4. Pomodoro Timers (free - ~$5) – I use one called “focus timer” that stays on my menu bar at all times. There’s also /r/trackmypomodoros to join if you want. 
5. Studyblue.com (freemium) – website that lets you make flash cards, organized by classes, units, etc, with a decent mobile app, all of which is free. It gives you stats on your progress on how well you know a particular deck, lets you randomize the order, go from answers first, and a few other features. 
6. Spotify Focus Playlists (Free w/ ads) – go to browse -&gt; genres and moods -&gt; focus. There’s classical stuff, atmospheric instrumental rock, mellow hip hop, indie folk, artificial white noise, rain/beach tracks, soft jazz, you name it. Tons of music to help you focus. 
7. *Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity* by David Allen. (normal book prices) and [GTD in 15 Minutes](https://hamberg.no/gtd/) (free)
8. Asian Efficiency website and podcast (free - $$$$) – lots of good stuff about ground-level productivity as well as goal setting and view-from-20,000ft stuff. Their OmniFocus Premium Posts made me into a quasi-wizard for $50. 
9. [Hipster PDA]( http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/03/introducing-the-hipster-pda) possibly free, depending on what you have lying around. 
10. Sriracha – make everything delicious with rooster sauce

3n44lb,38,2015-10-01,Giving up on accounting...what are my options?,acckid13,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/3n44lb/giving_up_on_accountingwhat_are_my_options/,"Hello everyone, today they released list of people getting interviewed after ""Meet the firms."" Unfortunately, I was not even on the list for 1 firm. This isn't your typical crybaby story ""wah I didn't get into big 4 type of deal."" 

This is, I started networking my ass off with the top 15 firms in the area at the start of May. I asked and met with recruiters from all of the firms that recruit at my school. I went to many networking events. I made sure not just to apply to the firms I only like as last year. I had coffee/lunch with at least one person from every firm, on average I spoke with 4 people from each firm during May-August and connected with them. Many of them gave me great feedback about my experience and said I was a great candidate. Ranging from associate to partner. 

I went to mock interviews during this time period, at least 1 with public and 2 with industry places. I am really happy that my school holds these on a constant basis. I got feedback from all of them and improved quite a bit. 

I practiced my elevator speech and even geared it towards each firm and got feedback from the career offices, all of which said I was doing a great job.

I completed all my applications as specified with each firm accurately and in a timely manner. 

I read the guides on here and numerous posts, I went on other websites including youtube to watch interviews etc.. 

My credentials:
*Small Public Firm - Working with high-net-worth individuals, expats/impats, FATCA/OVDP/FBAR, etc.
*Industry - general staff accountant role 
*Finance - Treasury/budgeting 
*3.43 GPA overall/ 3.6 Accounting [Cut off for middle market here is 3.0, and big is 3.2] 
*Leadership program with a firm
*VITA
*Beta Alpha Psi
*Other volunteer events
*State association for CPAs

I had my resume reviewed by family, the university, and friends, no errors were found. 

My personality: It's hard to say you have a good personality without coming off as a cocky bastard, but from the feedback of my previous bosses and people on campus along with professors. many say I am very friendly and an engaging person. I am also known to do pretty well with public speaking and BAP had me do a lot of their speeches for events for this reason. 

Now the issue, I did not get a single invite to one interview,

Not one from the Big 4

Not one from national firms

Not one from regional firms

Not one from smaller firms

I am honestly really baffled at this point, the internship office is baffled, my dad is baffled, my friends are baffled. I am taking this really hard at the moment and I refuse to believe that one firm did not find interest in me. There are 300 interviews going on this week for public firms at the university and to say I am not part of one is kind of pathetic. Here is the real kicker, the same thing happened to me last year. I took a different approach this year, I revamped everything, I came prepared, I took the advice of people from last year, etc. I started early this year, I did all that I could do. I know this sounds like I am telling myself I did not make a mistakes and I am a perfect person. But this time, most of the firms told me that I was great and they were really impressed, along with the career offices, professors, fellow classmates, etc. I thought I did a great a job with everything this year. On average even the most average students got 2-3 interviews a piece. It's like I am black listed from public accounting... and at this point, I am telling myself I am done with accounting. I am not religious but I have convinced my self this is an act of God. There is absolutely no way this happened again to me. I know there are industry jobs and this and that, I did not like it at all. I am a tax guy and there are very few options for us out of college.. Now, I have not one lead, I have already messaged all my contacts asking for feedback, etc. like it matters at this point. 

I think its safe to say that I got the message and I am done with accounting. I am not a quitter but I am redirecting my efforts towards something else. I wasted 5 years of my life for this degree just to not even get one single interview for the only reason I went to school. (I knew I wanted to go to public in high school) 

What can I do with this degree now? I am willing to go back to school again. My GPA isn't the best but that's because I worked 40-50 hours every semester taking 5 courses, I took 6 this summer and worked 40 hours a week. I got a 680 on my GMAT but I didn't study much, I can improve that. I am also looking at law school since I like tax but that's pricey, 100,000.00 minimum w/o aid. 

What masters degree is this a good combo with or second under grad? I want to stay away from a MAcc or MST program..like seriously what could possibly change for my chances of going into one of these places? I don't even know what to do at this point, I know it sounds pathetic but I liked accounting since I was 8...

3n4zyh,2,2015-10-01,(22F) Been getting bitten by something (unknown) for 1+ month. Looking for some insight on how to treat (for now) and what it could possibly be from.,hushgod,AskDocs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/3n4zyh/22f_been_getting_bitten_by_something_unknown_for/,"[Pictures of bites provided here](http://imgur.com/a/CPXkU)

(Sorry this is long and somewhat messy. I'm tired, as I am all the time)

I'm 22F, 5'6"", ~125 lb. Asian student on a semester internship.
Last part is relevant since I am in a totally new environment.
I moved into a new place on August 22. My roommate has 4 cats and 1 puppy. The cats were rescued strays who had apparently been treated, but they're allowed outside and back in without proper washing.
I live in a rather rural-suburban area in the Midwest.

I started noticing that I was getting what seemed to be bug bites that were filling with pus around August 27. I brushed it off to be just a bad reaction to mosquito bites or something.
But they continued to appear and are getting worse.

I'm writing this on October 1 (a little over a month later), and I have 49 bug bites to count.

The bites start off small and non-itchy as they form a skin bubble filled with pus. The bubbles grow as more and more pus fills it, and the bites steadily grow inflamed and itchy.
When they do stop pus-ing, it looks like a small crater with open skin and a small white dot in the center. It looks pretty gross, to be honest.

I thought this could possibly be fleas since the cats are allowed to roam wherever they please, and at first, I was nice, petting them and feeding them. And as cats are wont to do, they rubbed up against me when they were hungry and/or wanted attention.
But the bites started worsening, and I told my landlady (roommate's mom) who got the cats and the house professionally treated. I had never let the pets into my room, and now I stop touching them if possible. I am not sure if my roommates let them into my room, and she drops off my mail and packages in my room and I'm not sure if she lets them in during that time.
Also since then, two of the cats are no longer here (I don't know where they went), but two are still here.

I continued to get bites and suspected bedbugs. Got plastic coverings for my bed and the frame, taped them shut, and still got bitten after.

It's probably not an allergic reaction on my own. I stay at my boyfriend's place during the weekends, and I haven't received any bites there. I usually notice new ones that formed when I return from work.

Now I'm starting to wonder if it's ticks or something, but I'm not a huge outdoorsy person, so I'm not out in the grass or by woodsy areas, even though my workplace is isolated by a fence of large trees (taller than the two-story building I work in).

I have since bought Raid spray for bedbugs and fleas, sprayed my room and my workplace and have been bitten once (before I sprayed my workplace), which was yesterday. Have not noticed new bites since.

I don't seem to be exhibiting other symptoms. I have been feeling fatigued, but I had a severe depressive episode a year and a half ago that has since messed up my sleeping schedule, and I'm just unable to sleep much. And with work happening more recently, I tend to tire very easily, sleep earlier, sleep fewer hours but wake up early as well. And my doctor told me to stop taking naps since that would severely interfere with my daily sleeping schedule.
I'm not sure if the increase in fatigue/sleeping issues is due to work and other stress or to the bites themselves.

However, these bites are driving me insane. It's like when you watch those shows about people hallucinating bugs appearing out of nowhere and crawling all over their body, and they have a freak out and melt-down. I feel mentally drained and my mood is fairly foul, and I feel crazy.
I feel incredibly angry and desperate and violent at times, and the thought of amputating my limbs or cutting out these bites and cauterizing them keep coming to mind (but I won't, so don't worry).
I have taken hydrocortisone before, and it's helped with the itching, but I don't like taking medication unless absolutely necessarily, and I don't fancy taking allergy pills every single day. And I'd prefer a more permanent solution. Treat the cause, not the symptoms sorta thing.
I have otherwise been using hydrocolloid bandages to suck the pus out of the wounds, and they usually fill up within a matter of hours, not days. They do somewhat help with the itching though.
And with regard to the itching, it has woken me while I was sleeping, and I've gotten into the habit of itching around the wound so hard that I've drawn blood and left bruises on myself. My boyfriend was concerned. ._.

I'm going to go see a dermatologist in mid-October. I should have gone to see one earlier, but I figured it would go away on their own. But if anyone has had experiences like this or any advice, I'd greatly appreciate it."

Help? We already had issues in our friendship revolving around my white privilege and his blanket comments about Caucasian individuals (i.e. his comment of ""You white people are so sensitive"" when I was talking about my allergies.), and the futility/lack of value of me trying to educate myself about institutional racism. Other than that, we both worked horrendous hours as students.

He similarly had issues with his boyfriend, who was closeted to his family. Both were students; the boyfriend was a guy I'd asked to get coffee months beforehand, but I became friends with them both (the friend is the one who hasn't spoken to me; the boyfriend is his boyfriend; simply to keep anonymity and consistency with the story). Ergo, me trying not to play favorites. The boyfriend didn't work 30 hours a week like him, so part of their issues were waiting for each other and not having time together (i.e. the boyfriend would go out with friends while the friend expected him to be available when the friend wasn't working, so often one of them was home alone without the other for some reason).

So, while the boyfriend was on a summer internship, I was crashing on their couch. I tried to stay out of the way in terms of cleaning, etc. and while the boyfriend was in CA on said internship, one night they had a fight over the phone and their relationship was up in the air. So, next morning, I saw the friend on Tindr and Grindr, and the next day I mentioned it and he said the boyfriend knew and that they were trying to work on things. 

The friend was diagnosed with anxiety and refused therapy, so he just took his meds. Yet he didn't understand that medication won't teach you how to deal with your problems, it just will stabilize your mood. He also had insurance under the ACA, so while he would laugh about paying nothing for his healthcare compared to others, he would refuse to utilize it for something like therapy. (It just struck me as odd, considering he'd use anxiety as an excuse for his behavior/dismissiveness/ignoring me. Psychology graduate, so it's not like I'm ignorant.)

So, the first time it happened, I tried not to assume the worst: I figured he was seeing who was on those apps and whatnote, and possibly inflating his own ego after a fight. Worst case: cheating after a fight. So when it happened again, I brought it up and clarified that I wasn't trying to pry, but I asked him why he was using them and needed to know if his boyfriend knew. I received no response, as by this time I'd moved into my apartment; so I brought it up to his boyfriend and boyfriend told me that they broke up.

So I haven't heard from my friend since, despite trying to reach out multiple times to see how his semester is going. Apparently his phone number changed or he deleted my number, Facebook isn't happening, so I just don't know what to do.

**tl;dr**: Mandatory summary/question!

Me [21 M] with my gay best friend [21 M] a year and a half, saw him on Tinder/Grindr, asked him about it without making assumptions on why he was there &amp;  him if his boyfriend knew, found out they broke up, and he hasn't spoken to me for two months. What to do?

Power: High.

Intelligence: High.

Energy: Extremely High

Max: 1

Power Drawbacks: All of her automatons cost energy, golem cannot feel emotions unless programmed. Golem must have piece of paper with ""programming"" on it and paper must be taken out one day a week for 24 hours. 

Appearance: Sylvi has light brown skin, dark brown hair, T-shirt and pants which may or not be stained depending if she's too lazy to do her laundry. 

Personality: very flighty, prone to outbursts of excitements if she sees something she sees as cute, (spiders and snakes) bad sense of direction, like Zoro bad.

Backstory: Sylvi was always fasinated with the legend of the golem, that coupled with her obsession with creepy crawlies made her kind of an outcast, she found her solstice by creating clay sculptures and experimenting with coding however. Firmly believing Clarke's Third Law, Sylvi became a intern at Booster Tech, hoping to learn more about AI. One day after creating a clay dog she accidentally gave it life...sort of, it really only barked and rolled over for about 30 minutes but still moved so that was something. Soon after that she was contacted by Virus who gave her a offer to come here with other supers. 

*Sylvi walked by the port, a floppy hat on Reggie's head and a map in his hand.*

""Did I make a wrong turn again Reggie?""

**""NEGATIVE, WE ARE IN THE CORRECT AREA THE MAN KNOWN AS VIRUS SAID THE CRAFT WAS IN.""**

""Really? It's a boat? Well, it's a brilliant idea to bring someone who needs to be on the ground on a ship.""

As some may have noticed, i've been rather absent the last few weeks because of some family stuff (family member's health), internship that takes up most of my days (hence the lack of podcasts), busy with my physique and I think an sort of lack of inspiration.

**If you're wondering, i'm not quitting WiR or the moderating because it's fun to work on it and fun working with you all.**

When I started here in WiR back in juli 2014, I came here with a ton of inspiration and a lot of stuff i'd love to do. I've had the joy of doing a lot of these things and helping out with the moderating here is an honor while I still am busy developing my character to this day (as everyone does), only right now i'm kind of in an moment where I do not know what direction to go with after AMUDOV II.

I've had some ideas, but none match the excitement of those ideas as I had them last year and the last few weeks. It could be due to the stuff in real life while it could also be because I have done a lot already.

Right now I'm doing this amazing feud with EVJ and I have been wanting to work with him for a long time (trust me, you guys will love the match we'll have) and I'm highly interested in working with the newer characters, only I do not know how.

While some ideas are still going around in my head on what I want to do and how I want to do it, it isn't the same feeling I had back when I started.

Perhaps the Dutch character should take a brief break soon to get shit in order in my life and find a good routine to work with, perhaps I should continue the trail I have made here ever since my debut. Moderating and helping with the show won't be taken a break of because it would be more of a burden for the others than a favor for me, besides, it's too much fun seeing the happy comments when a show is put out.

Anywho, I just wanted to throw that out there, perhaps see if there are any ways to figure out some things along the way. Who knows? Untill then, i'm going to continue doing all I can to keep the sub going, keep the Dutchman going and find what I lost a while back (no, i did not lose my smile, you smarks! Hahaha!)

Cheers!

I don't know what to do now.",wayovermyhead321,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3n64r6/20_family_cut_me_off_homeless_in_12_days_i_dont/,"Hello guys, before posting this i have read some other threads on this website that people with a similar problem have made, so I have a plan to try to get a job in the restaurant industry, live in my car, and subscribe to a gym for shower etc but there is a lot I don't know so I would really appreciate your perspective and advice.

I was a college student, for various reasons I went from a 4 year college to a 2 year, and now my parents, who are both overseas, have cut me off. I have never worked a retail or service industry job. I have gone for an internship abroad and I can format a resume to make it attractive for a banker or lawyer, but I have never held a job. I am woefully unprepared for life and I accept that. I need to figure out how I can survive on my own. I do not have friends that I can count on, as I moved from my 4 year college to my 2 year just recently. I also have no family in the US. My family overseas have no desire to help me for the same reasons my parents and I had a falling out.

To clarify, I do not have any drug/alcohol dependency issues, I cannot even afford it anyway. A month ago I had 200 dollars but I spent it on groceries assuming my relationship with my parents would change. In the interim I was going to my 2 year college, and still attending classes, of course, this will no longer be possible in a week. I will be homeless in a week, and my parents who were paying my rent will no longer. I have a car with half a tank of gas, I have no money. I found out that my rent will not be paid and I would not be receiving any more money from my parents two days ago.I do not know what I am going to do with my life. I would really really appreciate some advice.

I will be planning on living out of my car, and I have identified a gym nearby to a Walmart where I can park/sleep, and the gym for hygiene. How should I go about this? I do not know what resources there are available for someone in my situation to take advantage of either. Thank you for taking the time to read this, and hopefully offering some advice. I live in Houston, TX.

EDIT: I just read my post and realized a few things weren't too clear here. 
        1.) The relationship between my parents and I is irreparable.
        2.) I want to continue my education at some point but I don't know what I'm going to do in a week when I'm    turned out of my apartment with no money. I need to figure that out first. I guess I'll deal with FAFSA things later.
        3.) I don't have internet at my apartment, only at my college (in a bid to save money) so if anyone comments later than 10 pm, I won't answer until tomorrow but thank you for your help!

EDIT2: I've tried going to every single recruiter. I am familiar with JROTC through high school. I failed the physical portion of every single recruiter's test. I have an injury on one of my hands that makes the type of movement the military would require impossible.

EDIT 3: My parents and I lived here for 16 years. They left the country 2 years ago to accept positions abroad for work/financial reasons. I am an American citizen and naturalized some time ago.

EDIT 4/UPDATE: Everyone, thank you so much for your help. I was able to do some googling, and I think with some decent application of tenet protection law I can forestall my eviction for like 2.5 weeks max. I will be car camping. I have an interview at a high end Italian restaurant, Saltgrass Steakhouse, and Perry's this upcoming Monday. If I can land one of those jobs before my two weeks are up I should be alright. At that point, I won't need an address since I can take my check at work. My server job should be cash tips nightly. I'll be car camping and using a gym for hygiene, but assuming I get the job next week, I think I'll make it. I figure 3 months car camping and I can start to look for a super cheap apartment. If anyone else has any advice, I'd love to hear it. Thank you all."

3n71r9,3,2015-10-02,"Unusual question about types of companies dealing in data that ""makes a difference""? And opinions on classes",ThrowawayTartan,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/3n71r9/unusual_question_about_types_of_companies_dealing/,"Hey there! 

**Question 1**So I understand that this is a somewhat strange question but I was wondering if anyone knew of any other companies like Palantir which deal with using data to ""make a difference""? 

Okay, I'm exaggerating of course- I think most people feel like their data is making a difference. I'll explain myself more: I'm currently looking around to apply for internships over the Summer of 2016. Last Summer I dealt with data related to health, and predicting if a user would get injured and such. It was a lot of fun, but it was a young startup and it came with a lot of great things, but also some things that weren't necessarily great: 

i) the nature of it being a startup meant that often the data was sparse and I had to get it myself/ I had to do a lot of ground-up work.
ii) There were a lot of deliverables: meaning there were times where efficiency of an algorithm wasn't necessarily what mattered, where a lot of it felt like Google and Stack Overflow were my answers and I wasn't using the best thing that was out there/ approaching the problem the right way.
iii) In some sense I was working with data but with the end goal of a product in mind. The objective was to sell the product, and to sell the product we needed some degree of accuracy. What I imagine/ I'm thinking about in a company is a company that is concerned with making sense of what is happening and then selling that (so kind of the reverse of the startup)

**Q1: Tl;dr care to recommend data companies that deal with ""important data""? Only caveat is that it needs to be in Europe or in America.**

**Question 2** I've been considering a double major in statistics and machine learning to help me in an application to grad school but I don't know how rigorous it actually is. My school is pretty decent when it comes to ML but the courses required for the double surprised me in that they seem more focused on statistics and less about math? Anyone have opinions on whether I should just switch or do the courses that I think are relevant [stat-ml](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/new-majors-launch/program/stat-ml.html) I've been thinking about taking algebraic structures(might just skip this), [linear algebra (really really old syllabus)](http://www.math.cmu.edu/~handron/21_341/03spring/sched.html) - has a pre-req of [matrix algebra](http://www.math.cmu.edu/~handron/21_241/schedule.html) and real analysis on top of the classes that sound more technical on that list. The classes on that list that I think are technical and haven't actually taken yet are 10-701, 15-351, 10-605, 36-401 and 36-402. The others I've either already taken or I think aren't that math-inclined. My problem is that I don't have much time left here so I can't do everything or I definitely would.

**Q2: Tl;dr What should I take classes that are rigorous but not a major that supposedly prepares you for grad school, or a major that supposedly prepares you for grad school (and I get the fancy cert) but I don't think prepares me well enough for grad school.**

Sorry if my questions seem long winded/ if what I'm posting isn't allowed here/ I've come across as a violent asshole who thinks he's really smart and is looking down on things organized by people far smarter than me. I'm just really worried about my future. It's been a long day with a lot of discussions with professors about my future ( on top of having exams) I thought of posting this to /r/datasciencejobs or /r/bigdatajobs but all the posts there I've seen have been posts about hiring and for hire people not necessarily a discussion."

Anything anyone can share about working the position? Interview tips? Thanks."
3n7cum,2,2015-10-02,Just something for myself,Bigblueduck,StopGaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/3n7cum/just_something_for_myself/,"It's pretty late right now, 3 am. It's my weekend because I only have 4 day weeks in school but I still don't want to be up this late. My urges to play are fucking insane right now and I think it's because the League world championships are going on and all the hype around them is making me itch to play. I know if I play I'll feel dead inside in a few days because I won't stop playing. I'll binge and I'll binge and play 8-10 hours for the next few days, not study for my two tests next week and then do bad on them, and then go back to gaming to forget it ever happened. 

This same cycle has gone on for so long. I've been reading posts in the 'top' section for a little while now just to make myself remember all the hard times gaming put me through. It's helping but that itch just won't go away and it's been pretty strong all day. It's so strong because if I don't go back to playing soon I'll never go back and I'm SCARED of that. I'm actually scared of never playing video games again. It's such a weird thing to be scared about but yet here I am. I use gaming to avoid my problems and I've avoided getting any type of internship or job for the past 4 years, happy to game away my college life. But now if I don't go back to games I HAVE to get an internship. I have to graduate. It's required. I can't avoid this. I can't game this away. Why am I so scared all the time?? I used to do anything and everything to try to get ahead but I think my will to achieve has been broken by gaming and weed. I want that shit back damnit. 

I want the ability to want to do good for myself. For so long I've been in a pity party of self hatred and anger and I can't handle it anymore. I need to expunge hate from my life and fill it with love instead. I seriously don't know where all of this came from but it's not me. I'm not me right now. I haven't been me for 4 years. gaming allows me to be someone else and live someone else's life and that's why it scares me that I'll never game again because now I have to live MY life. I can't escape it anymore."

3n7g7a,2,2015-10-02,Why can't I get a job?,ftplc,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3n7g7a/why_cant_i_get_a_job/,"I graduated in may with a bachelors degree in computer science and have been grinding out applications every day for four solid months now.

It's from a real university, I was involved with activities including multiple leadership roles, had an internship as a software engineer at a fortune 500 company, and can actually program.

I've put out at least 10 applications a day, averaging 1.4 interviews a week. Technical interviews are exhausting. Flying out across the country for interviews is exhausting. Both have so far been complete wastes of my time in every instance. I know when I make mistakes and I really don't make many these days, but I'm never good enough apparently.

Nothing. 

I've been reading &gt;200 pages a day to get better at interviews. I've gone though at least thirty books, the pile is getting ridiculous, repeating a few up to a half dozen times.

Nothing.

I've cranked out personal project after personal project, have four that I'm happy with enough to share with employers. Total of over 5000 lines of different languages from the last two months alone.

Nothing.

It's crushing. It doesn't get better. I live in my mother's attic and I'm not getting younger. I can't sleep. I'm gaining weight without eating somehow. I'm not advancing in life and have pretty much zero social life. I even got dumped two weeks into the summer. 

95% of online ads are for people with years and years of experience. Junior and entry level positions requiring 3+ or 5+ years. All of them want a ridiculous list of very specific skills. Few of them ever respond even if you spend two hours researching the company to put together a cover letter and finding recruiters to contact directly. 

Nothing.

I can do the job but either I'm too weird to be employable or I'm too stupid to know that I suck. 

The worst part is that it's very possible that it's the former and that I have no hope.

I had a friend who graduated a semester before me who was in a similar position and only lasted five months before killing himself. Maybe it was a different position, hard to tell. Either way, I think that I understand that thought process a lot better now than I did then. 

Each day is just a little worse than the one before it. Even attempting to do something that doesn't directly contribute to getting a job feels like stealing time from myself. I can't enjoy anything except drinking. I've probably always had depression but it's a very different thing once you have nothing to do except hate yourself and be reminded of your ongoing failures which have no end in sight.

I am an 8th semester intern at UBCC and spent 90% of my shift yesterday converting ICD-9 to 10. I know most of you are probably just as confused as we are but I want to know what code you were using for joint restrictions/subluxation/alerted joint segment integrity.

We were told by our clinic director to use M99.0x. Shouldn't we be using M99.1x, as it is a higher level code? I just wanted some input from any docs who have been to seminars or training courses. I watched the PayDC seminar, but not much was mentioned.

Thank you in advance."

Eagles|
:---|
WR **Jordan Matthews** has recorded at least six receptions in each of his last four games and can become just the second Eagle since 1960 to record five-consecutive games of 6+ catches. WR **Irving Fryar** was the last Eagle to accomplish the feat, recording 6+ catches in five-straight games from Oct. 13, 1996 to Nov. 10, 1996. Additionally, Matthews is one of only six players in the NFL with an active streak of at least four games with 6+ receptions, joining Pittsburgh WR **Antonio Brown** (15 games), New England WR **Julian Edelman** (10), Denver WR **Emmanuel Sanders** (six), Dallas TE **Jason Witten** (four) and Washington TE **Jordan Reed** (four). In Week 3, **Matthews** became the first Eagle since **Fryar** in 1997 to lead the team in both receptions and receiving yards in four consecutive games. Over the span, Matthews has accumulated 30 receptions for 336 yards and two touchdowns.|
After rushing for only 21 yards on 11 carries through first two games, Eagles RB **DeMarco Murray** missed Week 3, and his status for Sunday is uncertain|
RB **Ryan Mathews** is the team’s leading rusher in his first year in Philadelphia. Mathews has recorded a team-high 29 carries for 112 yards (3.9 avg.) with one rushing touchdown.|
The **Eagles Offense** has scored touchdowns on five of their eight trips in the red zone this season and have limited their opponents to only three touchdowns in their eight ventures inside the 20.|
Against the Jets, the **Eagles Defense** held New York to 47 yards rushing on 16 carries (2.9 avg.), marking the first time the team has held their opponent to under 50 rushing yards since Nov. 20, 2011 at the New York Giants (29 yards).|
The **Eagles defense** has not allowed an individual 100-yard rusher in each of their last 15 games and have allowed only one rusher to hit the century mark in their last 27 games, including playoffs (then-49ers RB Frank Gore, 9/28/14).|
The **Eagles defense** is allowing their opponents only 3.11 yards per carry, which leads the league through Week 3. The Birds are one of four teams that have yet to surrender a rushing score in 2015, joining the Bengals, Chiefs and Steelers.|
The **Eagles defense** has allowed only four rushes of 10+ yards through the first three weeks, which is tied for second in the NFL.|
The **Eagles defense** has forced at least one turnover in nine straight games and has recorded 21 total turnovers during that span. Philadelphia ranks tied for third in the league with eight total takeaways and five interceptions through the first three games of the season.|
After picking off Jets QB **Ryan Fitzpatrick** in Week 3, S **Walter Thurmond** became one of just six safeties in the NFL this season to have notched two picks. Thurmond also picked off Falcons QB **Matt Ryan** in the season opener.|
With his dynamic 89-yard punt return TD and a 1-yard rushing score against the Jets, RB **Darren Sproles** became one of just four players in NFL history to record at least two career games with both a punt return touchdown and a rushing touchdown, joining Hall of Famer **Gale Sayers**, **Ockie Anderson** and **Curly Oden**|
RB **Darren Sproles** is the only player in NFL history to record 15+ rushing touchdowns (18), 25+ receiving touchdowns (27) and 5+ punt return touchdowns (six) during his career.

Redskins|
:---|
The Redskins are playing in their third home game in the first four weeks of the season. The last time the Redskins had three home games in the first four weeks of a season came in the midst of a 3-1 stretch to start the 2003 season.|
The Redskins look to hold the Eagles to 85 or fewer rushing yards.  If they can, it would be the fourth consecutive game this season.  The last time the Redskins managed this was during Weeks 12-16 of the 1989 season.|
QB **Kirk Cousins** had a career-high of 427 pass yards against the Eagles on 9/21/14. If Cousins can throw for 255 yards  he will become the 17th quarterback in Redskins history to record 4,000 passing yards with the team.|
Since entering NFL in 2012, RB **Alfred Morris** is 2nd in NFL with 4,161 rush yards &amp; 3rd with 28 rush TDs.  He aims for his 3rd home meeting in row with rushing TD.  He is currently 5th on the Washington All-time Rushing list behind Stephen Davis, Larry Brown, Clinton Portis, and John Riggins.

WR **DeSean Jackson** has 9 catches for 243 yards (121.5 per game) &amp; a TD (81 yards) in the last 2 games against his former team.|
TE **Jordan Reed** leads team with 19 catches &amp; 241 yards.|

3n856l,178,2015-10-02,[Update]: My wife and I have a (now one-year-old) baby. Her breast cancer has returned and its Stage 4.,bigtimeguard6887,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3n856l/update_my_wife_and_i_have_a_now_oneyearold_baby/,"I've begun and deleted this post so many times because I simply don't know how to write it, so this is just me casting that aside and writing the damn thing. A few people have PM'd me asking for an update on our situation so I decided to oblige with a full fledged post on what happened following my initial post that I made during the time of initial diagnosis and where we are now. Here is the original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3a319y/my_wife_and_i_have_a_9_month_old_baby_we_just/


As a recap, after I sent my wife to the hospital on the 14th of June after about three months of pain in her bones and finally in her neck, scans and blood tests revealed that her breast cancer had returned with a wicked vengeance. It was immediately classified Stage 4 metastatic breast cancer due to its spreading in her bones, liver, and lung.


We have gone through the two years (this November 9th) of our marriage and the five years of our relationship knowing her history but neither or us expected it to come back, let alone so suddenly or severely. She had Stage One breast cancer at 22, and rather than mess around with possibly having it return (yeah indeed), she had a bilateral mastectomy and a full round of chemotherapy. Her fiancé at the time dumped her because he didn't wish to be with a sick woman and she restarted her life after she got well. She was cancer free for 8 years and we were blindsided for sure, since five years is generally considered passing the threshold for cancer returning. We married on November 9th of 2013 and September 9th of 2014 our baby boy was born.


After she was diagnosed on June 17th a whirlwind of events began and continued through the hell that was this entire summer, for her and me and our now one-year-old son. Donations began rolling in, both material and monetary through a GoFundMe that a dear friend started, a Facebook support page that grew to over 1700 members, an article in our local newspaper as well as more prayers, positive thoughts, and well wishes than I could ever anticipate. As a very private person (my wife too), much of this came as a big surprise that we didn't really expect. I can't express my gratitude enough.


It all turned out to be a big help. In addition to bills (we live in New Jersey in the U.S. and naturally our insurance only covers so much), it all has come at a very critical time because she is now unable to work for an indefinite time while undergoing her aggressive and debilitating chemo treatments. It was difficult for me to keep it together over the course of the summer in all aspects, from taking care of my work responsibilities to caring for her and the baby with every ounce of help given by friends and family appreciated immensely. I can't imagine what she's been going through, and facing, but I know for me all the possibilities have been terrifying. I broke down several times, one of the worst being when we had to have the discussion about potential end of life care and establishing a last will and testament.


It scares me to death even thinking about the possibility. I wake up everyday and push the thought out of my mind as I look at my wife sleeping peacefully with no hair left on her head.


She's a fighter though. One I feel I could never be; I married her for her strength and it's humbling to bear witness to it. She raises the baby as he walks around the house making trouble, and I struggle to keep up with work as best I can (I work for a pool company and with summer over now, hours and work are dwindling and will soon be bare bones) along with finishing school which includes unpaid internships in both the fall and spring that have to be completed before I can start my career. Money is very tight and this winter is going to be really tough.


It's hard. It's really fucking hard. But we're keeping our heads up. We are hoping beyond hope that the latest blood test showing her tumor markers significantly down is a sign she's responding to treatment and getting better.


All I can say is thanks for listening (reading). October is breast cancer awareness month, which is part of what prompted me to write this. Wherever you see a pink ribbon, or banners at an event, think of my wife. Think of all the ladies (and men) you have known or know who are fighting this battle. Because it's literally a fight for life.


Thank you all for reading.

3n859i,1,2015-10-02,Boyfriend pushing me away due to depression; is this over?,toomuchmilkandhoney,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/3n859i/boyfriend_pushing_me_away_due_to_depression_is/,"My boyfriend and I have been together for almost two and a half years. We met in his country in 2013 and have been maintaining a long distance relationship since then, visiting often. We were also able to spend almost a year together, traveling around my country and parts of Asia. We have always had an extremely strong and loving and completely honest partnership. We had to unexpectedly go back to long distance in order for me to finish the internship phase of my MA; this was a huge blow. We have both struggled a lot with the distance, especially after that year of being together; it’s always hit me harder and I’ve been depressed for quite a while.  Ultimately, though, we finally have very good and workable plans to close the distance at the end of the year (under three months from now) wherein I move to his city on a working visa. 

For the past few weeks, he has become so depressed by a combination of starting a rigorous academic program in a new city, his lack of a social life due to some health problems (issues with his voice, which are doubling frustrating because he is a singer), and his feelings that he needs to support me from so far away. He has always been a somewhat negative person but he’s certainly always been there to talk me through stress or sadness. I’m currently working 60 hours a week (most of it an unpaid internship) and taking two classes, so stress has been running high with me and I could really use even a small amount of support from him. Instead, he wants to take an indefinite break from all forms of speaking to get a handle on his life and depression. He said that talking to me always erupts into a big emotional conversation and he is just not currently equipped to “have time for me” (his words). I’m trying to see it his way and be understanding as I know that can’t be easy. I have asked if I can help him in any way (as I have extensively in the past with his anxiety) and got a pretty emphatic “no” as he said he can deal with his problems on his own. I got on with the not talking and tried to better myself independently and seek out other means of support (friends, hobbies, etc) but i just can’t seem to wrap my mind around being pushed away or suddenly being such a negative thing in his life. This is a very big change in how our relationship has always been. We've gone from talking every day, throughout the day about everything to not speaking at all.

I broke and contacted him after 5 days (which seemed like forever to me) to ask how he’d been feeling in general and about the not talking. He said he didn’t feel anything about it because “it has only been 5 days” and then I inevitably got upset and he, essentially, told me that this was why he didn’t have time for me in his life right now. I’ll add that this is all via text because he can’t physically speak, so it was doubly hard to really understand what is going on. I’m just at such a loss as to what to do; a month ago, 5 days would’ve been unbearable for both of us.

I think that the only thing I can do for him as a good partner right now is to just let him be. I’m already not relying on him for support (though I’m also going through pretty substantial depression) but I’m also just not going to contact him until he contacts me. He assured me that I was being really dramatic, this seems regular to him (despite us never doing anything like this before), and that our relationship is not ending. He also told me to relax and he loves me. It just feels like it is ending, though; it feels like I've lost my partner and he doesn’t find my presence comforting in the way he used to. He's also become so cold and kind of cruel. Furthermore, I’m in the process of working out my visa and moving my entire life pretty soon and I don’t even know if that’s still the plan; it’s been made clear that I can’t talk him about it without being a further detriment, but I really need to sort of all of this out. I don't want to give up or end this because I love him very much and I'm really concerned about him. We've both given so much of ourselves to this and have actual plans to finally end the distance that we were both so excited about. I think, for it to end now, would be cheap and not indicative of how our relationship has been for two and a half years. This is the hardest this relationship has ever been and I'm pretty scared, though.

Has anyone else had a strong partnership that suddenly changed to your partner pushing you away entirely? Has anyone ever had a period of not talking? Does this essentially seem like it’s over? Did I write waaaaay to much in this message?"
3n8cld,72,2015-10-02,My Freddy Adu story,CameranAlavi,MLS,https://www.reddit.com/r/MLS/comments/3n8cld/my_freddy_adu_story/,"Thought I would share this personal story from my time as an intern with the Philadelphia Union:

One day as the workday was coming to an end, I was instructed by one of my bosses to stop by Freddy Adu’s apartment in downtown Philly and give him a package we had just received at our office. Even though it wasn’t going to be very enjoyable driving through Center City during rush hour, and trying to find parking around his apartment complex, I still recognized how awesome of an opportunity it could be to finally meet the kid whose first game I attended way back when he was a 14-year-old in DC. 

So anyway, I finally arrive at his place and walk into the lobby; it’s one of the nicest apartment buildings in the entire city, right on Broad St. next to City Hall. I go up to the receptionist and tell her why I’m there, and she rings up to his room.

“Mr. Adu? One of the team interns is here with a package for you. Shall I take it down here or send him up there?”

Sure enough, he responds: “Send him up, that’s fine.” I was pumped! And as excited as I was just to meet him, I was even *more* excited when he asked me to “hang out for a bit” after I gave him his package.

Now, I had always heard negative things about Freddy in regards to his work ethic, personality, et cetera, but I was pleased to find out how welcoming he was to an intern he had only really seen in passing here and there around the stadium and office. He offered me some water, asked me how my time as an intern was going, and just genuinely seemed to want to hang out with me. As sort of an icebreaker, he decided that we should play a game of FIFA on his Xbox 360. I warned him that I was an expert when it came to this kind of stuff, but he just said “No problem, you got nothing on me.”

So we’re playing FIFA. After much coercion, I convinced him to play as Real Madrid while I was controlling the Philadelphia Union (with Freddy playing up top, of course); he initially didn’t want to play with unbalanced teams, but I finally got the message across that I was legitimately good at this game. We started out playing, chatting, occasionally laughing, and frequently yelling at the TV. And then I scored my first goal, a Freddy Adu header off a Sheanon Williams cross. He took it well, though, and even cracked a joke about how he wished he was that clinical in real life (*+1 for self-awareness*). Ironically, off the ensuing kickoff, I immediately stole the ball with in-game Freddy, dribbled through half of the Spanish national team, and slotted a side-footed effort past Casillas. Seeing as this was my one chance at ever doing something like this, I had to throw a little gloating in there; after all, I was pretty proud of myself. 

“Too easy,” I said. But I will say I’m not really the type to talk trash or even to brag (I don't even do celebrations when I score a goal online), so that was really the only controversial thing I said all game.

At this point, the laughter and openness of the room from when I first walked in was long gone, and had been replaced by tension and frustration. This game is serious stuff, people. Anyway, a few more minutes passed, I scored a few more goals, and he had a few cracks at my goal with Cristiano and Benzema, but he had no luck at all against Stonewall MacMath. When the referee blew for halftime, it was *Philadelphia Union 5, Real Madrid 0, with a Freddy Adu hat-trick*. I pulled out my cell phone to take a picture of the TV screen and show my friends, but that was the final straw on the camel’s back, apparently.

He told me “No pictures man, please. That’s enough, I think you gotta go.” In 20 minutes, he had gone from inviting me up to hang out with him out of the goodness of his heart to kicking me out of his apartment over a video game. 

I’m not going to throw in any personal opinions, but I will say that for the rest of my internship, he never looked my way again. But hey, at least it was a memorable experience?

EDIT: I said ""Too easy"" in a celebratory way as a gut reaction, not as a methodical/purposeful way to rile him up. I was just proud of the goal I had just scored. When I wanted to take a picture, that was just for myself in order to have a concrete memory of the event. If someone were nice enough to invite me into their home, *I would never purposefully disrespect them*. FIFA just gets you going, I guess."

3n8w29,0,2015-10-02,I [20M] have an internship offer with a fantastic company. However it's 3 hours away from where my girlfriend [20F] of two years will likely work after graduation. Help?,axcvbgfds,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3n8w29/i_20m_have_an_internship_offer_with_a_fantastic/,"I am a junior MIS student attending a state school in Texas.  This week I attended a Career Fair and I had a lot of success.  To provide context, I have an usually high amount of experience and technical ability compared to some of my classmates.  I am very good at interviewing.  I had 4 interviews yesterday, and I think I killed it in each one.  Two interviewers openly told me during the interview that there will be a second interview and that I am a very strong candidate.  One company called me that evening to extend a verbal offer.  Let’s call this company Big Oil for clarity and so I don’t have name the firm.

 

My girlfriend is the sweetest, most caring person I know.  I love her more than anything else in my life.  We are taking our relationship day by day, but I seriously see my future with her.  However, she has been less lucky in the job hunt game.  She is a Marketing major with a comparable GPA to me.  Her work experience is exclusively retail, although she did very well in those jobs.  Due to her very warm personality, she is a less concerned with her career and may come across a bit less professional in her interactions.  That’s fine, different people have different roles in business!  She has started to warm up and become focused on getting an internship this year.  She is applying for a Supply Chain Management concentration to make herself a more marketable candidate.  This Career Fair she did not get an interview, but many of the programs to which she would like to apply are not yet recruiting.  I say this not to brag but for perspective.

 

Now, about 3 months ago we had a very frank discussion about our future.  We realized it was vital for the health of our relationship long-term to work in nearby areas to each other after graduation.  I suggested and we both agreed to look primarily for jobs in the Dallas-Fort Worth area (DFW).  It is close, growing economically, many companies that recruit at our school are based in DFW, and generally a good place to live and (someday) start a family.  It seemed like (and remains to be) a good course of action.

 

The company I am considering (Big Oil) is a mid-size oil and gas company.  They have been hurt by the recent downturn in oil prices but less so than other companies.  Their IT department is growing at comparable rates than before the downturn.  Their internship program is very good.  The full time prospects after graduation are great.  Starting pay is above industry (hovering around 75k) with a very large signing bonus.  However, this company that I have an offer with is based in a surrounding city of Houston.  Not in Houston (Houston is a humid, sprawling, metropolitan mess) but about 30 minutes from it in a planned, pretty city.  Looks like a damn Norman Rockwell painting.

 

To the problem: I would feel hypocritical pursuing a company that is 3 hours away from our agreed destination of DFW.  I don’t want to ask her to change her career path, and I think she may be less fortunate than me when it comes to finding a job.  Finding a job in DFW is relatively easy.  Finding a job in Big Oil’s city would be harder.  I fear the health of my relationship if I pursue this.  I am not good at long distance; I am a physical person.  I am not content to live 3 hours apart for too long, but this is also an excellent company to start a career with.

 

Furthermore, the offer with this company will likely expire before second round interviews with other companies!  I think I have good prospects with these companies but the pay is less and bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.  It’s a tricky situation with no clear solution (to me).

 

I plan to talk to her about this on the weekend, but I want to know a bit more where my head is before I do.

 

I apologize for being verbose; I didn’t want to leave out any detail.

 

**tl;dr: I am entertaining an internship offer with a good company that is likely 3 hours away from where my girlfriend will be working.  I fear that pursuing this company may break our relationship after college.**"
3n937t,3,2015-10-02,Office Women Part 11: Happy Hour with Yan and more,Scast716585,sexstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexstories/comments/3n937t/office_women_part_11_happy_hour_with_yan_and_more/,"I made it through the rest of Friday afternoon feeling great about everything. Having been with Angela in the morning and my double lunch time special with Sue and Courtney things were looking good and I was heading to Yan’s for her happy hour. I stopped and picked up a few bottles of wine and was at her place by 5:45. She said 5:30 would be good so I figured I would have heard some noise from the others she was having over when I knocked on her door. The door opened and Yan said in a quiet voice behind the door, “Please take off your shoes and leave them here” She then shut the door behind me and stood there quietly looking at me. I was very surprised, no one else appeared to be here and Yan was standing in front of me wearing a long silk robe. 

“Please come sit, would you like tea or I can open wine if you like” she said to me,  motioning to her couch where she had snacks and teas set on a coffee table. 

“Some tea would be nice” I replied as I went and sat on the couch. 

“Thank you for coming, sorry there is no happy hour party, just me, I try to make you happy” Yan said as she poured me some tea. “”Courtney said you good man and that you, I don’t know how to say in English, uhm well you good man” Yan said trying to find her words in English. 

“Everything is fine, I am glad to spend some time with you alone, you are a very bright and beautiful young woman” I replied. And she was looking very beautiful, her long black hair brushing over her shoulder, her big brown eyes and cute little mouth. The robe revealed some of her bare chest and when she sat next to me the robe slid open to show her thin firm legs that looked so good earlier today in her mini skirt. 

Yan giggled at my compliment and said “thank you, you are so kind” As she said this she placed her hand on my thigh. I placed my hand on hers and held it for a moment. She awkwardly looked away and then looked into my eyes. I placed my other hand on the back of her head and softly stroked her hair. She then leaned up toward me and I met her with a soft kiss that then deepened. I ran my hand down her back softly and noticed that it felt like there was nothing beneath the robe just her soft young flesh. I was incredibly aroused my cock pressing hard against my pants begging to be released. 

When our kiss broke she looked away from me seemingly feeling a little embarrassed. The whole time I was still holding her tiny hand on my thigh. I took a sip of my tea and sat back into the couch. Yan looking down at me giggled a little. I asked “what is funny?” She replied “Nothing funny, I am embarrassed I give you, how you say, hard on” 

“Don’t be embarrassed, you are very sexy, I am sure you give lots of guys a hard on” I said as I leaned in and kissed her again. As I did I slid her hand up my thigh and placed it onto my throbbing dick. She broke the kiss and focused on undoing my belt, unzipping my pants and pulling out my cock. “Oh, it sooo big, Chinese men are small, I never seen one so big except in porno movie” Yan immediately grabbed my cock in her hand that looked tiny around my huge cock and dropped her head down to suck on me. She could comfortably fit the tip of my swollen cock in her mouth but she sure gave it a good effort. Licking all of my cock and sucking on my balls and trying to put as much of me as possible into her mouth. I stroked her hair and rubbed her back and slid my hand down onto her ass, confirming she was wearing nothing under the robe. I started to pull up her robe as she knelt over me sucking away and just as I was about to uncover her young tight ass for my viewing pleasure she stood up. “Come with me, we go to bedroom” she said as she grabbed my hand. I stepped out of my pants and underwear and followed her, my cock leading me like a heat seeking missile eagerly anticipating exploring Yan’s naked body. 

As we entered her bedroom she undid my shirt and pulled it off onto the floor. “Please lay down, I will be right back” she offered. I laid naked on the bed my cock standing straight up at attention. She returned after a couple of minutes, still in her robe and holding a large bowl of water. “You like if I give you sponge bath??” She asked. “Yes that would be nice” Not expecting this at all I figured what the hell, I am so used to women just wanting to suck or climb on my big fat cock and get at it I thought this would be enjoyable. 

“Ok you just lay there relax and enjoy” Yan said as she grabbed a towel and soaked it in the warm water. She started with my hands and arms, and moved onto my chest and face. As she leaned over me she smelled wonderful and her soft gentle touching and pampering me was getting me more aroused. She had me sit up and lean forward wiping my neck and back gently caressing me with the warm towel and kissing me on the neck. She dried my back and laid me down. She then washed my feet and lower legs slowly working her way up to my thighs, wiping me and drying me as she progressed until she was up to my groin, my cock now as hard as it could possibly be. She paused and looked at me, untied her robe and dropped it to the floor. She stood there naked in front of me, her body is perfect, She is thin, petite and fit, her ass is perfect shapely and firm and her tits are true perfection. Full C in size but very firm and the sexiest dark small nipples that stuck straight out more than an inch. God I wanted to suck on those tits. I knew she was cute and had a nice body but I did not realize how perfect and sexy she was until she was here now standing naked in front of me. I sat up to grab her. “No you lay back, I will take care of you” she demanded and I complied. I laid down my cock standing up feeling it was so big it would hit the ceiling. Yan refreshed the towel and began cleaning my balls and cock. “Steve just relax, Yan going to take care of you and you will take care of Yan in time” she said as she continued to rub my cock. 

I leaned forward to feel her tit that was gently rubbing against my stomach as she washed my cock. “Oh Steve you are bad boy, I tell you to relax and be still, I fix that” she said as she went over to her dresser. She returned with a pair of padded handcuffs and wrapped one around each wrist and tied each arm to the bed post so I could no longer move them. “You have been bad, now you will be good, I will take care of you.” Yan climbed on top of me straddling my chest facing away from me and returned to sucking my cock. The view of her perfect ass kneeling over me and her beautiful perfectly waxed pussy staring at me was driving me crazy as she sucked and rubbed my cock. I was totally shocked by Yan, I would have never guessed she had handcuffs and would actually use them. She then slid up my chest and placed her pussy in my face, there was no hesitation I started licking every part of her smooth clean sweet smelling little pussy. She loved this and started letting out high pitched moans of ecstasy. She stoked my cock as she sat on my face having me please her until she came, squirting her juices all over my face. 

“I want you to fuck me now with you big cock” Yan said as she swung around me and squatted over my cock facing me. She held my cock and positioned it against her pussy. She very slowly squatted down onto my enormous hard cock. “You are so big, and I am so small” she cried softly trying to inch down over me. I could feel her stretching around me, she was much tighter than Courtney almost like fucking a virgin ass her pussy was so tight. I pressed up hard against her driving in a few more inches surprising her and she dropped down onto me so I was fully in. She sat there for a moment trying to get used to my girth. Those fabulous tits staring right at me I wanted to grab them but I could not move my arms. I just reveled in the feeling of my cock fully inside of her and Yan started to slide back up on me and began moving up and down slowly grinding on my cock. She felt so tight and so warm and wet it was incredible. Yan rode up and down my shaft over and over and went faster and faster until she was finally slapping against me on the way down, now fully accepting of my cock. She still felt wonderful and tight and I was not going to be able to hold it much longer. “I am going to cum” I announced. She hopped off of my cock and put her face right next to it as she jerked me until I shot a huge load all over her face. I don’t think a drop went in her mouth but I think that is what she wanted as she aimed my shots to hit her in the face. She sat up looking at me with her cum covered face. “You like” she said. “Yes I like very much I replied, now can you unchain me so I can hold you.” I asked. 

There was then a knock on her door and she yelled “Hold on I will be right there” “Steve I will go see who it is and send them away. You wait here” she grabbed the towel from the sponge bath and wiped the cum off her face and threw on her robe. “Oh wait this first.” She said as she ran to her dresser grabbed something and came over to me and put a blindfold on me. I could hear her quickly shut the door behind her and her run out of the room. I laid there thinking that I had no idea that she was so kinky. 

After a few minutes I heard Yan come back into the room, “Her I brought you a bottle of water, drink. Also, take this it is Chinese medicine will make you feel good” she dropped a pill in my mouth and I swallowed, figuring she has taken care of me so I trusted her. “Is everything ok” I asked, “Who was at the door”. “It was just my neighbor, I sent her away” she replied. Not saying another word she started sucking my limp cock, now being able to take the whole thing in her mouth, she rubbed my balls while sucking and pushed her breasts against my body. After a few minutes of this I started to grow, which surprised me a little due to all of the sex I had today. But I just laid back and enjoyed it, my hands still tied and the blindfold on there was nothing to do but enjoy it. Yan released me from her mouth and placed my cock between her breasts and slowly rubbed up and down the length of me. This had gotten me fully hard. I then felt her mouth go back down onto and over my cock this time she was able to easily swallow all of me, right down into her throat and she quickly bobbed up and down on my cock taking the whole thing from tip to base every time, she was incredible at this why did she take so little before when she could do this. I now was fully hard again. I then felt her squat over my face again smothering me with her pussy and I wanted to return the favor for the great blowjob she was giving me so I started licking her clit, her lips and into her hole. It seemed to me that she was bigger, maybe it was from fucking me that I stretched her and I thought I felt some bush hair against my chin. But I did not think too much I was enjoying eating her pussy and she seemed to really like it the way she was moaning. I then felt a pair of hands reach down on my face and remove the blindfold. I squinted my eyes to acclimate to the light and looked at the scene around me. I was totally shocked when I realized what was happening. That was not Yan on my face but it was Ashley, the young girl from accounting with the huge tits that I fucked behind the bar at happy hour. And I was not surprised to find Katie, the administrative assistant that blew me and fucked me one night after work. It had to be her because no girl sucks a cock like “Cock Sucking Katie” as I found out she was known in college and there standing watching the three of us in action were Yan and Courtney with their arms around each other soaking in all that we were doing. 

Courtney walked over to me, I kept eating pussy, “Steve, I talked Yan into this last night, she needed a big cock and from what she told me just now she really liked what you gave her, and we then all came up with this plan of sharing your big cock tonight. Oh, and that pill you took before that was a Viagra, so you big dick will be able to perform all night until all four of us have had enough Steve dick, that ok with you, well I guess it will have to be because we are not going to let you free until we are done, and you know how much I like to fuck”  

With that Ashley spun around on my face so she could look down at me and I could look up at her huge tits bouncing around while I ate her pussy. “Steve, you are really good at that make me cum will you baby, oh yeah baby eat my pussy” She said holding my head tight against her. I kept going trying to focus on her pussy while Katie was sucking my cock, which was hard to do. “Steve you are going to fuck me now, I need that cock in me” Katie spoke in her little high pitched voice. I could feel her slide down on top of me stretching her sweet pussy around my cock. All the time eating Ashley, which my effort was paying off as she pushed down hard against me and shook coming to orgasm. She rolled off of me and lay there looking so sexy being naked next to me. I then looked down at beautiful Katie naked on top of me her perky hard tits sticking out and her tight sweet pussy grinding on top of me, her eyes closed grinding away on my in total bliss. 

I did not have a moment to breath as Courtney climbed on top of my face placing her pussy right over my mouth. Exchanging one great view for another. I started in on Cortney’s little pussy enjoying my second go of the day on her. I also got my hips in a nice rhythm fucking Katie as she was now letting out these high pitched squeals from our fucking. God I wished my hands were free so I could grab Katie’s hips and grind into her even better or at least hold Courtney’s little ass or feel her nice young breasts. I heard Katie scream loudly and tense around my cock stopping her thrusting as she came. She then fell onto the bed exhausted. My cock standing there hard and ready for its next pussy. “Yan climb on Steve’s cock, you could use another fuck” Courtney suggested. Yan obliged and gently slid down onto my cock once again barely able to squeeze me into her little pussy. All the while I was eating Courtney until she had what she wanted and came on me. Cortney and Ashley rested their heads on my chest as they watch Yan slide her over stretched pussy up and down my shaft. “You ready for more pussy Steve” Katie asked in her mousy little voice, which just hearing her got me hot. Not to mention the perfect 20 yo Asian girl sliding up and down on my cock I was ready for anything. Katie sat on my face so she was looking at Yan enjoying her ride on my cock. I then attacked her pussy with my tongue wanting to please her so. Katie let out a moan and pushed back down on my face, smothering me with her ass. “Rim me Steve, rim my little ass hole” she begged. I was not usually into this but how could I say no to such a perfect little specimen. I started licking around the edge of her ass, it was driving her crazy and she started rubbing her clit as I did it. 

As I focused my attention on Katie’s ass I did notice Yan cum one more time from riding my cock. Having fucked and cum so many times earlier today I was not close to cumming, they all felt great riding my cock and they knew what they were doing giving me the Viagra because I was rock hard waiting for another pussy to climb on. “Ashley, go ahead I have already been fucked by Steve today so go for a ride, enjoy that big hard cock.” Courtney offered. “I don’t mind if I do” Ashley replied and climbed on top of me. My cock easily slid into her and she started working hard on top of me. At the same time Katie came releasing me from her ass. I looked up at Ashley smiling and grinding on top of me. “My god your tits are fantastic can someone please grab them, I want to so bad. “Courtney went around behind Ashley and grabbed both of her big floppy tits and kissed her on the neck much to Ashley’s surprise. Ashley then turned and French kissed Courtney, never stopping her grinding. As they kissed Courtney slid one hand down to Ashley’s pussy to feel my hard shaft sliding in and out of her and then started rubbing her clit. This got Ashley very excited and she increase the speed of her grinding until after a few minutes she came again. 

Ashley slid off of me and Courtney immediately climbed on top of my still hard cock and furiously fucked away. I think she helped Ashley along because she couldn’t take watching all of these other girls fucking me and she needed me inside of her. She screamed “Yes I love your cock, fuck, fuck, fuck” and she rode me hard. She was starting to get used to my size but she still felt so good to me. I wanted to cum in her again but my balls were dry and I had to keep thrusting up into her it felt so good. We were both soaked in sweat after 5 minutes of hard grinding and Courtney finally let out a loud yell and violently shook on my cock cumming hard. 

“Yoo hoo, ride him girl, hey I thought I saw some wine when we came in how about a drink” Ashley said

“Yes, Steve brought it, I will get some glasses and an opener” Yan added as they all walked out the room. 
“Hey, what about me, you can’t just leave me here like this” I yelled as they walked out. Courtney turned and looked at me my arms still bound to the bed and my cock still rock hard “We will be back we are not done with you yet, as long as you have that” She said staring at my cock. 

They all laughed and walked out of the room, still all of them naked. As I watched them leave I was not upset because they all looked so hot, what a collection of young hot bodies and beautiful young women. 

They returned after a moment all with wine and enjoying themselves. Courtney was feeling both Ashley’s and Yan’s breasts doing some type of comparison “Well Ashley yours are much bigger but Yan, yours are good size and so perky, I can’t decide which I like more, mine are so small in comparison” she said as she was rubbing both girls tits, getting them all aroused. Katie sat next to me on the bed, her glass of wine in one hand and my cock in the other, mindlessly stroking it as she watched the other girls. 

I heard a phone vibrate and Ashley searched through her clothes on the floor and pulled out her phone. “Hey look, it is Linda, Hey Linda what you doing….no I can’t make it there I am in the middle of my own little happy hour here…I am at Yan’s you know that new intern at the office, I was going out with Katie and she knows Courtney the other new girl from school so we headed over to Yan’s we also have another friend here, hold on let me put you on face time” Ashley said as she switched her phone to video “You recognize this??” Ashley said as she positioned the phone to show my hard cock sticking up in the air. 

“Steve, how are you doing, I would recognize that big cock anywhere, have fun tonight buddy, guess who I met at happy hour, Debbie, we have been meeting up here and there and I am going to take her home tonight, so enjoy your evening, look she is right here” I could hear Debbie yell into the phone “Steve, babe, don’t wait up for me I am going to Linda’s to have some fun girl time” I was surprised that they had been seeing each other after our night together in the hotel, but I could tell they had a connection, and besides I can’t blame my wife for wanting to be with such an attractive woman. 

“Hey Linda, watch what Katie can do she really has a gift, go ahead Katie” Ashley motioned to my cock and Katie stopped rubbing me and started deep throating my cock like only she can, god it felt good as she bobbed up and down taking all of me every time. “Wow she is amazing” I could hear Linda yell into the phone “Well have fun ladies, talk to you tomorrow Ashley, you can give me all of the details” Linda added as she hung up. 

“Yan do you have anything to eat, watching her gobble down that cock is making me hungry” Courtney asked as the three of them walked out of the room leaving Katie and me alone. After another minute of Katie doing her amazing sword swallowing she decided to climb on top of me for another round of fucking. “You are so beautiful” I said to her as she rode my cock and she felt so good. Her fit little body and her long blonde hair was perfect and she was so cute and innocent looking, it made it so much hotter that she was so good at this. “God you feel so good in me Steve, I love your cock” She said as she slowly ground her clit against my body with me fully deep inside of her. I could feel her dripping pussy against me. “How about this view, you like my ass don’t you” Katie asked as she flipped around reverse cowgirl. “Your ass is perfect, it always gets me so hot when I see you walk through the office” The switch of position was doing it for her as she started to let out high pitched squeaks and she rode me faster and faster until she came one more time. She rolled around and laid on top of me and we kissed for a long time, my hard cock still sticking straight up she ground her pussy against my shaft as we kissed. It felt so good to feel all of her naked body pressed against me as we kissed. I wanted to hold her so bad. “Can you untie me, I want to feel you, your skin is so soft and you smell so good” I asked. “In a little bit, I will go ask the other girls” She rolled off of me and went in the other room, I stared at her perfect ass as it wiggled when she walked out the room. 

I laid there for about 10 minutes, still hard, the Viagra still working. I could hear moans of pleasure from the other room wondering what they were doing in there and finally Ashley walked in her big breasts swaying back and forth. “That Courtney sure is a wild one, I was just watching her eat Yan’s pussy, it got me all wet, you mind if I go for a ride” She said as she climbed on top of me, my thick cock easily sliding into her pussy. She sat on top of me and started rubbing her clit slowly grinding on top of me, her huge tits swaying back and forth.  “You like my tits Steve, you don’t think they are too big do you?” she asked as she kept riding my cock. “No, not at all, they look perfect on you, I really like them, they are just right not too firm and not too soft just perfect and I love your nipples” I replied now thrusting up into her harder. “Oh god, you are so sweet, yeah like that, that feels great” She replied as I kept pushing up into her. “Don’t stop, of fuck give it to me, oh fuck” she cried as she sped up her movements and her rubbing of her clit and she was now pulling on one of her nipples. “Fuck I am going to cum oh fuck!!!” she yelled and then fell on top of me. She felt so good with her huge breasts pressed against my body, she laid there for a moment my hard cock still inside of her. She then slid down so that my cock was between her tits, my wet dick slid up and down between her mounds which felt so good. “So you like my tits, do you like when I do this with them” she asked staring up at me. “Yes that is my favorite thing about them” I replied. “Well I will have to do this sometime when you haven’t cum yet and you can shoot a big load all over them, I love having cum on me, but that is all you get for now” Ashley released my cock and walked from the room. 

I was starting to get exhausted but my cock was still hard and Ashley’s tits made me feel like I was going to be able to cum again and now she was gone. I heard more screams of pleasure from the other room, this time I could tell it was Katie because of that high pitched squeak she lets out when she cums. After another few minutes I heard Ashley screaming Courtney’s name and it sounded like she was cuming. I laid there listening to every sound that I could, unable to leave but still hard and ready to be used some more. 

I then saw Courtney walk into the room, wiping the pussy juice from her chin and starting to look a little tipsy from the wine. She shut the door behind her and stood there naked in front of me, one hand on her pussy slowly rubbing herself the other stroking her breast and tugging on her nipple. “You think I am sexy” she asked. “As sexy as anyone I have ever met” I replied. “Well I don’t have as big of boobs as Ashley, and Katie has such a nice tight body and a great ass, and Yan is so exotic and has a nice firm body, I was hoping you still think I am sexy” she said in a quiet voice, blushing a little. “You are beautiful, your body is perfect, I love your legs and your breasts are perfect for your size, I could suck on those perky nipples of yours forever, your pussy is beautiful and tight and sweet and you ass is perfect for your body, I love watching you as you walk,you get me excited every time I see you” I meant every word I said this young girl gets me hot and she is insatiable. 

“I am glad you like me and in particular like my ass, I want you to do to me what you did before, I want you to fuck me in my little ass. She said as she leaned over to kiss me. She then untied my hands which was just what I wanted because I needed so bad to feel her soft skin. She walked to Yan’s dresser and took out a tube of lube and walked to the bed. “I left this here for Yan last night along with the handcuffs and blindfold, I thought she might need it to be able to take you and now I am glad I left it here.” She crawled up onto the bed and knelt on all fours sticking her little ass up in the air. She handed me the lube and I squirted a bunch on her tiny little ass hole and I rubbed a bunch on my cock. I positioned myself over her and slowly slid my cock into her tiny tight ass, driving it all of the way in. “Oh fuck that is better with the lube, give it to me, take my ass Steve, please take my ass” she cried. I began thrusting in and out of her, really enjoying my new found freedom. I tightly held her narrow hips and pounded into her ass, my balls slapping into her pussy with every thrust. Her face was pushed down hard into the bed as I forced all of my weight into her. She reached up and started rubbing her clit, enjoying every minute of me giving her what she asked for. The sensation of my big dick in her ass along with her stimulation made her cum. I could feel my orgasm building and I knew I was going to get some relief. “Where do you want my cum, I am going to explode” I asked. “I want to swallow it and cum on my face” she said, so I immediately stopped plowing into her ass and she turned and grabbed my cock stroked me a few times and stuck it in her mouth, not caring that it had to taste like her ass. “Oh fuck I am going to cum” I yelled and she released me from her mouth, I shot a full load all over her face giving her everything that was building up in me the past couple hours. She then licked my cock clean and took me by the hand and walked me out into the other room where the rest of the girls were. “Look what I made Steve do finally” Courtney said still with my cum all over her face. 

The other girls ran over to us and we all hugged together, it felt great to get my hands on them. Katie and Ashley kissed Courtney and licked the cum off of her face. Yan hugged me tight and rubbed my now softening cock. I kissed all of them and caressed their bodies, Ashley’s huge tits, Katie’s spectacular ass, Yan’s firm tits and ass and Courtney’s little ass and perky nipples. 

“So Steve, it looks like you have had enough for one night, Katie, Ashley and I are going to head out and get some dinner and more drinks, what do you say” Courtney said as she slid on her dress that she wore to work today and the other two started to dress. “Yan, what are you doing” I asked. “I am going to stay home and relax, I have some food here to eat and maybe watch a movie” Yan replied still naked curled up in a ball on the couch. “I don’t know if I am up to going out but I don’t have anywhere to be you mind if I join you” I asked. “That would be nice” she answered. 

“Well you two have fun we are heading out” Ashley answered and gave me a deep kiss. Courtney came over giving me a longer kiss while rubbing my cock and not to be outdone Katie kissed me even longer and then dropped to her knees and swallowed my cock and kissed the tip. “You are such a show off, come on lets leave these two alone” Courtney said as she grabbed Katie and headed towards the door. 

I joined Yan on the couch, leaned back and had her lay against me between my legs so her ass was right against my cock. I wrapped my arms around her, gently caressed her stomach and breasts and softly kissed her on the neck. We stayed like this on the couch for about a half an hour until the sensation of feeling her naked body against mine and our kissing had stirred my cock to awaken once again. I had just had more sex with more women than I could ever dreamed of in the past two days and I wanted more. Being here with this beautiful, petite young Asian girl was a true fantasy. We retired to the bedroom where I enjoyed her sweet tight pussy for the remainder of the night. We fell asleep in each others arms. In the morning we made love again and I finally left for home. Planning on a nice quiet weekend. Thankful for my good fortune.

3n98am,3,2015-10-02,"Early Character Concept [Ghoul Drug Fiend], looking for advice/rulings.",Twine52,Shadowrun,https://www.reddit.com/r/Shadowrun/comments/3n98am/early_character_concept_ghoul_drug_fiend_looking/,"Hey guys, I'm starting to outline a character I'm looking to build for use on the hub in the near future, was looking for some potential rulings on a few things, as well as critique in general.

**CONCEPT:**

There are a few core concepts I'm piecing together to make the character as a whole. First was that I want to try a character who uses/abuses drugs. This can be done via high addiction resist stats (WIL, LOG, and BOD), as well as an implanted Nephretic screen from CF. Second, I want to make an infected character, mostly because i haven't built one yet and they seem interesting, and I can tie in an interesting backstory hook, which I'll expand on below. Third, I found for this build and backstory that being awakened might be interesting as well, as there are some niche spells that I've never really seen used by regular folks that I could incorporate (namely, Detox and alleviate addiction).

**BACKSTORY** (WIP still, if that's not apparent): 

20-something college student, studying at a Seattle University. Major in Nursing, Minor in magic. Was working as an intern in a (shadow)clinic offering care for infected individuals when BAD THING happened and he got infected. Decided to embrace this new aspect of character instead of thinking of it as a life changing disaster.

ROLE: Ghouls tend to naturally fall into decent unarmed fighters, considering their natural claws. Adding, say Kamikaze to the mix will make a potent fighter with minimal investment above ghoul's bonuses (which ties into the story nicely, considering her career path before this was nursing/magic). On top of this, magic from the school of health will add some support capabilities, along with the other astral supporty stuff. 

**PRIORITIES:**

A: Attributes. Many attributes will be useful to have, so lacking too much anywhere could hurt.

B: Magic. Magic will want to be moderately good, and any lower would require karma investment to round out, which will end up tight later on.

C: Skills. Would like this higher, but C will have to do. Magic B helps since it adds 8 effective points.

D: Resources. A touch of wares will be used to round this character out.

E: Human. Gotta dump somewhere, and I'll admit this concept is already all over the place.

**ATTRIBUTES:**

Here's what I figured for an initial stat block (before improving with ghoul traits):

B5 |A4 |S3 |R2 |L3 |I5 |W6 |C3

WIL is prioritized first, both for resisting drain and addiction. BOD for addictions and combat capabilities. INT for drain resist (INT tradition chosen as ghouls get a bit of the shaft in CHA and LOG. A bit munchkiny, maybe, thought I'd argue that Chaos magic would be a good tradition, as she's only interested in what helps her patients first, so she doesn't care where the spells come from.) AGI and STR for combat effectiveness, which will be augmented with Ghoul stats.

**SKILLS:**

Unarmed combat: take the drugs, claw the dudes. Core to concept

Spellcasting (health): Helpful to concept and fits backstory.

First aid, medicine: Secondary/tertiary, as fitting to backstory.

Assensing/Perception: I love assensing, it's always good, and ghouls get some bonuses to nonstandard perceptions, which I'd like to take advantage of.

Intimidate: Drugged up ghoul? That's scary, right?

Etiquette: Probably going to get screwed in most social situations anyway, being a ghoul, but I'm thinking to at least mitigate that somewhat.

Sneaking: a little bit, most likely. Enough to get by. Might supplement with spells down the road.

Ranged combat skill: Haven't decided what to do here, yet, but probably something chemical based, to fit the background. DSMO sprayer with various goodies loaded in? Yes please.

**SPELLS:**

Detox and alleviate addiction to fit with drug theme. Heal and resist pain for more medical themed stuff. Everything else is up in the air for me at the moment. Suggestions?

**WARES:** 

Only thing I'm set on right now is the Nephretic screen. Need to look into more (I don't own CF presently, suggestions most welcome here), but they'd need to be on the budget end. I hear Orthoskin has a chemseal type upgrade? Caveat being that I'm only going with up to 1 Essence worth, as I don't want to impact my magic ability too much.

**DRUGS:**

Nitro and Kamikaze are probably going to be the go-tos, but I'll need to go over the new stuff from CF, too. Zen will be nice to have on hand as well.

**GEAR:**

Mostly chem based stuff: DSMO thrower, various types of gas grenades maybe. Chem resistance/gas masks. Medical equipment, of course.

-----

Now, I have two rulings issues that I'd like to go over:

* Detox: (SR5 288) ""Detox relieves the side effects of a drug or poison. The Force of the spell must equal or exceed the toxin’s base DV."" I'd primarily like to use this to alleviate the drug crash. However, drugs don't have a base DV to calculate at. How would you rule this? (as an aside, this spell seems janky in general. I need to cast a F15 spell to alleviate the disorientation caused by Neurostun? And then I only need one hit on my spellcasting test? Hardly a test at the 8 MAG required to cast the damn spell) 

* It mentions that Infected's bodies have a chance to reject/degrade their cyber/bioware that they currently have, but it seems to me this may not take effect in chargen? It states that, during chargen, you apply your infected-ness after step 4 of the chargen process, which is before the gear purchasing section.

-----

I'm going to attempt to wrangle chummer into cooperating and getting me a half decent sheet sometime soon. Wanted to see if you chums liked the concept and had any advice to share."
3n9cee,4,2015-10-02,"I [28/m] miss my friends to the point that it's given me anxiety attacks. I'm afraid I'm beginning to resent my wife for this, but it's not her fault. Not sure what to do. (long)",Venthorn,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/3n9cee/i_28m_miss_my_friends_to_the_point_that_its_given/,"This takes a while to get to both the point and the present, but I'm trying to present all details I think are relevant. I met my wife when we were both in college. We were college sweethearts and shared the same friend group. I am a very extroverted person and need lots of social interaction, though I did not always realize this.

I count graduating college (at 22) as the worst day of my life. I went on to a graduate school four hours away while my wife had another two years left. I struggled a lot during this period. I would come back every other weekend to visit her and my large friend group that was still there. When she graduated, we got married (I was 24 then) and she moved in with me in graduate school where we remained another two years until I graduated. These two years were really bad. I had difficulty making friends in graduate school due to the difference between undergrad/grad and it primarily being an undergraduate place. I was depressed a LOT. My one shining moment during this time was when I was an intern at a tech company in New York City, where I spent three and a half months. I worked hard, played online games with friends in the evenings and every weekend was doing something with my many college friends who had relocated to NYC after graduating.

After I graduated from grad school, I got a full-time position at the tech company with offers in both California and NYC. I believed at the time there was more opportunity in California and took that offer. I consider this to be the biggest mistake of my life and I don't know what I was thinking. We both found California (silicon valley) to be miserable and while we had a couple friends there that I met in graduate school, they eventually moved away and so did we after a year and a half.

That brings me to where we are today. We had both had a big desire to be homeowners and didn't like renting in CA. We talked about our options. She was, and remains, dead-set against living in NYC. I would absolutely love to live there, a fact that surprised me (I once thought I would hate it, until I had my internship there and had an amazing experience). We decided to compromise by purchasing a house about an hour and a half from the city, very close to where we both went to college and only two hours from her family who we love very much. We've now lived there for six months.

That's where we are now. I have been an absolute mess. It's a combination of factors. I'm dreading turning 30; I'm realizing that I spent a lot of my 20s chasing useless stuff like things, status, and certificate when I should have been focusing on what really matters (friends and family). And most of all, the big gaping hole in my heart, is that I miss my friends. My wife tries for me, she really does. We go out a lot on the weekends. We've visited her family a lot (I LOVE her family). We've gone to the city once, and had friends from the city come up on a couple occasions. It's just not enough for me, though. I need more...like, almost every weekend social get-togethers. But that's too much for her (she is introverted), and she wants some quiet weekends with me. Our events are also less spontaneous and more pre-planned due to the distance, which grates on me a bit.

I've wanted to make local friends that we could hang out with more, but that's proved very difficult because this is a small town. Even though I have always loved this town and this area I'm starting to go stir-crazy. I feel like there's this gaping hole in my heart that my friends used to fill. I'm feeling trapped by the decisions that led me to this point and most of all I'm afraid that I'm starting to resent her for the compromise that landed us here instead of in NYC, and the inability to go out and be social all the time. But I love my wife. We were college sweethearts and on most axes we are compatible, just not this. Resentment kills relationships and that's the last thing I want to feel towards her.

On a more psychiatric level, I did start on Lexapro soon after moving here when I started to get this feelings and broke down crying a lot. It helps most of the time, but sometimes I get triggered (recently by a silly story that had two BFFs that remained close for their lives) and things just snowball and I break down crying and a mess. That happened this week and that's why I'm trying, now, to get advice for figuring this out and working my way through it. I love my wife, and I need her in my life. But I also love my friends, and I need them in my life too. But I can't see a path to reconcile this.

edit with a few more details: I've tried meetup.com to meet some new people. There's a monthly meeting of tech workers from about an hour radius from a center point, which I fall in. I've gone twice, missed this month's (it was yesterday) because we had wanted to do our yearly Halloween shopping tradition. The meetups are very large and not very intimate, and I've had trouble ""converting"" people I've met there into friends. We are also not religious, and I feel like if I was I could join a church and meet a lot of my social needs that way. Other meetups tend to involve parenting of children (we don't have any, not sure if we want any). Also I work from home, so no friendships from the office :-(

tl;dr: Intense longing for active social life with good friends. Had that at one point in NYC. Moved to a small town (w/ house purchase) as a compromise with my wife. Limited social life, beginning to regret the move and afraid of resenting my wife for it. How do I reconcile my needs with hers?"
3n9g2k,2,2015-10-02,F4M- A little fuck toy,naughtygiirl,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3n9g2k/f4m_a_little_fuck_toy/,"Hello DPP I do like to discuss the scenarios and details before we start. So yeah the more original the better.

The first is a daddy/daughter, I don't mind going a bit dark on this one. Manipulation, Coercion, Grooming, Bimbofication, start it being noncon (it always moved to con though) are things I would interested to explore (her being bad and daddy has to punish her or the one daddy teaches her about reproduction are the most used in my experience and I'm bored of them).

I like to develop the story, before and after they have sex, so many times is develop and then after the sex is just sex sex sex, to me it gets boring and repetitive when this happens (I'm mainly interested in long term if clarification was needed)

The other one is different as I'm interested in a scenario where men just come and take me through out the day. It can be, I'm just a slut that likes to go around teasing older men and getting to have them fuck me no matter where, or I'm the intern at a company where my job is to be the office cum bucket.

 I can do first or third person.

As for length at least a paragraph is nice but I'm not picky or too special about that, mainly I work with what you give me and i understand sometimes you only manage to get three sentences and the next you write two paragraphs, as long is not just ""yeah, you want to fuck daddy"" and nothing else is cool. 

That said something i dislike a lot is when you write for me, a few actions that help the story flow, okay. But when you write what I say, reactions, what I feel, and do and worse a paragraph of that, I hate that. Once I can deal, the second time or if it's too bad I will drop it, sorry but I is a big pet peeve.

Main kinks; biting, choking, spanking, dirty talk, threesomes, nipple play, cum play, rough sex, sex in public places

I don't do, watersports, feces, blood, humiliation, torture, bestiality

Last but not least, if you're rude, pushy or is apparent you didn't read all that I wrote I won't want to continue or start."

I work with a staffing and recruiting company called HireNetworks. We pride ourselves on knowing our stuff and not just looking for candidates to ""fix this website"" or ""write a javascript"". At the moment I am looking for a technical writer with at least 2-5 years of experience who is looking for a full-time, direct hire job. Coursework and internships with a portfolio can be considered as experience for grads.

3nad9a,4,2015-10-02,I [19M] have a huge crush on my coworker [21F] but I'm afraid I'll ruin our friendship.,ConfusedLover23,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3nad9a/i_19m_have_a_huge_crush_on_my_coworker_21f_but_im/,"So I started my very first job after first year of college. I worked at a car rental company. There I met this girl who is two years older then me and was working as a paid intern at the company.

At first I was very shy around her, unfortunately I never made much friends during my first college year and I had become very shy. Luckily this job which deals with a lot of customers has boosted my confidence and has allowed me to become more openly active with people. My coworker who was the same age as her was good friends with her, I became good friends with him.

Despite my shyness, after working with her for a couple of weeks, I became more open to conversation with her, mostly work related but sometimes off topic as well. 

Throughout my second month with her, we were together most of the time at our workplace somedays, she dealt with the customers while I dealt with cars being returned by rent. There was a good 3-4 hours where the place would be dead and it gave us time to talk with each other, it was then when I learned a lot more about her and how we had liked similar things such as tv shows, musicians, sports and celebrities. It was then I had felt something.

Third month in, I couldn't go a day at work without at least seeing her once, we operated at two different branches so when she was at one branch, I'd try to make any excuse to my managers just so that they can send me over to where she works. We would chat any time we met at work and it was then I realized I really liked this girl. Never in my life did I have a crush on a girl as big as this one. 

Fourth month in, the month of August would seem like our last month seeing each other, she planned on quitting when school started which made me more sad as each week went by. On the final day I was with her for a few hours at the branch until she left for the other branch, to which I had received great news that she had planned to stay until the end of her first semester (Sept-Dec) I was ecstatic and told the news to my friends. 

By the beginning of September, our friendship was strong, she began messaging me on Whatsapp to which I was in delight as it allowed me to chat with her at any time. 

Despite me still having a crush on her, I never knew if she had the same feeling for me as well. That all changed for me when I forgot to take my phone, when I went back to get it, she took a selfie of herself and posted it on my snapchat story without telling me. To which I was incredibly excited by! I then questioned it a few days later and she was just laughing about it. 

By the end of second week of September, we followed each other on other social media platforms. Unfortunately because of school (We both commute to schools, different ones though) I only managed to see her once a week which would be every Friday and only for a few hours as she would leave by the afternoon for school. 

Now last Friday, our friendship became more personal, we both went more in-depth in our dating lives. She asked if I had ever dated someone, to which I answered no, I was too shy. She laughs and I ask the same thing and in which she replies nothing serious just a small fling in High school that only lasted a month and I only went out with him because he had a huge crush on me. We talked about love as well and how I was more into romantic films (non-american ones, we're both south Asian) to which she also watched as well. 

This week I managed to see her on Tuesday afternoon, her only other day that she works aside from Friday. I would come in the afternoon because my coworker was sick and luckily it was only me and her working together, in which she messaged me on Whatsapp ""You and meee today"" I was in delight. We both chatted away, about work, school, movies, and all that kind of stuff. I would go home happy to see her again.

Unfortunately today, Friday Oct 2nd. Things took a turn for the worst, our nearby branches had managers changing places due to promotions and people quitting, because of this we received a new Manager trainee and because so, she was traded to another branch with another of my co-workers.

When I got the news I was in shock, like a train just hit me, I would tell her how I'm going to be so sad that she's leaving and to which she also said the same thing. I was in a depressed mood and I desperately asked my manager to trade me instead to the same branch instead of my co-worker to which his answer was no.

I messaged her on Whatsapp after she went home and I would tell her how I would miss her at work and and how I will still message her regardless to see how she's doing. To which she replied that I must message her at least every week and always keep her in the loop of what's going on at our branch. I felt a bit better after that.

Clearly I love this girl, and I don't think that our age matters considering we're both adults and me and her basically have a lot of things in common. But I want to really take it to the next level, and I want to do that by hanging out with her once the semester is over in December. 

Every time I look into her eyes, we lock in and we smile during a conversation, I try not to do it as often to make it not awkward.

   
**tl;dr**: Met coworker, started out as me being good friends with her, I fell in love, I don't know if she sees it that way as well.

Should I just keep messaging her every week and continue until the end of first semester?

How do I approach her about me liking her?

I want to catch up with her after first semester, should I go to a movie with her, or to a restaurant?

If I do either, is it a good idea to bring my coworker who is also good friends with her and have him bring his GF along as well?

Any advice would help! Thanks!"

I found an interesting internship that’ll pay me $1,600 while learning the business and possibly opening one myself in the future (4-5 years).

Right now, I owe $46,000 with an average interest rate of 5%. I decided that I want to go with Pay As You Earn (PAYE) plan as it gives me the most choices. Based on what I’ve researched so far, it seems that I have two options. 

1.) Make more than the minimum payment due each month and try to pay off all my loans as soon as possible or 2.) Make only the minimum payments which would total at about $19,202 [ I used the payment estimator off StudentLoans.gov, which assumes that my income of $19,200 will grow 5% per year]

I have also really been struck by r/financialindependence and it seems to me that using option 2, I can start putting away money into an IRA or Index Fund (after I make an emergency fund). On the other hand, option 1 could be better because my income might go up and then I could pay off my loans quicker.

I’m just feeling a bit tired reading all this stuff, but does this seem right to you? Both these choices seem incredibly difficult right now because I don’t know what I’ll be doing in the future. I might decide to go back to grad school and teach (I know the job market is terrible for that) or continue with the business and hopefully make enough to pay off my loans. Any help would be much appreciated!

I am originally from Europe; my wife and I moved to Phoenix, AZ 3 years ago. We started everything basically from scratch, including jobs that we did not have much background in. I enjoy my current job but I don't see myself doing the same thing when I'm 50, so I gotta change something while I can.
I have an electrical engineering degree (power generation/transport/distribution) but I have not worked in this field in the past decade. Nor do I have a real passion for it. The way I see it, this new start in life is an opportunity for a career change.

My passion has always been coding, even going back to highscool. The languages I used years back are not used anymore. So I recently started learning programming in C# and the .NET framework, on some of the online tutorials (MVA, wibit.com, learnvisualstudio.net). I totally love it. I am only at the beginning of this road but I want to get my first job as a software developer before I turn 40.

I am not sure how things work in the US job market, so I need some advice on taking the best route to reaching my goal.

Here is my dilemma. Should I go back into school to get my masters in ""computer science"" or ""software engineer"" (or whatever names they have in US)? Is that worth the time and money? Should I invest into getting any Microsoft .NET certifications? Having no real coding experience, would enrolling into some internship for a software company work? Any ideas might help. In the meantime I will keep on learning C# and eventually get into Java. Thanks guys.

3nbkyg,0,2015-10-03,questions about feminism,askinquestionsnow,AskFeminists,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/3nbkyg/questions_about_feminism/,"I'm a 31 year old dude who doesn't know much about feminism -- I see a lot of stuff related to feminism on the Internet these days, but I'm not sure what I'm even seeing. So I'm coming here with as much of an open mind as I possibly can, and just trying to ask some questions -- I'm not trying to offend anyone with these questions, I truly am just trying to learn.

My questions are as follows:

1) It seems like feminism is a remarkably consistent ideology: i.e. it simply asserts that women deserve the same rights and respect as men. From the outside looking in, it seems like feminism is refreshingly non-hypocritical compared to most political movements. There is one aspect that strikes me as somewhat hypocritical though: men who prefer to date or marry a woman with a low partner count are considered ""slut shamers,"" and their behavior is considered bad. Now, I've always thought there should be a general policy of ""all is fair in love and war"" when it comes to romantic relationships. By that measure, women should feel free to choose not to date a man because of his height, and men should also feel free to choose not to date a woman because of her past. If anything, men have less control over their height than women have over their number of sexual partners (barring extreme negative circumstances such as rape)-- so philosophically speaking, isn't it almost ""less judgmental"" when men dismiss a woman based on her sexual past, than when women dismiss a man based on his height? I mean, judging a woman based on her sexual past is pretty ridiculous (just as judging a man based on height is ridiculous), but it seems there shouldn't be any outcry over it.. unless I'm mistaken? Once again, I'm not trying to be offensive here -- this is a legitimate question that I would like answered, and as I mentioned, aside from this, I find feminism remarkably unhypocritical.

2) It seems like feminist ideas often take root on college campuses, as well they should, since that's where learning and expanding one's horizons ought to take place (unless you're an idiot like me who just spends all his time in college in the computer lab). Let's say I'm a typical heterosexual 19 year old guy in college (in reality I'm bi, but for the sake of argument let's say I'm hetero). Let's say I'm single, and like most healthy 19 year old dudes, my hormones are in full swing and I'm horny all the time. Feminism seems to say (and once again -- I'm not fully aware of what feminism is so I may be way off base and wrong here) that I'm not owed a girlfriend, that pick-up artist types who encourage men to see women as objects and manipulate women are assholes, and that feminism helps men too. That's all well and good, but it doesn't change the fact that as a horny 19 year old dude, I'm popping boners every time I walk between classes. It doesn't change the fact that all I seem to be able to think about is girls and sex. And I'm not thinking about girls and sex all the time because I actively want to objectify women, or because of the patriarchy or because my definitions of masculinity involve lots of women -- I'm simply thinking about girls and sex all the time because I'm a 19 year old dude and that's what my hormones are commanding me to do. If that 19 year old dude overhears some rhetoric about how women are not objects, or about women's equality, or the need for more women in tech, etc.. he's not really going to object to it. He's not going to really give a crap about it either way. Mostly he's just thinking about his boners... because let's face it, he's 19. Or at least, that's how I was when I was 19. So.. how does feminism reach somebody like that, or gain the support and understanding of somebody like that? How do you go about preaching about the evils of the patriarchy to somebody (like my younger 19 year old self) who, due to teenage hormones, literally doesn't have much on his mind aside from girls and sex? I'm not trying to be crass (I apologize if I come across that way) but it seems to me like answering this question, would provide a way to get a lot more young men on board with feminism, or at least can help show you why young men might be ambivalent about feminism?

A bit of background about me: I worked really hard when I was young (college and right out of school), to the exclusion of all else (to the extent that I remember seeing Take Back the Night rallies on campus but not knowing what they were about until last year -- I was literally so busy running between classes, an internship, and running my own business that I didn't have time to pay attention). Ended up doing decently well career wise at a young age, and proceeded to spend most of my time living a bit of a playboy lifestyle, traveling the world surfing and having fun for a few years. So when I say I don't know much about feminism, I truly don't know anything -- my life's just been focused on work and then fun / travel up until now, when I'm finally starting to look around and see what's happening in the world of politics, etc."
3nbw9i,2,2015-10-03,I can't forgive people,chainguncassidy,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3nbw9i/i_cant_forgive_people/,"I'm very quick to place people on my bad list, no matter how small what people do do to me, if it's negative I'll hate them and wish horrible things on them.

My latest enemies are a charity I wanted to intern at, they wanted someone to come in and volunteer for a year to help them with their human resources process, I called and had a half an hour talk detailing why this would be the perfect opportunity for me, I'm trying to change careers and no one is responding my applications for paid work (More fodder for my hate) I thought this was perfect, I'd get experience and a solid reference .
I told them why I needed it but nope.

I got an email from them two days ago with the usual insulting message I always get when applying ""Sorry you're not good enough, but thanks and good luck LOL!"" I'm obviously exaggerating but that's what I felt after reading it.

I am deeply hurt by this, here was the perfect opportunity to actually start a career and it's been cruelly taken from me, I'm at my wits end, this has to stop, if something doesn't happen soon I'll end up with too big a hole in my resume and I'll end up homeless, very ironic for a third world micro loan charity to do to someone.

As you probably can pick up I'm very angry about this and I can't stop hating people for these things, I've deleted so many response emails to the rejection letter ranging from ""Go die"" to practically begging them to reconsider, this keeps happening, anyone that does anything bad to me I just wish the most vile things on and sometimes picture doing them to myself, I don't want to be this hateful mess anymore, this is really worrying me.

How do you forgive people and move on?"

Regardless I realize that I need to get a job and start paying down my loans. My goal is to be financially independent so that I can pursue what I really love doing- reading and writing. 

I found an interesting internship that’ll pay me $2,000 a month while learning the business and possibly opening one myself in the future (4-5 years).

Right now, my student loans are $46,000 with an average interest rate of 5%. I decided that I want to go with Pay As You Earn (PAYE) plan as it allows me to make monthly payments at 10% of my income. PAYE gives me the option of making the bare minimum payments for 20 years and then whatever is left over is forgiven. 
Based on what I’ve researched so far, it seems that I have two options.

1.) Make more than the minimum payment due each month and try to pay off all my loans as soon as possible [If I make an average of $485 monthly payment it will cost me $58,310 in 10 years] or 2.) Make only the minimum payments which would total at about $22,000 [ I used the payment estimator off StudentLoans.gov, which assumes that my income of $20,000 will grow 5% per year]

Some information about my own expenses:

-Credit Card Debt= $0 (just paid off)

-Emergency Fund= $0 (I will start saving for this ASAP)

-Savings= $50 

-Rent= $0; my room is free- I live in a trailer parked on the property

-Groceries= $300

-Gas= $60

-Entertainment= I like to hike ($20 for gas) and read ($20)

That leaves me with about $1,600 

I have also really been struck by r/financialindependence and it seems to me that using option 2, I can start putting away money into an IRA or Index Fund (after I make an emergency fund). On the other hand, option 1 could be better because my income might go up and I could pay off my loan allowing me to do what I want sooner. 

Both these choices seem incredibly difficult right now because I don’t know what I’ll be doing in the future. I might decide to earn a PhD and teach (I know the job market is terrible for that) or continue with the business and hopefully make enough to pay off my loans. I think both options have their advantages and would appreciate any help!

3ndrnq,6,2015-10-03,About Unis,Zarqu0n,SeriousConversation,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeriousConversation/comments/3ndrnq/about_unis/,"I wrote a really long post but decided to write a short version because who would read such a long post. 

To start off: I'm very privileged. I got the chance to finish high school and get the chance to get into tertiary education. So thinking about these ""problems"" sometimes makes me feel like a spoiled brat. I will start going to Uni on Monday, studying computer science. Although it does pay well, I have started to doubt that this is something I want to pursue a career in. I don't like the idea of sitting in an office all day when there are far more interesting jobs? I'd be interested in Zoology or Marine Biology but nothing specific yet. I did an internship at a marine research institute and really liked it. But I'm afraid those majors aren't very praxis oriented here in Germany, which also brings me to my next topic. For a long time now I dreamed of studying abroad. For example New Zealand, when I was there I absolutely had a blast and it felt like it's a great country to live in. But especially with a degree like the 2 above it would be financial suicide, I'm afraid. 

When looking for alternatives Scotland seemed interesting because it's really cheap compared to other english speaking countries. I don't like bragging especially not about a topic like this, but I got a *Abitur* score well above average (although I was expecting more considering how much I studied) and skipped school years 1 and 8 because I was *good enough*.  Now looking through the likes of Glasgow and Edinbourgh, I was really disappointed that my grades in high school weren't good enough. 

Now I don't know what to do. I'm 17 years old. Just studying computer science for 3 years and then starting to work at 20 seems so dull and boring, even with a year of work and travel or so. And studying abroad would be awesome too. I think I would prefer living in a dorm over living home, alone. Does anyone have any ideas or feel the same regarding these topics? Does anyone have an idea what I could do? I luckily still have some time."

3neisg,5,2015-10-03,Worth it at this point to get my CPA?,vipereo,CPA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPA/comments/3neisg/worth_it_at_this_point_to_get_my_cpa/,"Hello all,

I'm debating at this point whether or not to get my CPA license, could really use some input. I graduated from UCF in Orlando about 3.5 years ago with my Masters in Accounting and immediately got a position as a Budget Analyst at a local municipality. I never ended up getting my CPA while I was finishing school because frankly, I was pretty lazy and when I got the Budget Analyst position I really did enjoy it. Also, I was not really ready at that time in my life to be a professional dealing with clients and just being a normal staff accountant sounded boring.

I was never really worried about getting my CPA because I thought I would stay in government forever and the CPA wasn't really relevant. Over the last year or so I've kind of changed my mind, and could really use input from others. I’ve learned a lot over the last few years and am much more confident in my desire and ability to be able to deal with clients.

Recently (like last week) I was promoted to a Fiscal Manager position at my same employer and make approximately $64k a year. I’m excited about my new position and am not in a rush to leave a good career at only 28. In addition, there’s a chance (but not even remotely guaranteed) that I could be promoted to my supervisors position in 2-3 years or so and make $80k or so a year. I could see myself doing this long term BUT then I would never ever be able to get my CPA. In Florida, there is a requirement to work directly under a CPA for one year in order to be a licensed CPA and this career path would never let me get that experience, nor would I be able to work part time to get it either.

The way I'm thinking of it, the minor costs are:

1. Up to one to two year pay cut compared to the $64k I make now,

2. $2000 to take Wiley prep course

3. $1500 to take all of the tests

4. Time to study for the tests

Compared to benefits of:

1. Average 10% extra annual earnings over the rest of my career. 

2. Advantage in hiring for any business-related position in the future, reducing possible downtime if laid off

3. Opportunity to start my own firm down the road if I stick to auditing/attestation/consulting
 
On top of those points I must admit on a personal level: 

1. I want the prestige of being a licensed professional.

2. I feel like it's something I'm completely capable of and will always regret it if I don't do it.

I plan on studying for the CPA Exam starting Dec. and taking a year to finish all four sections.

My major questions are:

1.	Can I get into a Big Four firm immediately after finishing all four parts of the CPA exam? Or am I too late because I didn’t get an internship when I graduated? Will my work experience possibly assist me in getting a position or is it detrimental?

2.	What would I be paid starting at a big four firm? Would it be a substantial pay cut?
 
3.	Another separate long-term goal of mine is to move to Washington DC within two years. Should I apply for CPA licensure in both Florida and DC at the same time?

4.	How long does it take to become a manager at a major big four firm? My plan would be to work to that (2-3 years?) and then look at other opportunities externally.

Thanks so much for any help you can offer me. Sorry about the massive amounts of text.

3nekpr,22,2015-10-03,Race Report: 2015 Watonga Invitiational 5k,chickenwithcheez,AdvancedRunning,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/3nekpr/race_report_2015_watonga_invitiational_5k/,"Hey all! I would normally put this report in the workout thread but this was an eventful race and I'm really excited so I thought I would just give it it's own post. 

Pre-race: Got up at 5:45 and just popped out of bed. Felt super rested. Had breakfast and all that jazz, then headed over to the high school to get in the van to the meet at around 6:45. We got there at about 8:10 I think, and shortly got out and warmed up, because we ran at 9. It was about 50 degrees, so I got in a longer warmup then I usually would of about 1.7 miles on the course, then put on my stuff and went to the line.

The Course: The course is a small loop and a big loop. The first small loop takes you to like 1.1 miles so the next loop is 2 miles. The course has a few ups and downs but nothing major, and whatever you go up is made for in down. The course has some bad footing made of sand and hard dirt and a few sharp turns, but it is actually not a super slow course because it has lots of long straights. 

The Race: All season my coach has told me to get out hard in a race so today I did and was in the top 20 almost immediately. This meet didn't have seperate JV and varsity races, so it was packed. All my teammates started out crazy hard the 1200, but I caught them fairly quick. First mile in 5:41, and my rival from track came into sight. I caught him right at the beginning of the second loop, and we both muttered good job. Caught my teammate right after that, and that put me in 4th place among my team and around 8th in the race, I think. I saw the teammate who usually beats the crap out of me at the top of a hill, and I decided to go for him. Slowly made up the ground and found out there was a pack of 3 of my teammates and two kids from other schools. Once I showed up, the pack dispersed quickly. A teammate and one of the other guys fell back, and then another teammate shortly after. It was me, the teammate who beats me, and this other guy who also usually beats the tar out of me. Right before the 2 mile mark, my teammate dropped back and the other guy was still about 15-20m ahead. Right at two miles, which crossed in 5:45, I really decided to go for him and turned it on. He came to me really quickly, but I couldn't pass him. His coach showed up at some point and told us we had about 800 to go. The other thing my coach has told me all season is I need to have a long kick. I decided to make a long drive for home and I passed this guy, but couldn't shake him. At  this point, it is probably worth mentioning that this whole time I thought I was competing for the win. Anyways, this goes on for another 500m and my coach shows up and tells me, ""300 to go you gotta go now!"" so I really went for it. I dropped him like a rock right then, and was all on my own coming into the final straight. The third mile was in 5:32, and I didn't have long to go. I had one last gear and I used it. Felt like I was flying into the finish. Walked through the chute to get my place-card, and it said ""2."" I discovered that 1st place beat me by 40 seconds. I was still pumped. The guy behind me had really turned it on the last 100 and I only beat him by 3 seconds. Final time was 17:46, which is a PR by 1 second. 

Post race: I jogged my cooldown and didn't even feel all that tired. I think I was super high on adrenaline because I crashed hard about an hour and a half later. Still super pumped though. My team got 2nd at the meet, and I went home, napped, and saw The Intern, which is a great movie. 

Thanks for reading! "

3nfgav,0,2015-10-04,RTFM,HackerPlantation,freethinkers,https://www.reddit.com/r/freethinkers/comments/3nfgav/rtfm/,"In 1995, only 5 years before the dot-com bubble of 2000 was about to burst, two English
media theorists, Richard Barbook and Andy Cameron, wrote an essay titled The Californian
Ideology. In it, they posited that an odd mixture of seemingly antithetical Left- and Right-Wing
ideologies combined to form an entirely new breed of bourgeoisie, an ideological fusion most
famously associated with Silicon Valley in the United States.



“This new faith has emerged from a bizarre fusion of the cultural bohemianism of San
Francisco with the hi-tech industries of Silicon Valley. Promoted in magazines, books, tv-
programmes, Web sites, newsgroups and Net conferences, the Californian Ideology promiscuously
combines the free-wheeling spirit of the hippies and the entrepreneurial zeal of the yuppies. [1]”



Five years later, in 2000, cultural commentator David Brooks published a book titled Bobos
in Paradise, perhaps refining the earlier critiques of Barbook and Cameron.



“But I returned to an America in which the bohemian and the bourgeois were all mixed up. It
was now impossible to tell an espresso-sipping artist from a cappuccino-gulping banker. And this
wasn't just a matter of fashion accessories. I found that if you investigated people's attitudes toward
sex, morality, leisure time, and work, it was getting harder and harder to separate the anti-
establishment renegade from the pro-establishment company man. Most people, at least among the
college-educated set, seemed to have rebel attitudes and social-climbing attitudes all scrambled
together. Defying expectations and maybe logic, people seemed to have combined the counter-
cultural sixties and the achieving eighties into one social ethos. [2]”



In the year 2015, it is difficult to understate both the presence and consequences of the
aforementioned. “Diversity Gap” and “Digital Divide” are terms that are used and abused, not only
in America, not only in the American media industries but especially in Silicon Valley, America's
current bastion of affluence and capital. Many social, political, and economic forces combined to
form what we now know as Intel, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, Yahoo, etc. It is perhaps
quite ironic and paradoxical, then, that the same institutions that find it remotely possible to
complain about a “Talent Crunch” have, at best, a tongue-in-cheek approach to fixing the Diversity
Gap and Digital Divide and, at worst, turn a blind eye to it as evidenced by their exploitative
workforce demographics and workplace policies. The chances that the exact same robber baron
capitalists who offer naive college interns stock options at start-up companies that have little
chances of generating actual revenue due to completely ignorant, short-sighted, naive business plans
and stratagem, are also concerned with the welfare of poor, working class American minorities are
highly unlikely.



Throughout much of history, episodes of monarchy, imperialism, capitalism, oppression, and
their follies have made for some of the best art; essays, books, and movies. After all, art imitates
life. Some films like The Social Network are starting to catch on and capture the zeitgeist. It is
absolutely acceptable that poor, working class minorities, however they choose to identify
themselves, do the best they can to understand exactly what is going on in Silicon Valley today.
What is absolutely unacceptable, however, is for the “melting pot” of America to revert back to the
Plantation Politics that occurred during the horrors of imperialism, colonization, and slavery,
especially as evidenced by Africa, Latin America, the Arab world, and probably many other
homogeneous “cultures”.



These are valid propositions, and for proof one needs only to turn to the French Revolution,
where race and identity politics were perhaps a bit muted, considering it was probably a relatively
homogeneous society of French people. Free from the burden of racial identity politics, the French
Revolution allowed the ideological distillation of Left and Right to fully develop and mature into a
more refined definition of present-day First, Second, and Third Estates.



Modern day oppression has no race, no culture, no identity other than capitalism itself.
Modern day capitalism is united under one banner today more than it has ever been. Western
Civilization has had quite some time to refine its techniques and its modus operandi. It realizes that
internecine strife along the same genetic bloodline is a business opportunity not to overlook, like a
virus. A multi-racial, multi-ethnic, world-wide, working-class labor union is probably capitalism's
worst nightmare. Plantation Politics and identity politics are probably capitalists' wet dream.



There's nothing better than the “tribal elders” or Uncle Toms of the world's ancient cultures
and societies voluntarily providing cheap, free, or slave labor to capitalism, as its proponents don't
have to take any direct responsibility for this. There's nothing better for capitalism than to hide in
plain sight and pretend to be a heterogeneous group. It is otherwise difficult or impossible to lay
claim to equality, liberty, egalitarianism, and other positive virtues if you're not actually all-
inclusive. However, the Western world, the Anglo-phonic world has, in fact, turned into a very
homogeneous First, Second, and Third Estate. It is bona fide classism, just like it existed during the
French Revolution, this time with no Plantation Politics or identity politics to cause internal
confusion and division among the First and Second Estates. Unfortunately, the Third Estate
sometimes has trouble uniting itself in the same way.



Technology, then, is also the capitalist class' greatest endeavor realized. Now that capitalism
has “poisoned the well” for all races and ethnicities, it can now unite itself under one banner,
without regards to race or ethnicity, while the Third Estate scrambles, sometimes hopelessly, to
form a cohesive group itself due to various conflicts of interest.



“The drift towards the right by the Californian ideologues is then helped by their
unquestioning acceptance of the liberal ideal of the self-sufficient individual. In American folklore,
the nation was built out of a wilderness by free-booting individuals - the trappers, cowboys,
preachers, and settlers of the frontier. The American revolution itself was fought to protect the
freedoms and property of individuals against oppressive laws and unjust taxes imposed by a foreign
monarch. For both the New Left and the New Right, the early years of the American republic
provide a potent model for their rival versions of individual freedom. Yet there is a profound
contradiction at the centre of this primordial American dream: individuals in this period only
prospered through the suffering of others. Nowhere is this clearer than in the life of Thomas
Jefferson - the chief icon of the Californian Ideology. Thomas Jefferson was the man who wrote the
inspiring call for democracy and liberty in the American Declaration of Independence and - at the
same time - owned nearly 200 human beings as slaves. As a politician, he championed the right of
American farmers and artisans to determine their own destinies without being subject to the
restrictions of feudal Europe. Like other liberals of the period, he thought that political liberties
could be protected from authoritarian governments only by the widespread ownership of individual
private property. The rights of citizens were derived from this fundamental natural right. In order to
encourage self- sufficiency, he proposed that every American should be given at least 50 acres of
land to guarantee their economic independence. Yet, while idealising the small farmers and
businessmen of the frontier, Jefferson was actually a Virginian plantation-owner living off the
labour of his slaves. Although the South's 'peculiar institution' troubled his conscience, he still
believed that the natural rights of man included the right to own human beings as private property.
In 'Jeffersonian democracy', freedom for white folks was based upon slavery for black people. [1]”



Here, the inherent, systemic flaws of Silicon Valley are quite apparent. It is no surprise that
at such a company as Amazon, the corporate culture has been identified as toxic and hostile to its
own workers, both at lower as well as higher ranks. One of the words Silicon Valley likes to throw
around a lot is the word “disruptive”. Let us examine, then, exactly how disruptive Silicon Valley
can be.“Despite the eventual emancipation of the slaves and the victories of the civil rights
movement, racial segregation still lies at the centre of American politics - especially on the West
Coast. In the 1994 election for governor in California, Pete Wilson, the Republican candidate, won
through a vicious anti-immigrant campaign. Nationally, the triumph of Gingrich's Republican party
in the legislative elections was based on the mobilisation of 'angry white males' against the
supposed threat from black welfare scroungers, immigrants from Mexico and other uppity
minorities. These politicians have reaped the electoral benefits of the increasing polarisation
between the mainly white, affluent suburbanites - most of whom vote - and the largely non-white,
poorer inner city dwellers - most of whom don't vote. [1]”



It might be more accurate to say that Silicon Valley lives a double life and by double-
standards. Clearly, disruption is beneficial to modern capitalism, but in which ways exactly does it
desire disruption? Disruption to workers' rights, human rights, and civil liberties?



“Although they retain some hippie ideals, many Californian ideologues have found it
impossible to take a clear stand against the divisive policies of the Republicans. This is because the
hi-tech and media industries are a key element of the New Right electoral coalition. In part, both
capitalists and well- paid workers fear that the open acknowledgement of public funding of their
companies would justify tax rises to pay for desperately needed spending on health care,
environmental protection, housing, public transport and education. More importantly, many
members of the 'virtual class' want to be seduced by the libertarian rhetoric and technological
enthusiasm of the New Right. Working for hi-tech and media companies, they would like to believe
that the electronic marketplace can somehow solve America's pressing social and economic
problems without any sacrifices on their part. [1]”



It is actually quite easy to claim to be for the working man and supportive of civil rights if
you are a multi-billion dollar corporation. However, many of society's pressing matters cannot be
solved by simply having money thrown at them. Let us examine how a new “Internet Apartheid”
has taken root at the hands of the capitalist class.



“In the USA, a major redistribution of wealth is urgently needed in the long-term economic
well-being of the majority of the population. However, this is against the short-term interests of rich
white folks, including many members of the 'virtual class'. Rather than share with their poor black
or hispanic neighbours, the yuppies instead retreat into their affluent suburbs, protected by armed
guards and secure with their private welfare services. The deprived only participate in the
information age by providing cheap non-unionised labour for the unhealthy factories of the Silicon
Valley chip manufacturers. Even the construction of cyberspace could become an integral part of
the fragmentation of American society into antagonistic, racially-determined classes.”



The capitalist class has no problem with the proletariat consuming technology, because it
translates into profit margins. Problems only arise when these same proletariats attempt to produce
technology, when capitalist profits must be shared, especially with those who bring nothing to the
table in return. Meanwhile, the capitalist class claims to be assuming responsibility for the
resolution of Internet Apartheid, Digital Divide, and the Diversity Gap while simultaneously
reinforcing them.



“Already 'red-lined' by profit-hungry telephone companies, the inhabitants of poor inner city
areas are now threatened with exclusion from the new on-line services through lack of money. In
contrast, members of the 'virtual class' and other professionals can play at being cyberpunks within
hyper-reality without having to meet any of their impoverished neighbours. Alongside the ever-
widening social divisions, another apartheid is being created between the 'information-rich' and 
the'information-poor'. In this hi-tech 'Jeffersonian democracy', the relationship between masters and
slaves endures in a new form. [1]”



In this sense it is now possible for the capitalist class to claim to be contributing to
humanitarian causes while behaving almost completely contradictory to them. The TV show Silicon
Valley by Mike Judge highlights this extremely well. These Techno-Capitalists claim to be “making
the world a better place”, while they couldn't be any more disconnected from actual poor, working
class American minorities. They will, however, go out of their way to ensure relaxed governmental
regulations that most benefit their businesses, whether it be by circumventing legislation designed
to protect consumers and workers, or by lobbying Congress to pass legislation beneficial to their
supply or production chains at a high cost to their own consumers or workers. They want a
“smaller” government because a small government cannot stop them from renewing or increasing
the power they already have.



Again, bear in mind that it is this same group of people claiming there is a Talent Crunch in
lieu of also acknowledging the Digital Divide and the Diversity Gap. It is hard to imagine that there
is little that this enriched, elitist, capitalist class can do to alleviate these societal problems if they
can manage to consolidate their power so effectively. Their rhetoric, with minimal deconstruction,
quickly reveals the depths of their hypocrisy. It is quite an effective way of reinforcing power
structures of the past. “Democracy” was the exact same thing promised by Latin American warlords
who came to power using violent force, threatening to “disappear” political dissidents as they
themselves were receiving monetary and political assistance from third parties with their own
agendas.



“The fear of the rebellious 'underclass' has now corrupted the most fundamental tenet of the
Californian Ideology: its belief in the emancipatory potentiality of the new information
technologies. While the proponents of the electronic agora and the electronic marketplace promise
to liberate individuals from the hierarchies of the state and private monopolies, the social
polarisation of American society is bringing forth a more oppressive vision of the digital future. The
technologies of freedom are turning into the machines of dominance. At his estate at Monticello,
Jefferson invented many clever gadgets for his house, such as a 'dumb waiter' to deliver food from
the kitchen into the dining room. By mediating his contacts with his slaves through technology, this
revolutionary individualist spared himself from facing the reality of his dependence upon the forced
labour of his fellow human beings. In the late-twentieth century, technology is once again being
used to reinforce the difference between the masters and the slaves. [1]”



Here we see Thomas Jefferson behaving like many other “entrepreneurs” and “venture
capitalists”, claiming to be revolutionary while pretty much reinforcing the status quo. In many
cities in the US, much is done to hide the fact that a disproportionate amount of undocumented
Latino workers prepare dishes in many Zagat-Rated restaurants. These workers only cook the food,
they don't serve it like waiters and waitresses do. That would be too much of a smack in the face
from reality for the patrons of these restaurants. This is very similar to when a company like Dell
offshores it's own customers' phone support to Asia, or how American technology workers in
general are disproportionately Asian males, in spite of excellent academic performance from other
minority groups, especially females. Apparently, certain minorities are only fit for certain roles in
American society, and Americans only have so much tolerance for this that they must keep it hidden
from view.



“While the hippies saw self- development as part of social liberation, the hi-tech artisans of
contemporary California are more likely to seek individual self- fulfillment through therapy,
spiritualism, exercise or other narcissistic pursuits. Their desire to escape into the gated suburb of
the hyper-real is only one aspect of this deep self-obsession... Instead of predicting the emancipation 
of humanity, this form of technological determinism can only envisage a deepening of
social segregation. [1]”



It is interesting to note that the capitalist class is not completely ignorant of its own
hypocrisy. There is perhaps some racism inherent, then, in technological research and development,
insofar as it enables the capitalist class to not have to face the consequences of their own actions.



“Despite these fantasies, white people in California remain dependent on their darker-
skinned fellow humans to work in their factories, pick their crops, look after their children and tend
their gardens. Following the L.A. riots, they increasingly fear that this 'underclass' will someday
demand its liberation. If human slaves are ultimately unreliable, then mechanical ones will have to
be invented. The search for the holy grail of 'Artificial Intelligence' reveals this desire for the Golem
- a strong and loyal slave whose skin is the colour of the earth and whose innards are made of sand.
As in Asimov's 'Robot' novels, the techno- utopians imagine that it is possible to obtain slave-like
labour from inanimate machines. Yet, although technology can store or amplify labour, it can never
remove the necessity for humans to invent, build and maintain these machines in the first place.
Slave labour cannot be obtained without somebody being enslaved.”



The law tends to lag behind societal paradigm shifts. It takes us some time to realize exactly
what is happening in the world around us, to observe it, to process it, to react to it. One may rest
assured that this is beneficial to the capitalists. Many people who are from this class will assert there
are no problems with the technology industry. Many claim workers' rights aren't needed because it
is “skilled labor”, however, this begs the question of exactly what kinds of riches they were born
with in the first place in order to be so insensitive towards others' needs. Many claim they are
satisfied with their work-life balance, perhaps because they have the privilege of setting the terms
under which they work in the first place.



“Across the world, the Californian Ideology has been embraced as an optimistic and
emancipatory form of technological determinism. Yet, this utopian fantasy of the West Coast
depends upon its blindness towards - and dependence on - the social and racial polarisation of the
society from which it was born. Despite its radical rhetoric, the Californian Ideology is ultimately
pessimistic about fundamental social change. Unlike the hippies, its advocates are not struggling to
build 'ecotopia' or even to help revive the New Deal. Instead, the social liberalism of New Left and
the economic liberalism of New Right have converged into an ambiguous dream of a hi-tech
'Jeffersonian democracy'. Interpreted generously, this retro-futurism could be a vision of a
cybernetic frontier where hi- tech artisans discover their individual self-fulfillment in either the
electronic agora or the electronic marketplace. **However, as the zeitgeist of the 'virtual class', the
Californian Ideology is at the same time an exclusive faith. If only some people have access to
the new information technologies, 'Jeffersonian democracy' can become a hi-tech version of
the plantation economy of the Old South. Reflecting its deep ambiguity, the Californian
Ideology's technological determinism is not simply optimistic and emancipatory. It is
simultaneously a deeply pessimistic and repressive vision of the future.** [1]”

3nfgzz,3,2015-10-04,Me [28 M] and my girlfriend [33F] of a year and a 1/2 are currently not having sex.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3nfgzz/me_28_m_and_my_girlfriend_33f_of_a_year_and_a_12/,"It’s been at least two weeks since we've had sex, and almost a month since the sex wasn't a chore for her. To be clear the lack of sex is a symptom of the greater issue of her becoming more and more indifferent to my needs. 

I’ll try to give some level of background that I think is pertinent to our current predicament. When we first met, she was living in her mother’s home, but her mother was living and working in a foreign country. We had a house to ourselves when our contradictory schedules could find time. I work nights &amp; weekends and she works a 9-5. The relationship from the get go required us both to sacrifice, but because of that it made us stronger cause both parties were trying dutifully to be together. We would get a few hours together on nights I’d get out early and could spend Saturday and Sunday mornings together. 


8 months into the relationship her mother moved back and threw a huge wrench in the spokes. Her mother would be in bed by 8:30 most nights, and because of that required that my girlfriend be back home by then because my girlfriends dog would keep her mother awake (a fair but difficult demand).  Now our time together was squeezed into the small amount of time on the one or two nights a week I was off and she was out of work. Often just 2 hours max made it difficult to spend time together let alone have any intimacy. The sex during that time was often lackluster because it was schedule and/or forced. 

We trudged through it for quite some time, but found ways to make the little time we had together feel like it was meaningful. The next few months were full of highs and lows. Her moms increasing resentment of her daughter still living at home, my fathers heart surgery, and a steady flow of unfortunate events as well as her receiving a promotion at work and me making moves towards my dreams of opening a restaurant. All of these things were tough to navigate but we both continued to sacrifice and try our best to accommodate each other’s idiosyncrasies.

After a month of her showing increasing disinterest in me and us as a partnership I finally broached the subject with her about a month and a half ago. We talked and found some middle ground in how I need to vocalize to her when I’m in need of attention, to be forward in letting her know when I’m feeling neglected. In exchange for me stepping out of my comfort zone to vocalize those needs clearly, she agreed to be more receptive and more specifically not to do what she had been doing which was recognizing that she was neglecting me and continue to do it purposefully out of spite. 

Things went along with what felt like a relief of tension between us. For her birthday we went to Vegas. It was a fun trip; we both seemed to be on the same track again. When we returned, she made the decision to move into her own place, and a real solution to our scheduling woes seemed to have finally come to fruition. 


Unfortunately/fortunately at the same time she moved into the new place I began taking a class and participating in an internship twice a week. My schedule now consists of no days off, and working for at the very least 3 hours, but usually 7-8 hours a night. We both have a strong support for each others dreams and aspirations, and she and I both admitted that it would be another obstacle [my endless work schedule] to navigate, but no less manageable than our previous obstacles  especially since her new apartment was a few short blocks from my job. 

The last two and a half weeks have been very boring. A ""good morning, how is your day text?” and ""good night and sleep well text"" is the breadth of our communication some days. When we do have time together I’ll show up at her place, she'll be dismissive until we smoke weed and then she'll play on her iPad and look at social media for two hours and then she'll go to bed. This week has been considerably tough because we both got sick. 

Yesterday afternoon I asked her ""is everything alright?"" she feigned from an answer and used the ""I’m just tired"" response. Which admittedly I have used, so I’m not angry about her using it, but it does illustrate to me that she is unhappy but not willing to be open about it. Instead of pressing the topic I decided to step back because I knew the lack of sex certainly has a large basis in both of us being sick. I spent the rest of that afternoon in urgent care 
and the doctors put me on prednisone (a steroid). I've taken it often (because of my asthma and weed/cigarette habit) when I’m sick and I am no stranger to its side effects. Which for me entail wild mood swings, and high irritability. 

So after returning from the doctor I decided when needed to talk face to face and that I needed to press the subject because if I don't vocalize my needs she can't meet them. So I brought it up that I felt she was being very dismissive and disengaging from me for a good two and a half weeks. She responded by saying that she was being both dismissive and disengaging, and that it was because she was stressed from work, being sick, and living in a new place that she hadn't fully moved into yet. All of these things are acceptable and human responses, what irks me is that she said those things and instead of trying to make some compromise of providing me a small level of attention and interest told me that I was just gonna have to put up with it for a while and that was that. 

I called in sick today to work so I could avoid the stress and exhaustion from managing my body's tumultuous state while on the clock, as well as to get to spend quality time with her hoping that I could coax some more of a conversation out of her. The day was a silent nightmare. We drove down to the valley, ate dinner at a shitty restaurant, and then drove back, and we said maybe two paragraphs to each other over the 3-hour period. We came home, she immediately smoked more weed and started playing on her iPad and looking at social media. now she is asleep.

**I’m at my wits end and that’s why I’m here. I think I vocalized my needs clearly, and she simply said tough shit I can't do that for you right now. I’m struggling with her response because she should and has the right to respond that way because not all needs can be met 24/7 in a relationship of any kind, but what am I supposed to do with these feelings of neglect--which are seeds of grand resentment--in the mean time? Do I just swallow them with the knowledge (or hope) that in due time she will come around again? Or do I continue to vocalize them because its what’s best for my mental health?**

This is the first point in our relationship where I feel like I’m just a static object in her life that will rub her back and get her weed. It doesn't not feel like a partnership anymore, it feels like a one-way street. 


---   
**tl;dr**: **girlfriend is straight forward to me that she is being dismissive and disengaging, but doesn't want to make any changes even though it hurts my feelings and deteriorates our trust. What can I do make her understand that her actions can be toxic?**

I'd like to become FI as soon as possible and be able to pursue whatever interests me. Luckily, I've landed a very high paying tech job at a company with good benefits. However, I'm kind of confused how I should calculate FI in this case, because the company is severely subsidizing COL.

Info about salary/assets:

* My yearly total cash compensation will be greater than $160,000.
* From previous internships and the signing bonus from my job offer, I have $17k in a Roth IRA and $41k in taxable accounts. Also have about 24k in checkings/savings accounts. 
* With grants, scholarships, and parent support, I have no student debt.

Benefits:

* Company provides free meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner) along with to-go boxes, so I could feasibly eat entirely on company dollar if I so desired. I interned there over the summer and brought enough to-go food home on Thursdays/Fridays to tide me over during weekends so it's definitely possible.
* Company also provides free cell phone with tethering.
* Company also provides very good healthcare with monthly premium entirely covered, copays $10 for nearly everything (including surgery/hospitalization) with no coinsurance.
* Company provides transportation pass for city along with company shuttle. I'm not planning on owning a car.

I'm looking at apartments with rent $1.5-2k/month (which is reasonable for the Bay Area, also factoring in the fact that I need to choose a place close to a company shuttle stop and public transportation if I don't want a car). 

I don't plan on buying a house in the Bay Area. I'd rather move to a nice place in the middle of the country and buy a house when I retire. 

Anyway, in summary, as it looks now, I will probably not spend more than 2.5k/month. By those numbers, I will probably be able to save ~$70k a year. When I run FI calculators, it tells me I could retire in 7-10 years, but that is on highly subsidized expenses of only ~$30k/year. Is it still feasible for me to become FI in that time frame? I'm not interested in getting married/having children, so my costs will probably remain stable throughout my pursuit of FI, but it is hard for me to imagine how much health insurance and other things will cost when I become independent. To complicate matters, I have a currently mild auto-immune condition that is known to get worse in about 10% of people (not life-threatening, per se, but can be expensive without good health insurance).

Also, should I still contribute $18k to a 401k every year if I can't touch it until I quite a while after I become FI?"
3nftfq,5,2015-10-04,Finding an internship in Estonia,Nothorized,Eesti,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eesti/comments/3nftfq/finding_an_internship_in_estonia/,"Hi,

I'm a college student in France. I'm studying Computer Science. My engineering school has agreement with the Tallinn University of Technology, and i'm required to make an internship of 3 months between June and the beginning of September. 

What is the process for finding an internship in Estonia? Should i just send cold emails to all the companies I can find online, or is there a public board? Also, I don't speak neither Estonian nor Russian, will it be hard for me to work and live in Estonia?"

Apologizes later.",OpenCali,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3nfwi3/my_910_so_19f_of_5_years_thinks_really_low_of_me/,"I knew my girlfriend from high school. She saved me from being hit by speeding car, we got closer together after that and she became my SO. Fast forward 5 years, I chose to intern during summer against my gf's wishes for a holiday. She was okay with it. My new job stressed me off so much that I kept ignoring her wishes to go places or reply to her messages. didn't complain though. We run a startup together that is largely financed by her and has been running alright for some months. My girlfriend had been selected for an award ceremony at her school, I took a day off and went ahead to attend it. 



When I stood there along with her, her 'good looking' seniors came to congratulate her. Then there was this bunch from the media who asked her if she was interested in being a model and kept praising her 'shiny sun kissed skin', body and face in a very uncomfortable way. Some of the guys were clearly crossing the line and flirting with her, right in front of me. My gf tried introducing me in between the conversation but I was invisible to them. They gave her their busienss card. But she claimed to have no cards and said she'd give them her number. She gave my second number to them instead.  



We had a couple of drinks that night. When we came home, she tore their cards and threw them into the bin. 


She looks at me for minute and says ""You know what ? People used to tell that I'm way out of your league and I deserve better. My friend thinks I might be a gold digger but they don't know that you didn't buy me nothing ever and I never asked. I spend half of my savings for your crazy business ideas believing everything you tell. I keep turning down guys better than you, who hit on me all the time thinking I'm available because you're never ever seen with me. And look at yourself, you would never get a girl... not one as good as me who would love you to death. But you know what ? Fuck what people think - I fucking love you even though you take me for granted.""



I knew it was the alcohol speaking so resisted from getting jumpy about it. After a few minutes she tells ""I'm really sorry for what I just said, I wish I could take those back. "" I said it's alright. She slept early and we didn't have sex that night. The next morning, she goes to school as usual. 



I have my share of insecurities already. I'm an average guy who is kind of short 5'7. My girl friend is fit and 5'6. I'm skinny fat. My girlfriend used to tease my man-boobs while having sex. She used to call me to join her at gym classes so I could ""get healthy together"". She calls me a bear because I'm too hairy. One night I found her shaving my body while I'm asleep with a trimmer but I thought it was merely a joke. 


She clearly doesn't agree with me the way our startup is going because it was always me taking the calls against her disagreements. I guess she found it unfair because she was the one financing it. I can now recollect every single disagreement I ignored without giving a second thought. I never had expectations from her because she was perfect, but that wasn't her case.



After that night. I had posted my pic and her pic separately on r/rateme. She was rated &gt;9. I was rated below 5 with long lists of suggestions to improve - the same stuff my gf kept repeating. That confirmed it. 



I knew I was out of her league but I underestimated that gap. I wonder why she still clings on to me. She really does deserve better. I think she feels tempted to cheat with ""the better guys"" as she puts it but I hold her back. 


The only reason she is with me is because we started out young but now she realizes she is eligible for ""better guys"". She grew up to be accomplished and hot. I OTOH, am a below dorky looser. I'm glad she opened her mind when she was drunk, about what she really thought about me. 


Don't you think it's fair if I tell I'm okay with letting her go if she wants to leave ? Although I would be lying about it because I would take forever to get over it, I only wish her to be happy.    


   
**tl;dr**: Was in an uncomfortable discussion with guys hitting on my SO in front of me. But was happy she didn't play it back. After reaching home, drunk Gf yelled at me for ignoring her. Revealed that she thinks low of me and she could get more attractive mates than I can. Apologizes later. I'm thinking of telling her I'm okay if she wants to leave me but actually I'm not.

3ng6mn,4,2015-10-04,Me [21m] and my gf [20f] are having problems now because she's having doubts 3.5+ yrs into our relationship,teeman12,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3ng6mn/me_21m_and_my_gf_20f_are_having_problems_now/,"It started with my decision to forgo law school so here's some background. A lot of background...

Last summer (2014) I studied everyday for my LSAT. Scored very well (172) and unfortunately didn't get into the schools I wanted. I had a lower ugpa which contributed to the problem. However, of the schools I did get admissions to I didn't receive enough scholarship and after thinking long and hard I decided against going because I knew what the job market was like. Going 150k into debt is not simple and honestly if it isn't T-20 or T-14 for that matter the job hunt becomes even harder. But I always had a back up plan which is currently completing my MBA and MSF (finance masters). 

So that decision was made this spring/early summer (2015). She has a problem with this and its Oct now. Lemme also add something into the mix here. Gonna rewind slightly.

My senior year at college, Michigan State University, was a little hectic and I spent a lot of time recuperating my gpa and being an active member in clubs and whatnot. She did not have a problem with this; however, she did have a problem with my lack of communication skills. I wasn't the best texter or caller during that time period but I stepped it up big time.

It's Jan 2015 and she tells me that she's been hired for a summer internship in NYC. I was ecstatic! That's an awesome opportunity but then hold up, wait what? She didn't even tell me she was planning on going she only told me when she was hired so that threw me off especially since she bugged me about talking to her more. Now we continue to communicate well and law school stuff and I make my decision, now it's June when she leaves for NYC. Btw we are both from Michigan so not tooo far but kind of. 

She tells her parents around this time that I decided against law school. This really irked them because they started questioning my ability to provide for her and if I was smart enough to make the right decisions. She couldn't even back me up when speaking to them only crying. Her dad doesn't do his research before commenting and still doesn't btw so he still thinks I'm an idiot because of this decision. Okay fine I just have to prove myself in this career field I thought. Now since my gf was in NY and working comm became an issue on her side so I mentioned that she could text or Skype me a little more and she agreed she just told me that she was overwhelmed at work and things would return to normal after she had returned to Michigan. That was fine with me.

Aug 2015 she returns and her brother proposed to his long time gf of 8 yrs. Yeah 8 yrs... But that was over summer I knew about that sorry for a slight rewind again but back to Aug. There was an engagement party that I wasn't invited to because her parents were afraid of me being out of place with her whole family. Made sense, btw we are Indian so the cultural differences make it sound bad, but in actuality it isn't that bad. But I still felt a little weird. 

Now it's sept and she's going back to school. She goes to umich and I'm back home since I graduated from MSU so she's now only 15/20 min away from me which was great! I would be able to see her much more often. Boy was I wrong. She became so busy for the first 3 weeks that I would barely get a text response from her. These conversations lasted about 5 texts so I felt a little pushed aside, however, I knew that it was the beginning of school and that she was busy but really only 5 texts? And that is no joke, I have my text history to prove it. But again I felt pushed aside and hurt especially after she made it a point that we (I) needed to communicate better in the past (start of the 2014 school year) 

I met with her a couple of days ago because we needed to talk. She dropped a bombshell on me. This was this past Thursday, Oct 1st 2015. She started telling me that our core values were different and that her family is very important to her.  She wanted to be able to uphold the way she was raised into the future and the way things were going, she wasn't so sure, telling me the future was hazy. I was devastated, I was not expecting that. Where was this coming from? Why did she not tell me this sooner? She then tells me that she was hiding these feelings from me because she was scared for what's to come.

here's a little more backstory. Sorry for the terrible organization but its really hard to type this up. Plus I'm on my nexus 5 (old one) so its not the easiest to go back and edit. 

She was raised quite leniently and by that I mean throughout high school and college she was/is quite a free bird. I on the other hand was not. My parents were very strict about being disciplined with school work and shit. Typical brown parents. Here's what came up in the argument that Thursday. She comes from a slightly wealthier family than I, so she thinks because of that, our core values are different and the way we were raised was different. Don't get me wrong however, I do not come from a poor family, far from it. My parents had the ability to provide me whatever I wanted and give me that freedom but they wanted to raise me otherwise, making me earn everything I had, turning me into a disciplined adult. And although their methods were slightly off, I still love them and have a great relationship with them. But the fundamentals of how we were raised were the same. She just had more freedom in doing things and hanging out. Wasn't a big deal to me because that was the past. 6 years ago past. When i didnt even know she existed. but apparently it's a big deal to her. I envied that type of relationship however and I wanted that in the future, how she was raised. That was something I always wanted and she knows that but for some reason that type of future is hazy? 

She said she wanted to figure things out and she imagined that would only come with time and more security from my end. I get it, its still about my career choice. But okay I have to prove to her that this is the right choice for me. I'm extremely happy with the decision I made and I actually have interviews already with the likes of some big names, Grant Thornton, DTE Energy, just to name a few. So I don't get where the insecurity stems from in my career choice. 

So currently we are still together because she said she doesnt want to lose me and that she loves me and she wants to go through this day by day and address problems as they come up. I have no problem with that. But I can't help but feel like a sitting duck waiting for my heart to be broken :/ is that wrong of me to feel that way? What do I do besides continue on? I love her with everything that I've got and I don't want to lose such an amazing woman. But I feel led on. For 3.5+yrs. 

How do I help alleviate the insecurity she's having or can I at all? I know I have to wait but its killing me inside. I know that proving myself in my career is one way to provide that security which she asked from me and I'm doing that right now. My interview with Grant Thornton is tomorrow. Oct 5th and I need to fucking nail this interview. I just have a bad feeling that she's hinging our relationship on these few interviews I have even though I just started my masters program. Wtf do I do? 

I know there are obvious holes in the story and if anyone wants to know something specific, you know what to do but for now I sign off and i appreciate any advice on how to deal with this current situation. 

TL;DR: my gf is having doubts about our 3.5+ yr relationship after I made the choice to forgo law school, hid the problems and feelings, now they're coming out and its a bombshell."

This matters to me and I’d like you to give thoughts if you actually read the whole thing.

Back at the beginning of August, I met a girl on the Yik Yak of Disney World(Yik Yak is a phone app for the area you’re in where people can anonymously post stuff and people can anonymously comment). We chatted and I asked for her number and then we started texting. I’m 20, she’s 21. She lived in Louisiana but spent the last two years at DW doing the college intern program. She’s in LA right now finishing up her last semester of university. We really clicked because we exchanged pictures and found each other attractive and we’re both strong Christians and we’re both politically conservative. Plus, we both found out we’re both virgins and never had relationships. We really hit it off. Like 4 or 5 days into texting, we were talking about our personal sin struggles and she confided in me that she went through a really bad phase of personal sexual sin and she got pretty detailed and said it still haunted her and shamed her and I was the only one she had told before in her whole life(was her telling me that so early a red flag I should’ve recognized?). Then we started to skype video chat once or twice a week.

We’d text everyday and she’d often text first and be pretty apologetic when she’d take a long time to respond. We’d skype for hours each time and she’d often stay up pretty late to talk to me. She just seemed really into me. This was over Summer when we texted and skyped the most because we both had a lot of free time.

School started up and then it was September and she got super busy. She had classes M-F all morning until 1 and then an internship, plus she’d watch her older sister’s daughter a lot. The internship had a big project due in October, also. So she’d get pretty hyper-busy. We’d still text everyday and she’d sometimes take hours to reply but was always pretty sorry for the delay. Basically from the beginning of August to the end of September we’d text almost everyday and Skype for hours once a week. Like I said, sometimes it took a while like one time I texted her at 5pm one day and didn’t get a reply til 6AM the next morning. Oh yeah, worth mentioning at this point, she said she was going to move to Orlando in December after she graduated to move her way up in Disney. I go to FSU and my hometown is near Tampa so that, to me, was the glimmer of real life, long-term potential, eventually. 

We’d get fairly flirty and it would border on sexual but we’d stop ourselves because we wanted to stay pure and not go into sin that we had both struggled with in the past. I once texted her hey at 3AM because I was in that kind of mood and she texted back the next day asking what I was doing up and I said I was in an aroused mood so it was good that she wasn’t up. She didn’t make a big deal out of it. 

There were a few bumps in the road. Over Labor Day weekend, I texted her that(I know this was a horrible idea) I felt sexually frustrated. She said her mom might’ve seen the text because her phone was on a table and lit up near her, but she wasn’t sure. So she was a bit freaked about that. The next night I texted her at 3AM that I was “so f***ing sexually frustrated” and I was angry about it because it was just annoying and I was sad that she always goes to bed early. She texted me the next day that I needed to get control of myself, that she told me her struggle as a way of understanding and not to be a partner In crime and that she didn’t try to control her urges for a guy to come drag her into sin. I apologized a lot. I did feel terrible for weirding her out and probably looking like a lousy, backslidden Christian to her. The next bunch of days she was fairly coy in texting and said she was super busy and that “my text had taken her by surprise and she was pondering over it”. Then the texting picked up the next couple days. I had to clarify that I was sad she was asleep so I couldn’t confide in her, not because I wanted to sin with her. 
A week later she was coy again and finally said she was super busy but also wasn’t texting back much because she didn’t know how to define us and couldn’t formulate her thoughts for a while. She said she didn’t want to date because she was super busy, had “family junk” and baggage and it was just “complicated”. She said she had a lot in common with me and fun talking with me and wouldn’t rule out dating in the future but wanted to be friends at the moment and see where things could go. I was fine with that. Then things got pretty back to normal and she was talkative. The last time we skyped was two weeks ago and it went well, she stayed for like an hour longer than she said she would. Then the following week texting was good. 

Oh yeah, this is now important. Back in August, she said she was going to Disney for a 5 day family vacation at the end of September and we briefly flirted with the idea of hanging out for a day but then forgot. Last Friday I texted her and asked If she wanted to hang out for a day when she went. No reply. Saturday morning I saw she replied to an article I had posted on her FB wall but still not my text, which I thought was a bit off. No text all day and I said Saturday night that if she didn’t want to, it was no big deal. Still no reply. On Sunday evening I just texted “lol, guess not”. At this point, it felt very weird. She’d always replied, especially within a day or two. I started to get the uneasy feeling she was avoiding the issue or starting to ghost me. On Tuesday I sent her a FB message asking if she had gotten my texts. I saw that she had been active on FB everyday. So at this point I started feeling very insecure, insulted and hurt. My message remained delivered but unopened even when she was online. I basically lost it at that point and blew up her phone saying if she wanted to talk about something or didn’t want to hang, it was totally fine but if she was avoiding talking to me or outright ghosting me then it was rude, cowardly and disrespectful. It was the first time I had ever ripped into her and I shouldn’t have but I just felt hurt and ignored. Some friends I had gotten some advice from told me to just wait it out but I didn’t listen and just exploded on her. I once texted her “What the f*** did I do wrong?” Still silence. It utterly ate me up.

Some theories some friends of mine had were that she was too nervous to hang out, couldn’t ditch her family(but that shouldn’t be hard to talk about), just didn’t want to hang out, and one theory of my own. She’s a thick girl. She told me she’s extremely sensitive and self-conscious about her weight and she gained weight over Summer and felt too pudgy lately. I told her I liked thick girls so she had no reason to feel self-conscious around me. She started working out again when the school year started but stopped because she got too busy. She also told me she stress eats a lot. When we last skyped, even though it went well, I noticed that she turned her camera off when she got up to go to a different room for a second, which she’d never done before. Maybe she felt fat and didn’t want me to see her. I can see how if she can’t stand to have me see her full body on skype, she’d never want to hang out for a day. I think it’s dumb because I love thick girls but I can see how she wouldn’t want to give that as the reason. Still, she shouldn’t have ignored me. 

On Wednesday I sent some more angry texts saying more of the same and just asking her to say something. I ripped into her more and said that in hindsight it was a complete double standard for her to tell me her personal sexual sin struggles in very open detail so early but for her to get weirded out by my 3AM moment of weakness. I also said if she felt self-conscious about hanging out with me, she had no reason to since I think she’s lovely. I said to her just to say anything. Still silence.

This was probably the worst thing I did but my frustration pretty much got desperate beyond belief and on Facebook I messaged her BFF that she’d often talk to me about and asked her if she knew if the girl didn’t want to talk anymore and that I just felt hurt and insulted. Shortly after, both the girl and her BFF blocked me on FB and I hadn’t gotten any word from the girl herself. 
I did get a message from the girl’s younger sister saying that she had an episode a year ago and now suffers from an identity disorder and a lot of it involved talking too much to people online so a week back she agreed to get help and they were cutting her off from social media and online contacts. I think I was just getting BSed so I’d go away. If that’s truly the case, then whatever, but I’m pretty sure I was just getting lied to. Regardless, I just messaged her sister back that I really apologized for exploding and I didn’t want to lose the girl’s friendship. It was seen but I got no reply.

I’m now massively regretting what I did. I really wasn’t expecting her to block me and cut me off completely with no talk about it but I guess I really freaked her out. I shouldn’t have exploded but I just was left scratching my head as to why she stopped talking to me for those couple days that led to my meltdown. I got opinions from a few friends and the guy friends said asking her to hang out was fine and she was rude and I was justified in calling her out, or I at least should’ve texted less and been more delicate. A female friend thought it was too early to ask to hang out and I should’ve just let it go and not ripped into her at all.

Thoughts? Any chance she might want to get back in touch a month or two down the line? We really did click immensely well before things got weird. It was a largely very enjoyable two months of friendship with some flirtiness.

On Wednesday I sent some more angry texts saying more of the same and just asking her to say something. I ripped into her more and said that in hindsight it was a complete double standard for her to tell me her personal sexual sin struggles in very open detail so early but for her to get weirded out by my 3AM moment of weakness. I also said if she felt self-conscious about hanging out with me, she had no reason to since I think she’s lovely. I said to her just to say anything. Still silence.

This was probably the worst thing I did but my frustration pretty much got desperate beyond belief and on Facebook I messaged her BFF that she’d often talk to me about and asked her if she knew if the girl didn’t want to talk anymore and that I just felt hurt and insulted. Shortly after, both the girl and her BFF blocked me on FB and I hadn’t gotten any word from the girl herself. 

I did get a message from the girl’s younger sister saying that she had an episode a year ago and now suffers from an identity disorder and a lot of it involved talking too much to people online so a week back she agreed to get help and they were cutting her off from social media and online contacts. I think I was just getting BSed so I’d go away. If that’s truly the case, then whatever, but I’m pretty sure I was just getting lied to. Regardless, I just messaged her sister back that I really apologized for exploding and I didn’t want to lose the girl’s friendship. It was seen but I got no reply.

I’m now massively regretting what I did. I really wasn’t expecting her to block me and cut me off completely with no talk about it but I guess I really freaked her out. I shouldn’t have exploded but I just was left scratching my head as to why she stopped talking to me for those couple days that led to my meltdown. I got opinions from a few friends and the guy friends said asking her to hang out was fine and she was rude and I was justified in calling her out, or I at least should’ve texted less and been more delicate. A female friend thought it was too early to ask to hang out and I should’ve just let it go and not ripped into her at all.

Thoughts? Any chance she might want to get back in touch a month or two down the line? We really did click immensely well before things got weird. It was a largely very enjoyable two months of friendship with some flirtiness.

3nh6tq,2,2015-10-04,What went wrong in this online friendship/relationship?,DaftLink_I17,dating,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/3nh6tq/what_went_wrong_in_this_online/,"This is something that starts out sounding pretty dumb and trivial but turns into a bit more and had eventual real potential. This matters to me and I’d like you to give thoughts if you actually read the whole thing.

Back at the beginning of August, I met a girl on the Yik Yak of Disney World(Yik Yak is a phone app for the area you’re in where people can anonymously post stuff and people can anonymously comment). We chatted and I asked for her number and then we started texting. I’m 20, she’s 21. She lived in Louisiana but spent the last two years at DW doing the college intern program. She’s in LA right now finishing up her last semester of university. We really clicked because we exchanged pictures and found each other attractive and we’re both strong Christians and we’re both politically conservative. Plus, we both found out we’re both virgins and never had relationships. We really hit it off. Like 4 or 5 days into texting, we were talking about our personal sin struggles and she confided in me that she went through a really bad phase of personal sexual sin and she got pretty detailed and said it still haunted her and shamed her and I was the only one she had told before in her whole life(was her telling me that so early a red flag I should’ve recognized?). Then we started to skype video chat once or twice a week.

We’d text everyday and she’d often text first and be pretty apologetic when she’d take a long time to respond. We’d skype for hours each time and she’d often stay up pretty late to talk to me. She just seemed really into me. This was over Summer when we texted and skyped the most because we both had a lot of free time.

School started up and then it was September and she got super busy. She had classes M-F all morning until 1 and then an internship, plus she’d watch her older sister’s daughter a lot. The internship had a big project due in October, also. So she’d get pretty hyper-busy. We’d still text everyday and she’d sometimes take hours to reply but was always pretty sorry for the delay. Basically from the beginning of August to the end of September we’d text almost everyday and Skype for hours once a week. Like I said, sometimes it took a while like one time I texted her at 5pm one day and didn’t get a reply til 6AM the next morning. Oh yeah, worth mentioning at this point, she said she was going to move to Orlando in December after she graduated to move her way up in Disney. I go to FSU and my hometown is near Tampa so that, to me, was the glimmer of real life, long-term potential, eventually. 

We’d get fairly flirty and it would border on sexual but we’d stop ourselves because we wanted to stay pure and not go into sin that we had both struggled with in the past. I once texted her hey at 3AM because I was in that kind of mood and she texted back the next day asking what I was doing up and I said I was in an aroused mood so it was good that she wasn’t up. She didn’t make a big deal out of it. 

There were a few bumps in the road. Over Labor Day weekend, I texted her that(I know this was a horrible idea) I felt sexually frustrated. She said her mom might’ve seen the text because her phone was on a table and lit up near her, but she wasn’t sure. So she was a bit freaked about that. The next night I texted her at 3AM that I was “so f***ing sexually frustrated” and I was angry about it because it was just annoying and I was sad that she always goes to bed early. She texted me the next day that I needed to get control of myself, that she told me her struggle as a way of understanding and not to be a partner In crime and that she didn’t try to control her urges for a guy to come drag her into sin. I apologized a lot. I did feel terrible for weirding her out and probably looking like a lousy, backslidden Christian to her. The next bunch of days she was fairly coy in texting and said she was super busy and that “my text had taken her by surprise and she was pondering over it”. Then the texting picked up the next couple days. I had to clarify that I was sad she was asleep so I couldn’t confide in her, not because I wanted to sin with her. 

A week later she was coy again and finally said she was super busy but also wasn’t texting back much because she didn’t know how to define us and couldn’t formulate her thoughts for a while. She said she didn’t want to date because she was super busy, had “family junk” and baggage and it was just “complicated”. She said she had a lot in common with me and fun talking with me and wouldn’t rule out dating in the future but wanted to be friends at the moment and see where things could go. I was fine with that. Then things got pretty back to normal and she was talkative. The last time we skyped was two weeks ago and it went well, she stayed for like an hour longer than she said she would. Then the following week texting was good. 

Oh yeah, this is now important. Back in August, she said she was going to Disney for a 5 day family vacation at the end of September and we briefly flirted with the idea of hanging out for a day but then forgot. Last Friday I texted her and asked If she wanted to hang out for a day when she went. No reply. Saturday morning I saw she replied to an article I had posted on her FB wall but still not my text, which I thought was a bit off. No text all day and I said Saturday night that if she didn’t want to, it was no big deal. Still no reply. On Sunday evening I just texted “lol, guess not”. At this point, it felt very weird. She’d always replied, especially within a day or two. I started to get the uneasy feeling she was avoiding the issue or starting to ghost me. On Tuesday I sent her a FB message asking if she had gotten my texts. I saw that she had been active on FB everyday. So at this point I started feeling very insecure, insulted and hurt. My message remained delivered but unopened even when she was online. I basically lost it at that point and blew up her phone saying if she wanted to talk about something or didn’t want to hang, it was totally fine but if she was avoiding talking to me or outright ghosting me then it was rude, cowardly and disrespectful. It was the first time I had ever ripped into her and I shouldn’t have but I just felt hurt and ignored. Some friends I had gotten some advice from told me to just wait it out but I didn’t listen and just exploded on her. I once texted her “What the f*** did I do wrong?” Still silence. It utterly ate me up.

Some theories some friends of mine had were that she was too nervous to hang out, couldn’t ditch her family(but that shouldn’t be hard to talk about), just didn’t want to hang out, and one theory of my own. She’s a thick girl. She told me she’s extremely sensitive and self-conscious about her weight and she gained weight over Summer and felt too pudgy lately. I told her I liked thick girls so she had no reason to feel self-conscious around me. She started working out again when the school year started but stopped because she got too busy. She also told me she stress eats a lot. When we last skyped, even though it went well, I noticed that she turned her camera off when she got up to go to a different room for a second, which she’d never done before. Maybe she felt fat and didn’t want me to see her. I can see how if she can’t stand to have me see her full body on skype, she’d never want to hang out for a day. I think it’s dumb because I love thick girls but I can see how she wouldn’t want to give that as the reason. Still, she shouldn’t have ignored me.

*Marcus is sitting in his room, on his computer of course. The last few days has been stressful, to say the least. As he is about to click something on Myspace, he gets a knock on the door.*

""Son, can I come in?""

*Marcus thinks he knows what this is all about.*

""Ummm, sure. Come in dad.""

*Yotta's father, Tanner, opens the door, sitting down next to the child. Marcus stands up to greet his father.*

""You haven't eaten in days.""

""I had some chips,"" *Marcus sarcastically responds.*

""Seriously, what's on you mind? You can tell me anything, I'm your dad.""

*'He is the best person to talk to right now. No one gets me like my dad.'*

""Well dad, there's this girl. She's funny, exciting, artistic, and beautiful. She's basically everything I'm not, and I told her how I feel. She said we should just be friends for now, and I pretty much told her it was BS, that girls only fall for the hot guys.""

*Tanner surprisingly hits the child across the behind. Even through his jeans, it still hurt quite a bit for Marcus.*

""Boy I thought I taught you better than that. Is that really what this is all about? You probably ruined any chance you had with this dream girl because you're acting like the whole world revolves around you. You're 12, Marcus; you're not supposed to be thinking about relationships, much less thinking you know how women work. They're not a single, bee-mind...""

""Hive-mind, dad.""

""Whatever, the point is, this girl, and every other girl, they're all different. She may like the hot guy, she may even like you, and is just shy. Hell, she may like girls.""

*Marcus giggles at the thought. His dad keeps talking.*

""When I joined the military, I always got my hair cut off base. There was this cute, young hair stylist. I would always go to her, pay the little extra instead of going on-base to get my cut, just to talk to her. Every other week, I would talk to this woman.""

""Wait dad, you said that before you met mom...""

""Let me finish. One day, I was going to get my hair cut, and I was finally going to ask this girl on a date. Only, she was sick that day. I was upset, but I got my haircut anyways. There was a pretty new intern that had just started a few days before. I didn't think much about it bu-""

""Mom...""

""Right. We hit if off. We talked hours after my haircut, and even went out for drinks the same night. A year later, we got married. A year after that, you were born. Things may not seem like they are working out, but they always do. You can't *make* things happen, Marcus. No amount of preparation can prepare you for what life throws at you. Remember that, son."" 

*'He's right. I was a complete jerk, to SC and to Lily. They didn't deserve any of that. As long as they're both happy. Now to tell him the other half of it.'*

""You're a good kid, Marcus. I know you're always wanting to do the right thing. I would let you get away with murder, if it were up to me.""

*Tanner laughs, trying to lighten the mood. Marcus gulps.*

*'You know, maybe I should tell him another time. He is right though, I should stop all this drama I'm causing.'*

""Thanks dad, I'm going to try this Myspace thing out now, should I make you a profile?""

""Oh no. You kids, talking on the computer will never catch on,"" *Tanner says as he leaves the room.*

*Yotta scrolls up, moving the mouse away from the 'inbox' section of a profile, to reveal the face of Lily.*

*'Can't snoop, can't do anything petty. We are still friends.'*

*Instead of clicking the inbox tab, he clicks the 'Edit profile' tab.*

*'Good thing I know HTML and CSS. Her page is about to look amazing.'*"

3nhfht,5,2015-10-04,Shadowing program,Midnightpanther4444,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/3nhfht/shadowing_program/,"Hi,

I am in the beginning of my third year at college studying engineering and I did two engineering internships the past two summers and I really didn't enjoy them. 

I've always wanted to work in the medical field but I really dislike needles,and I'm not sure how well I could handle blood and things like that but I hope it might be something I could get over.

 I am considering more and more to change majors but I want to be sure before I do anything. I was considering maybe looking for a shadowing opportunity at a local hospital, which is something I could probably find on campus but I wanted to ask for advice here first. I am late in my education but I don't want to regret not looking into something that could be better for me.

Honestly I'm not even sure if this is the right place to post this, sorry if it isn't but maybe you can guide me in the right direction if it isn't. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciate! 
Thank you. "

The first is a daddy/daughter, I don't mind going a bit dark on this one. Manipulation, Coercion, Grooming, Bimbofication, start it being noncon (it always moved to con though) are things I would interested to explore (her being bad and daddy has to punish her or the one daddy teaches her about reproduction are the most used in my experience and I'm bored of them).

I like to develop the story, before and after they have sex, so many times is develop and then after the sex is just sex sex sex, to me it gets boring and repetitive when this happens (I'm mainly interested in long term if clarification was needed)

The other one is different as I'm interested in a scenario where men just come and take me through out the day. It can be, I'm just a slut that likes to go around teasing older men and getting to have them fuck me no matter where, or I'm the intern at a company where my job is to be the office cum bucket.
I can do first or third person.

As for length at least a paragraph is nice but I'm not picky or too special about that, mainly I work with what you give me and i understand sometimes you only manage to get three sentences and the next you write two paragraphs, as long is not just ""yeah, you want to fuck daddy"" and nothing else is cool.

That said something i dislike a lot is when you write for me, a few actions that help the story flow, okay. But when you write what I say, reactions, what I feel, and do and worse a paragraph of that, I hate that. Once I can deal, the second time or if it's too bad I will drop it, sorry but I is a big pet peeve.

Main kinks; biting, choking, spanking, dirty talk, threesomes, nipple play, cum play, rough sex, sex in public places

I don't do, watersports, feces, blood, humiliation, torture, bestiality

Last but not least, if you're rude, pushy or is apparent you didn't read all that I wrote I won't want to continue or start."
3niarj,1,2015-10-04,Some advice on dealing with planning my travels?,lazytornado,travel,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/3niarj/some_advice_on_dealing_with_planning_my_travels/,"Hey guys, 

So I'm going to Kenya and South Africa this coming January and my plan was to stop over at Amsterdam and Belgium for 2 weeks in December as a stop over. Late summer the price for this was $1050 with the layover. However, I couldn't book my tickets yet since I didn't know my schedule until now, and the same flights cost around 1700$ now. If I choose to skip Europe, the price comes to $1000 range again. 

Dilemma: I can sort of go to California for those 2 weeks instead and then head to Kenya/South Africa but I planned this Europe trip in the summer and was really looking forward to it. I fear I will not be able to have the same experience as a college student in Europe anytime soon since I will have an internship next summer and other priorities to take care of. I don't know what I should do. Any advice is greatly appreciated it. 

To put things into perspective, I'm just a 19 year old college student and don't feel like asking my parents to fund the excess of my flights. (Even though they wouldn't mind)

TL,DR - Europe stopover became too expensive, considering California as an alternative. Fear of missing out on a much better experience in Europe."
3nii4c,1,2015-10-04,General uncertainty towards the future.,thelamestnerd,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3nii4c/general_uncertainty_towards_the_future/,"I'm currently in my first year of college and I'm studying at a school in the UK (I'm from the US). It's a great school and everything, ranked highly and all that great stuff. When I was applying for colleges this time last year, I didn't really know what I wanted to do or where I wanted to be. I didn't know if I wanted to be in a city or in the countryside, whether I wanted to be surrounded by people or kind of secluded and by myself. It wasn't until this summer that I started realizing, at least a little more than I already had, what I wanted. I really, really want to be in LA. I'm studying computer science, and there's boundless opportunity in LA and surrounding areas in California. LA is also a great place to create media and stuff, and aside from computer science, I'm also really interested in making videos. Not film really, but like internet videos. Probably not as a living (unless I ever could become lucky enough to work with the people I admire!) but just because I love the idea of making people laugh at my dumb jokes. LA is, of course, great for that kind of thing too. 
Where I am now is like the epitome of the stuff I like, from overcast skies and chilly weather to just about everyone owning a dog. I also get my own room here, as it's more typical to have a private room in a shared flat here than to live in shared-room dorm-style halls. And don't get me wrong, it's a cool place to be! But I don't feel like it's where I'm meant to be at this point in my life. I don't really want to talk to my friends about it because I feel like I'm being very over-dramatic, and I don't really want to talk to my mom or brother about it because they'll say that I just haven't been here long enough to have a good opinion and that I wouldn't like the California heat and stuff. I also don't really like to mention the funny video thing to anyone because my brother's thing comedy, and I'm sort of insecure about doing things that he's done because I don't want to feel like I'm just following his footsteps or something. That's never been the case, and I know people wouldn't see it that way, but I'm just a big dumb baby I guess. Anyway, getting me here in the first place cost so much (applying for a Visa is the worst thing ever and I would never wish it upon even my worst enemy) that I feel bad saying ""Haha you guys, just kidding! I don't wanna go to another country, don't worry about the $1500+ we spent just getting me a Visa, not counting airfare, passports, and priority service fees!"" I don't know, I can sit here and think ""well my life will go alright if I stay here, so I guess I can just stay."" But I can also wholeheartedly say that I don't feel like my life will go as great as I hope if I stay here. The internship opportunities at my school aren't so hot because they have a massive focus on paid internships. While that's awesome (money is awesome), that also closes off a lot of other opportunities for just gaining work and industry experience. I didn't really look into that at all when I decided to come here, which I hugely regret.
I've been looking into submitting apps to UCLA or USC to transfer next year. Probably leaning towards UCLA because it's around 10k cheaper for out-of-state people, and I can reduce that price even more if I stay off campus with some family I have out there. If I wanna do it, I have to do it now, and I also have to actually talk to at least my mom about it. But I've also only been here two weeks. I feel like I'm being a dramatic kid that's just costing her family more than whatever I'm fussing about is worth. I feel bad that I had been so fixed on coming here through the summer and now that's completely fizzled out.
I don't know what I wanna do. I don't want to waste another year here if I miss out on applying for a transfer this year. I hate the idea of gap years, and I wanna make every minute of whatever I end up doing count. I just feel like I'm not doing what I'm meant to be doing, and it just makes me feel miserable. Advice would be appreciated, I guess, but I know this is a lot to read and take it and it's mainly just childish complaining anyway. "
3niolv,2,2015-10-04,Just need to rant for a bit,flingthing76,MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/3niolv/just_need_to_rant_for_a_bit/,"Idk about this whole life thing right now haha whenever I try to make plans no one is available. I hardly ever get invited out so when on the rare chance I do get invited out and I'm not feeling it or don't have the money I feel terrible declining because who knows when my next chance will be. Social anxiety sucks

Girlfriend broke up with me this year and I'm quickly realizing now that in my senior year of college I have near to no social life and no friends. Shit sucks. 

Even though good stuff is happening like me getting a promotion at work and it looking as though I will have a summer internship this year I can't help but be frustrated by my social life and everything else.

On top of all of this so far this year I've never felt more ugly! My weight is at the highest its been and I just can't seem to lose. I feel disgusting a good 60% of the time! 

Thanks for reading if you have I appreciate it and just needed to rant"
3nism0,17,2015-10-04,"Me [22 F], trying to land my first job, am having a hard time reading my work environment with co-workers.",throwitaway445566,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3nism0/me_22_f_trying_to_land_my_first_job_am_having_a/,"I know this subreddit is for relationships, and in my opinion this is...so hopefully I'm okay posting it here. I really just need to get this whole situation off of my chest, so I apologize for the length in advance.

A little background: I am a 22-year-old recent college graduate that has been interning/working a seasonal position with an organization for almost three years. I did a total of three (unpaid) internships with them since the end of my sophomore year; during the second semester of my senior year, I was offered a paid seasonal position with the company that ran through August, but they've continued to renew my contract every month for a variety of reasons which I'll explain. 

Obviously you can never just expect internships to turn into full-time, permanent positions. I never expected that to happen even when I took the seasonal position; however, my bosses at that time both told me in confidence that they were looking to hire a coordinator, and that they were hoping the person in this seasonal position would slide into that role. So they gave me hope that three years of hard work might actually pay off, which I've carried with me for the past seven months. 

One of those two bosses left, creating two vacancies within the department: a manager and a coordinator. Being 22-years-old and fresh out of college, I never expected to be considered for the manager position; although I've been doing everything she did since she left to help my other boss out, I know that I'm young, and whether companies like to admit it or not, they aren't looking at 22-year-olds to manage other people. So, I've always had my sights set on coordinator. 

The company completely botches the hiring process for the manager, to the point where it's been three months and they've yet to hire someone. I've been doing all the heavy lifting, proving I can do the job, putting in 14-hour days, etc. So they decide they're going to hire the coordinator first, and they only post the position internally. I am one of four applicants. And this is where things get messy.

One applicant is my ""work best friend"". She's been interning for a year, but in a completely different department; our company is divided between sports and events. She works in events and hasn't the slightest clue about sports, and this job is 90 percent sports, 10 percent events. The other is a guy who lost out to me for the seasonal position, but was hired on as a graphic designer, but ""isn't happy"" and wants to move over into the coordinator position. The third person has only been with the company three months as an intern and is a fashion blogger, so she is hardly qualified in any capacity. 

I am upset with both of these people for different reasons. My best friend has told me time and again she doesn't want this position, that I'm more qualified, that she'd turn it down if she was offered it...so why did you apply? And why are you interviewing for it? She says she wants to have her contract extended to the end of the year and then move to New York, which the company offered her; knowing this, why wouldn't you tell everyone to not consider you?

I'm upset with my male coworker because he knows how hard I've worked for this coordinator position, never mentioned once about applying for it, and then does it anyway. Although I'm less upset now because I know he's no longer being considered, it irks me that someone would be so secretive about applying for a position.

Early this week a decision will be made concerning who will get the coordinator position; my best friend has an interview with the VP of Marketing tomorrow, and I had my ""interview"" with him over a week ago. I say ""interview"" because he took me out for coffee to ask me if I had applied for the position and talk to me about the department; I had no idea this was an interview and was never told it was, so I almost feel slighted because I didn't really prepare for it like that. 

I guess my biggest question to you guys, especially people with a lot of experience in the workforce, is am I handling this in an immature way? I'm just frustrated because I feel like no one's noticing that I work harder than everyone else who has applied for this position; I've shown everyone how committed I am and it hasn't seemed to give me a leg-up. In addition, I hardly feel like I can trust anyone around me. Knowing that I'm so close to finding out whether or not all this has paid off makes me physically ill, because I don't know how I'll react if it doesn't. I just need advice on how to get through this and how to deal with my co-workers, and I'm really sorry if this is rambling and all-over-the-place. I just don't know what to do.
   
**tl;dr**: Interned for 3 years at a company, chance to land first permanent job, feel like I'm being backstabbed by co-workers who haven't been there as long and don't deserve the position. How should I handle this? "

Now, I'm trying to cope with my first and only ever break-up and have no idea how to handle it",CPGemini08,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/3niuwx/i_22m_and_my_fiance_20f_decided_to_end_our_5_year/,"Hey everyone, So today my fiance 'M' and myself decided it was time to end our relationship after a total of 5 years, with a 2 year engagement.

It started back my freshman year of high school. I was a nerdy kid who happened to be good at soccer. She was friends with another teammate of mine. She came to one of my games, and we talked afterwards. Hit it off very quickly, so I added her on Facebook. We progressed from friends to FWB quick, and eventually after a few months decided to date.
This went on for a year and a half or so. Between this time period, we did multiple things including trips and so many dates I couldn't even count. She was constantly, however, texting many people between whenever we were with each other. She had many friends, both guys and girls. Something I was unfamilair with in high school.

Quick background. I grew up with a mom and dad, and a sister. Somewhat tight knit family, from a pretty strict household. I was a bit sheltered, but I was also a bit of an antisocial butterfly. I never went to talk to people, aside from my close friends. My family had never dealt with cheating, divorce, or anything to that nature thankfully. We also came from a mid-to-upper class upbringing. Her upbringing was a bit different. She grew up with a dad and a mom that cheated on her dad several times with several guys and a girl. Her family has a history of unfaithfullness on both sides, and so growing up for her, she partied and drank and smoke all before the age of 14. Her dad is a hardworking man, but they do live paycheck to paycheck. Also, I was a social virgin (and still am). Never drank or smoke. Now we've had sex plenty of times after being engaged, so I'm not denying that anymore lol. Very polite with her family, and I love to play with the kids. Sometimes I wish I was a Dad. It'd be amazing. This is how we met.

Throughout high school, I desocialized myself with friends, and focused on her. I put every hour I had into her and our relationship. The first time something went wrong, she was spending many hours and a few nights with her ex. Red flag #1. I dismissed it as teenager angst, and pushed it aside.
While her family absolutely adored me, my family at first did, but quickly she and some of my family had some arguing. This turned into larger scale arguments with my grandparents and some cousins, and to one side of the family and her not getting along. Red flag #2

When I moved to college my freshman year, she became close with one of my roommates. She would be excited to see him, and hang out with him when we were not together. I was trying to be understanding as having guy friends, but I felt a bit weird about the whole thing. One night at dinner, she told me he kissed her and wanted to do many things. I wanted to beat his ass, but she defended him. Red flag #3

There were many times with her I absolutely loved. She was a very funny and loving person when she wanted to be. She made me into who I am today, which was 100% different than who I was in high school, and I would never take that back.

We became engaged my sophmore year of college. I looked past all her mistakes and saw her potential as a mom and wife one day, and bought a nice ring. She said yes and we were the happiest we have ever been. A couple months after our engagement (December), she told me a year later she had a one month relationship with the same ex. Sex and everything. But she told me she would never do it again and things would be different.

And so they were. For the next couple months I guess that is. Now another side note on things. I'm going to school as an Operations/Supply Chain Manager and got myself an intern position where they are day by day impressed with my work. I've held that job for half a year tomorrow. Prior to that, worked at Best Buy for a year and a half, and prior to that at a nursing home for 4 four years. I'm currently now a senior in college, graduating next semester and hopefully taking a position at my intern place. She on the other hand has had several jobs, retail and restarurant. She's called off many times at the places, and has quit every one due to not getting along with people and drama. Currently, she has no job, after quitting just a month ago where she used to work in a retail position. She tried college for a semester, and decided it wasn't for her. She said she was always going to be a worker and a mom. A 50's housewife she would say.

And so leads to July of this year. She had always told me she was bi, which I was totally ok with and I'm glad she knew who she was. But, she told me she had a crush that lead to emotional feelings for this, uh, for lack of a better term, man-woman. Your stereotypical butch girl. She told me she would break-up with me before she cheated on me ever again. She would text her constantly while with me, and I never though much about it due to it being a girl. Little did I know.

Beginning of this August came, and she said ""I think we need to take a break"". As in, spend less time together and focus on ourselves. At first, I hated the idea. But the more I thought about it, the more it made sense. I'm down for a break apart I thought, as long as it meant you would miss me and maybe we'd come back as fresh people.

How wrong that was. She, like two weeks later, began hanging out with this girl. She told me she kissed her, no sex, but still. And I was telling myself, she'll go through this phase and things will change for the better and she'll realize I'm the better future, and clean up her act. Unfortunately, she didn't. I've seen her phone notifications with the girl calling her babe, the colored pages of kids books from the girls nieces, the whole nine yards. She even told me ""you have no idea how easy it is to love two people"".

So in comes today. After talking with a lot of my friends, both guys and girls, I'm convinced I deserve better. Someone who loves the little things I did for her (like Paul McCartney tickets next week, refinishing her hardwood floors, flowers, you name it). I tried, some would say, too hard for her. And on top of that, we bought a dog together. My first ever. But Nala is now my best friend, and she lives with M right now. I want her, because I'll have no one at my house. But so will she, so how do we do that? I don't want to see her for a long time, M that is. I need to distance myself so I don't remind myself of what we used to be.
Did I have my mistakes? Absolutely. I was a bit socially inept, sometimes obnoxious, a bit snoopy (you can see why), and sometimes selfish. Over the years a lot of that got much better, but some last. Mainly the socially inept part, but I'm sure I'll come out of my shell. Might as well, not like I have a better way to spend a Friday night anymore!

So I guess my question is, why didn't I do this sooner? Why did I ignore the multiple red flags for love? Now what? You guys know my backstory pretty well after this wall of text. How do I recoup from a 5 year relationship with who I thought was my best friend?

Thanks for any and all advice. I've cried so much today, reading these responses might make the day go by a bit better.


TL;DR: 5 year relationship with so many red flags, but I the nerd fell in love with the beauty, and wouldn't take any hints from before. Now, I'm sitting at my computer crying because I made the decision to end it and I don't know how to cope, being my first and only ever true relationship."
3njh36,11,2015-10-05,Help with being the unfavored child. (long story),kraklowj,TrollXSupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrollXSupport/comments/3njh36/help_with_being_the_unfavored_child_long_story/,"I just turned 20 in September but for as long as I can remember, I’ve always been the unfavored child, even though my sister and I are twins. My sister moved out a little under two years ago to go to school up by my dad, about an hour and a half from home, and my mom was perfectly okay with it. I moved out about 6 months after she did for the same reason, except my school is half an hour closer and I would be living on my own and working full-time as well, but my mom acts like its the worst thing ever. I pay for rent, my own phone, my own car, utilities, gas and food, and everything else you would typically need to pay for to get by on your own, and just paid off my computer in June, and I never ask for money, but my sister doesn’t pay for anything on her own, works 12 hours a week, and gets all the money and things that she asks for. Yet I’m always called the ungrateful one who always has an attitude and never comes home to see my family. Never mind the fact that I worked full time during the day and weekends and go to school full time (right now I have 4 night classes) so I don't have the time to come home. My sister comes home all weekend, every weekend, mainly to see her boyfriend, sometimes even during the week, and always goes on weekend trips with my family or always goes out and does stuff with my mom, which makes me look like even worse of a daughter and like I don't care to see my family, but as I said, I physically just don't have the time. Even throughout high school, it was similar, with me getting kicked out, always having a job and never asking for anything because I would use my own money, but I was somehow always ungrateful.
After I moved out, I got in a car accident, which is when everything went downhill (somehow that was still possible) and I didn't talk to anyone in my family for months, changed my phone number and moved to a new place so they didn't know my address. I was seeing a therapist by this time to help deal with depression, anxiety, PTSD and whatnot from being raped several times by two different ex-boyfriend, and she helped me come to the realization that the whole situation with my family was based on my mom always favoring my twin sister. I was never good enough or as smart as her and she always expected me to be like my sister, and when I wasn’t, it would start another fight. 
This past weekend, my sister visited my grandma (my mom’s mom) who I've never been close with, and my sister somehow put her under the impression that I have absolutely no money (since my hours had just got cut in half due to it being the slow season) and that I’m not able to buy food or pay any of my bills, when in reality, I’m not having any problems. Meanwhile, my mom went up to Chicago with me to look at the school I decided to transfer to next year, a branch off the same school my sister is going to, except about an hour and half further away, and my mom literally started crying in the middle of a session because I was being “rude and ungrateful” to which she followed by ignoring me for 2 hours and showing no interest or even acting like she cared about the school I’m transferring too. Later, she all but told me I’m not good enough for that school, and I should just stick to a local university about an hour from home, and not major in business because I’m basically just not smart enough for it. This is when we started to get in another fight. My mom continuously implied that she hates the school I’m transferring to, and I’m ungrateful because I want to move up to Chicago to get a good education and have more career opportunities. Except it is the EXACT same school my sister is going to, only a separate branch in a different city, tuition is cheaper, and it has a really good business program rather than a good agriculture program at my sister's school.
Now, back to my grandma. When I got home later that night, my grandma called me around 10pm to tell—not ask—that she was coming over to bring me money and buy me food because apparently I have no money from what my sister said. Not to mention I start another job this week where I will be getting paid more and be working more hours, but apparently I’m “just not good enough to handle that” even though I’ve gone to school and worked, both full time, already without any problems. Anyway, I told my grandma that her coming over the next morning wouldn't work out because it was such short notice, and since I was sick from food poisoning and just wanted to sleep all day, and then catch up on homework later the next night (and because she has no idea where I live nor how to get there and there are no easy directions for someone who doesn't have a clue how to get around the city I live in). I straight up told her that I would be sleeping all day, so when she called me in the morning, guess what? I WAS ASLEEP so I didn't answer, and she left several voicemails because she was ""worried sick,"" even though I told her I would be asleep. My sister freaked out on me, she’s always acted more like a mom than a sister as she always screams at me like a parent would, and my mom tried texting me once, both to yell at me to stop ignoring them and my grandma and to call my grandma. I didn't see the messages right away because why? You’re right again, I was asleep. Once I was awake and my family had gotten ahold of me, they were saying my grandma was damn near tears because i was being ungrateful, yet again, and ignoring her. At some point before then, though, I woke up and tried calling my grandma back, who didn't answer, so I went back to sleep. Eventually I called again and got ahold of her later that night to apologize for not answering because I wasn't feeling well and was asleep all day, something I’d already told her a million times, and we talked about her sending me money in the mail to buy food, which I kept insisting that I don't need, and I hate when people give me money anyways because I’ve been so independent the past 2 years, but she wouldn't believe me, so I gave her my address to send it and now all is well. But now my family is continuing to tell me how ungrateful I am and how tired they are with my attitude, which to this day I still cant figure out what attitude I have other than just trying to be independent and not needing help and also just trying to defend myself whenever they yell at me. I’m to the point of not talking to any of them, once again, and just want to cry because I feel like I’ll never be good enough because I’m not my sister. All I’ve ever heard from both my mom and sister is that I cant handle moving up to a big city (ignore the fact I’ve been spending a lot of time up there lately to visit my boyfriend who just moved up there and can get around and figure things out pretty quickly and I’m smart about everything, rather than going and looking to get murdered or something, and when I went up on my own last weekend, they freaked out because I have a shitty boyfriend who apparently made me walk around Chicago at night by myself, even though I was perfectly fine and knew what I was doing, and wanted proof that he met up with me to walk back to his apartment together). I've also always been told that I’m generally just not smart enough for anything, especially to get a bachelors degree in finance and get internships while in school and later find a job in the city, something that would be really hard to do if I lived in the country like they expect of me. I just don’t know how much more I can handle or what to do at this point. I’m tired of always forgiving them and just getting hurt and disappointed all over again when I thought they’d changed. Do I just ignore them for good this time. Do I only talk to them when they reach out to me first? Do I even try to fix things again? All they do is cause more stress than I need and make me feel worthless. Any advice?"
3njj13,3,2015-10-05,"Me [25 M] with my crush [21 F] of several months, am I reading too much into these moments?",throwaway9866621,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3njj13/me_25_m_with_my_crush_21_f_of_several_months_am_i/,"I must preface this with that the only reason I'm asking if I'm reading too much into these is that my friends tell me I've very bad with picking up signs from women. So I need some 3rd party input on some things.

There are the little things of course: she seems to get excited whenever I'm around, she likes to be close to me whenever possible, and when we talk she looks into my eyes but then constantly looks away. She generally asks me for help with things as well. Not to mention I'll catch her looking at me fairly often. But these obviously could just amount to her being ultra friendly.

During the summer we saw each other on and off but I went on vacation out of state for a few weeks and we didn't see each other. When I came back work was ultra busy, but she hit me up and asked to come by and practice interviewing for an internship. She came by and I helped her. A few days later I found out from a mutual friend that she had gotten the internship a few days before we practiced the interview. Her friend didn't know about the meet up between us.

Her mother already knows quite a bit about me as does her younger brother and her mother seems to go out of the way whenever I see her to ask me a lot of questions. Her younger brother seems to already know a good deal about me, once he even knew what I was planning to do on a weekend excursion. 

On top of all of this when I got back from a business trip and didn't really tell anyone I was going. (I was only gone for 3 days) when I returned she told me that she had missed me and had no idea I was going to be gone for ""so long.""

Am I acting crazy or does she seem interested? Maybe I'm reading too much into this. I could go on about other details but I don't want to bore people. What do you all think? I've been on a few dates in the past few years but I admittedly am an introvert with a low sex drive and I spend most of my free time doing other things. I'm not good with women, I'm not awkward or anything I just don't realize when they're flirting. Anybody care to help me out here?
  
**tl;dr**: I'm bad with picking up on signs but my crush seems to have body language to suggest her attraction not to mention she claims to miss me when I leave for a short while and her family seems to know an abnormal amount about me for a fairly ""casual friend."""

Center for Disaster and Humanitarian Assistance Medicine (CDHAM) 
The CDHAM Program is a US Army initiative that fosters an interagency approach to enhance Partner Nation (PN) disaster preparedness that facilitates long-term recovery, enables governmental self-sufficiency and encourages regional cooperation. Its mission is to assist Combatant Commands, Service Components, and Country Teams in assessing PN disaster preparedness; support development of disaster management plans and facilitate implementation of Interagency events consistent with USG strategies and to encourage PN and Regional resilience to disasters.  The CDHAM Program provides sustainable USG engagements to increase PN and regional capabilities to plan for and respond to disasters without relying on massive and costly international civil-military deployments.  To that end, it establishes rigorous assessment and evaluation processes to ensure stakeholder accountability.   The CDHAM Program places an emphasis on disaster preparedness rather than disaster response and expects to garner significant efficiencies within the Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Response (HADR) mission area in a resource constrained climate.  Increased national and regional resilience to the effects of disasters minimizes the requirement for intrusive civil-military interventions.

Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) (PAID INTERNSHIP)

APPLICATIONS FOR THIS INTERNSHIP ARE HANDLED DIRECTLY THROUGH LLNL POC MR BARRY GOLDMAN.  DO NOT SUBMIT ANY APPLICATIONS TO CADET COMMAND

""LLNL is a Defense and National Security Lab.  Through the Defense Program, LLNL supports the DoD as a preeminent innovative S&amp;T contributor to its national security mission.  LLNL's mission includes bio-security, counterterrorism, defense, energy, intelligence, nonproliferation, science &amp; technology and the weapons &amp; complex integration. This coming summer, I hope to host at least 10 Army ROTC Cadets.  

Salary will range from the students major and years of schooling.  As example, someone starting their junior year in the fall would earn $21/hr if an engineering or computer science major.  All other majors, $17/hr. Occasionally, I can also place social science majors.

An internship is 8 hrs/day and 5 days/wk.  LLNL hosts 400+ upper level undergrads and graduate students.  So the ROTC Intern program is a small program in relation to all the other students we bring to LLNL.  There are optional lectures and tours and networking throughout the summer and there will be a required ROTC lecture series.  During these lectures, cadets will be required to be in uniform but the rest of their stay, we are a civilian facility.  As such, civilian attire is OK the rest of the time.

3nkusf,2,2015-10-05,Diabetes + Gamification,MHatASK,diabetes,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/3nkusf/diabetes_gamification/,"Hello everyone!

I just started an internship at a company which has the intentions to help other companies with planning and self management. Their current applications include an app for homecare and one for the fire department. 


For my internship at this company i need to make an app that motivates diabetics with their daily routine. This will be accomplished by the means of gamification. 

To create an application which suits the needs of diabetics i need some information about the problems and  impediments including the ‘motivation’ and ‘lack of information’. Therefore i wanted to ask you all if i might take away a small bit of your time to answer the following questions.

What are obstacles in your daily life related to your diabetes ?
In which actions you perform every day would you like to have help?
What actions do you feel as troublesome - and which as really annoying?

If you have more suggestions for me, please leave them in a reaction! "
3nlatw,1,2015-10-05,Was manic in the process of getting into an MS in IT. How do I mop up $5k in credit card debt?,crazyGradStudent,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3nlatw/was_manic_in_the_process_of_getting_into_an_ms_in/,"Edit: I actually have bipolar disorder which is stable on medication, but not if I overwork myself, which I was forced to do.

I basically sacrificed everything about my health, body, social life, and finances to get into a master's in IT.

But it was worth it because I found out I got in this week!!! :D

And EVEN BETTER I went to the career fair and am being poached for internships for companies worth $15-$50 billion! I'm not a failure or a phony!

I feel very happy that I have financial security for the future because my undergrad is in the social sciences/humanities so that degree would not have turned a profit whatsoever, and because I was feeling very suicidal and manic but managed to not take any time off or slow down. I was also doing prereqs for two years *hoping* to get in, so it could have all been for nothing. But I did it, yay! My mental health is fine now.

But uhh. Now I have to mop up the mess.

I'm 30lbs heavier, and I'm a very short girl. I needed new winter clothes completely. I managed to break a bunch of shit in my house (agitated/clumsy...). And oh yeah, I gained that weight from eating out almost constantly while studying for finals then the GRE.

Now I have $4k-$5k in credit card debt. I also, however, have a credit score of 750 and I also filled out the form for federal student loans and start in spring. I am 24.

My family pays my tuition and rent but doesn't give me much money for anything besides that. I'm at my internship and my paycheck is ~$500-$750. I know that is a lot since I don't pay rent, utilities, car, or tuition/books but I was just spending like crazy and could only sleep 3 hours a night and was laughing randomly. I'm happy I didn't get fired.

All of it is on a points card from USAA with a 11% APR I've had for 5 years. I paid off my AMEX and always pay off my Double Cash because they have higher rates and I want the cash back. I always pay as much as possible and keep about $100 in my checking. I have never been late on a payment in my entire life. My credit limit is $19,000 so I'm still using &lt;30% of my limit. I put all of the cards in a drawer except my Double Cash. 

I do not have kids or pets and I will get another cheap apt when I get a job. I have an 03 civic with 90k miles which was a gift I'm going to keep as long as possible and is working perfectly now. My ONLY debt is this credit card debt.

Should I take out a federal student loan to reduce interest and pay it back when I graduate? How should I tackle this credit card debt? I am very frugal when I'm not manic.

I apologize if this was too long. I am very long winded, even when I am euthymic. At least I know this is a temporary problem and in the end the mental health and credit card hit was totally worth it.

Thanks! :D"

**7,315 *losers* lovin' that sweet sweet Seattle sound**

This is an sincere apology letter to the mods of /r/Grunge.

Hey Atticus138 &amp; gang, I just wanted to mention I haven't forgotten about /r/grunge and my promise to feature it. I actually wanted to feature it for a few months now. Things just got delayed to extremes over here in SROTD's garageband. The unnamed intern who wanted to originally feature your subreddit, started writing a feature then fashionably rage quit without telling anyone. Which is quite a [*dumb*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lj3bCXViNNM) thing to do. So our hiring policy used to be [*Come as you are*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vabnZ9-ex7o). Since then our hiring policies have become much more stricter. They just don't [*breed*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee6xkwVucIE) good interns like they used to. I swear stressing out on writing this feature myself is gonna end up giving me an [*Aneurysm*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QD0D7IuriWQ).


In all honesty I am *soo* not a good writer for this particular topic let alone any topic. Please forgive me in advance if I don't give your subreddit the respect it deserves. I'm not making excuses. I really was forcefully removed from the genre when I had to move locations to a totally desolate part of the world where grunge did not exist at the time. So the only grunge related music I know on the back of my hand is a few songs from Nirvana.  Sorry for all the lame puns, [*All apologies.*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LFVQpDKHk4). Which I know doesn't do grunge justice.

So I am asking you, no pleading to you and your community. Educate me. Seduce me. [*Rape me*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ax0C6rlo-54) (sorry last one) with that seattle sound I so yearn for. If you haven't heard of grunge... just wow. Go google it or explore /r/grunge with an open mind.

&gt;#1. Tell us a little about yourself!

&gt;&gt;**atticus138** I like music, beer, video games and TV.

&gt;&gt;**oldwhitelincoln** I like good music, compelling movies, and hot women.

&gt;#2. How did you get involved in r/grunge ?

&gt;&gt;**atticus138** I discovered this place through /r/music's ""master list"" of music subreddits a couple years ago. I was born in 81, so I was in junior high and high school when grunge was  in its prime. 

&gt;&gt;**oldwhitelincoln** Was added as a mod by sir /u/atticus138 

&gt;#3. Whats your favorite(s) post so far?

&gt;&gt;**oldwhitelincoln** I was born in 1982 and was a teenager during grunge's heyday.  I like the posts that take me back, but I appreciate most things that get posted!

&gt;#4. What your grunge favorite band? Why?

&gt;&gt;**atticus138** At the risk of sounding cliche here, I have to go with Nirvana. They're the ones who opened my eyes to the genre and absolutely love every single thing I've ever heard from them. STP would probably be 2nd. Core, Purple and Tiny Music are fucking masterpieces IMO.

&gt;&gt;**oldwhitelincoln** Alice In Chains. First heard them in 1992 on the ""Singles"" soundtrack which I had stolen from my older sisters.  Been in love ever since.

&gt;#5. Tell us about your community!

&gt;&gt;**atticus138** This is an easy one: Laid back and easy to get along with. 

&gt;&gt;**oldwhitelincoln** We're all here for the same reason so we get along pretty well!

3nm5zo,7,2015-10-05,Any INTJs dissatisfied with their friendships or very happy ??? Please share your input...,Lancehead_viper,intj,https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/3nm5zo/any_intjs_dissatisfied_with_their_friendships_or/,"Hello everyone !!! This will be my first post on this thread. Please bear with me this is going to be a long post.

Do any of the INTJs (both men &amp; women) here feel that you were not able to connect properly or form strong of friendship during school / college or struggling to make friends even at the workplace. 

I (27M) have couple of friends but don't feel like I have strong bond of friendship with them. At times I feel its more of a business relationship than a fun &amp; healthy friendship where I can talk about anything, make silly jokes,  talk about random topics etc. 

I have segregated below various stages of my life (till now) and how my friendship was with various people.

1.) School: This was what I would call ""dark ages"" for me....always made fun of, bullied again and again, when I asked someone to help me with studies (example: solving difficult problem in maths) they would mock me  and I was all by my self to tackle problem...there was no one whom I could rely on or help me and as a result my parents were unhappy (and often angry) as my grades were falling. Luckily I managed to pass (only god knows how).
Friendships made: There were only a handful of 2-3 friends who helped me. I am in still touch with them.

2.)  College: This stage was where I started changing. From day 1 I decided that whatever happened in school is just a bad dream, now  I will make a fresh start. During all my college semesters I was among top 3, I even topped college semester in my 3rd year. I had made good impression on my professors as well, one of whom helped me get internship in a different city.
Friendships made: In college I was quite studious and serious person, I guess I was one of very few introverts. Majority of people in my college were all ESXX. 
Most of the times I was mocked but never bullied. All the time those ESXX used to tell me "" You need to get OUT in real world and stop reading those books, books are useless !!! books never help in real world""....on and on same bullsh*t  again and again. I can't tell how much I tolerated.
I had only one friend who was ISXX. He was opportunist and often cunning in his ways. He talked to me only when he needed me (week before exams). I never talked to him after I left college.

3.) Post-graduation: By this time I really had become quite confident. I hoped that maybe during MBA I will make strong network of friends who will be useful later on as well, unfortunately my plan failed miserably, although I did well academically.
Friendships made: ESTJ, INFJ and INTP
ESTJ friend - This guy used to play drums, had been part of college band, used to make very good presentations (ofcourse for ESXX people it comes naturally I suppose), though used make insulting comments here and then without realizing how offensive one would feel. One particular instance he told me (in a authoritative tone) ""hey man how can you approach women when you yourself don't know what emotions you have"" (now this was totally incorrect, I rarely showed emotions on face but that didn't mean I was some cold blooded psychopath, it is just that after being mocked and bullied so many times before I had developed a thick shell and as a  result people might see me as serious person with no emotions). Though my INFJ friend somehow knew I was secretive by nature. My ESTJ friend was one of first people in college to get placed in a very prestigious company with good package. He is doing very well in his career, I guess he will be married in a year or two. (No surprises there)
 
INFJ friend: This was one of the best friendship I had till date. He once told me ""You are my alter-ego""....I didn't know how to react...so I asked what makes you say that, he told me our minds function on a very similar level...which was true to some extent...however he used to get very emotional sometimes and those emotions would hold him for couple of days after which he would cool down and come back to his original warm and fun loving personality. He is now a professor and doing quite well, he teaches HR and many other subjects. (Apparently one of his class has all girls and he tells me how often they hit on him) 

INTP friend: This guy was genius in statistics, whether it was regression analysis, hypothesis testing etc he would solve it within few minutes and had quirky humor. One particular instance I had gone to him to understand about certain problem in statistics, he started explaining me and during middle of explanation (out of the blue) he just randomly made some random joke of Shakespeare and started laughing (the joke was NOWHERE related to problem which we were solving).
INTP guy unfortunately didnt get placed in campus placements despite having such brilliant mind, I never understood how did that happen. I told him to go for analytics as he had aptitude for it yet to my surprise he went for HR career. Till now he has changed atleast 4 - 5 jobs, every job he lasted mere 7-8 months. I wondered what went wrong. He described me as ""moody deep thinker and secretive person""...he told me I was similar to raskolnikov (from crime &amp; punishment), whereas my INFJ friend told me I was ""Man on a mission"", infact my INFJ friend wanted to capture me when I was walking towards something.

As for me I got placed just in the nick of time before placement season came close. 

4. Workplace: Well its my second job now, all ESXX people again, always shouting, weekends means only one thing and that is ""BOOZE and PARTY""....I don't drink so my socializing remains restricted to workplace. Its just business relationship with my colleagues, I say hi to them in morning, talk about issues related to work (if the need arises) and then say bye bye when the day is over. 
Friends made: 1-2 people whom I talk to daily but apart from that not much interaction with anybody else.

Sorry people for such long post.....this thing had been inside me for so long I just wanted to get it out of me. Please share your experiences, I really interested to learn and find out is this problem of friendship happening only to me or there are people with bad / negative experiences in friendship.  "

Let's just look at things and break them down for what they are, or aren't

Tanny, our boy the passmaster is taking some heat for the comments he made to some practice squad players. First off, yes that is a pretty douchey thing for Tanny to say. (About the practice squad paycheck) but am I the only one that isn't really upset, nor cares much at all about any of this? Yeah he made a douchey comment to a practice squad player. We don't know the context of the situation. Worst case scenario is Tanny threw a pick to a PS player and that's what he said. Anybody who has played football at any level, even of just the high school level, knows that during any given practice there is always a lot of chirping that goes on. Between any and all of the players. Hell [Cam Newton and Josh Norman got in a full out fight](http://espn.go.com/blog/carolina-panthers/post/_/id/14826/what-happened-with-panthers-surrounding-the-cam-newton-josh-norman-fight) at practice this year because Newton threw him a pick six and they chirped back and forth a little. Chirping happens all the time. God forbid that he be a little frustrated at how the team has looked. The ""Practice Squad Trophy"" comment doesn't stir me one bit. Anyone who has played football at any level knows what I'm talking about when I say there are ""practice all stars"" on every team too. /u/dropthatbass13 had some good insight on one of the other threads about this too. It really isn't that big of deal, yeah me made kind of a dickish comment. Not that much of a story, only a story because the team is not playing well.

As for the man of the hour, Dan Campbell. Dude looks tough as fucking nails as all of us agree. Let's not forget though, Campbell went from being a former player straight to coaching. Spent a year as a coaching intern with us in 2010, and has been out TE's coach ever since. He is only 39, so he is super young. The youngest head coach in the league right now, for a matter of the fact. He has said everything that everyone in this sub has been preaching for quite some time right now. Clearly nobody can question his motivation and passion that he has for this team and his desire to win. Now whether or not that will translate to the X's and O's and wins on the field, who knows. At least he have some fire and emotion on the sidelines now. A true leader. Give the shitty situation he's been put in, and how fast this has all come to him, I don't think any of us can be disappointed in Campbell if this doesn't end well. However there is potential for a turnaround. The players respect him, so he will get more out of them in that sense. They still have all the talent like he talked about in his presser. They still have all the skill that everyone was hyped about. It wont be easy and they don't have time to fuck around, but hey, why not give it a shot?

Fins up boys!"

I am a third-year student with a pretty high GPA and I am worried about declining an offer I have from a national firm. I actually would like to really work for them but I would also love the opportunity to work for a B4.

The national firm started on campus interviews much earlier than anyone and so the offer was sent to me and I have until Friday to sign it. The B4 firms are just starting their interviews, Deloitte being the first one that I have an interview with this week. 

I won't get an offer from any B4 yet and not for a few weeks. However, I don't want to miss this opportunity to intern with the firm if there isn't a good offer from the B4 or the location that I would like.

Should I accept the national offer and perhaps rescind it if I get an offer that I really like from a B4?

Should I continue interviewing even after I sign an offer?

Hope to hear some feedback and experiences that you had.
Thanks!"

3no1b1,2,2015-10-06,My mom died last month (54) &amp; my gf's mom is now nearing her deathbed (44),Adonis25,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3no1b1/my_mom_died_last_month_54_my_gfs_mom_is_now/,"My girlfriend and I met on tinder of all places. But she and I really hit it off at first and fell deeply in love. We met in January of 2014 and started dating in April of 2014. She lived about an hour from me and she moved to Las Vegas to live with her mom for internship and career reasons. I live in northeast Ohio and we've been long distance ever since. With that said, my mom got deathly ill in May of 2014. She had a multitude of diseases, however, these diseases mimicked other ones. Essentially, the doctors couldn't figure out what was wrong with her until it was too late. In January of 2015, right after the best Christmas I've ever had spending with her mom and step dad, my mom slowly lost her ability to walk. At the time I was in college courses full time with work part time. So I was constantly worried about her at work or at school. My dad works a job that he's there for 2 days and home for 2 days so I'd especially worry on days he wasn't there. The day finally came when she completely lost her ability to walk. It was around March of 2015 and I had to carry her up and down the stairs and around the house because she kept falling otherwise. I also had to bathe her. In May of 2015 I had put her in her bathroom and went to make something to eat. She screamed and I ran up to my bathroom and saw that her rectum had fully prolapsed and there was blood and feces all over the floor. I instantly panicked and called my father who rushed home from work. This was first of 4 instances when she was in and out of the hospital from May 2015 to August 2015. She was in and out of nursing homes when she wasn't there. She lost 50 pounds and she was only 145 when she started losing weight. She was in a nursing home at 54 years old and we had her birthday there. Luckily, 2 weeks before she died my dad brought her home to nurse her and take care of her there. Thank God he did because we spent my birthday with her. However, on August 28th two weeks after my birthday, she passed. I watched my brilliant, loving, and incredible mother fall apart. However, I was lucky enough to get to her 10 minutes before she died in the hospital. So I was able to say my goodbyes, but I watched my mom take her last breath at 54.

Now, literally 5 weeks later my girlfriend's mom is going through a similar situation. She was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis 3 years ago. However, they told her it was hepatitis initially. It got worse and now her liver is the size of a baby in her stomach. All of her organs are shutting down. Her kidneys, bladder, heart in some instances, and she's out of it half the time just like my mom was. She's 44. I haven't even had time to grieve over my mom and now her mom is dying. The worst part is I know what she's going through and that makes it hurt even worse. I wouldn't cast this pain on my worst enemy let alone the love of my life. My heart breaks for her and it's still broken from my mom. I don't even know what to do. On top of that I don't have very many funds to pull from to go see her because remember she's still in Vegas and I in Ohio. On top of that I'm in my second to last semester in college full time plus I work part time. I'm going to be there for her no matter what but this is going to make my life even that much harder.

Needless to say, I'm beyond depressed. If I didn't believe in having a relationship with God, I wouldn't be here right now. But I know I have to be there for her. I just came here for a place to vent. I don't know why any of his is happening. As the days go by it gets harder and harder. It's really hard to stay positive."

I would prefer to continue with school if possible just to avoid having gap years, however I'm not completely sure if I would want to continue with my field of study.

Classes I've taken include basic chem/physics/bio/math series, geology classes (structure/sed pet/field...etc) and a few computer based courses (intro c++, matlab, remote sensing)

I've been currently looking at geochemistry, chemistry, and material science programs, however I'm not sure if it would even be possible for me to go into chemistry and mat sci fields. Geochemistry is my current option because I have been researching in a geochemistry lab for a while. I would much prefer to switch into material science as it seems like the perfect balance between fun science and useful in industry.

Is there anything I can do to check if I would even be an eligible applicant?"

3npgl6,4,2015-10-06,Please double-check my student loan repayment plan,spoonraker,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3npgl6/please_doublecheck_my_student_loan_repayment_plan/,"I'll start with the basics...

* Dual-income, no kids, cheap cost of living in the midwest
* Combined income of ~$100k
* We rent an apartment for ~$900/mo. Very few other bills beyond your basics: utilities, internet (no cable), phones,  netflix/hulu, food for us and our dog
* Currently ~$77k in student loans, which *might* go up to close to $90k before graduation (final year of school is currently underway)
* None of the loan balance is due until August of 2016 (still in school until then)
* Absolutely no other debt. No car payments, zero credit card balances.
* We already have a large amount of liquid cash saved up for an emergency fund or whatever else we may need it for, around $35k as of right now
* I have a retirement account that I started very young which has a &gt; $60k balance 
* I dropped out of college and started working very young, all the student loan debt is my wife's
* Until this year we've been living almost entirely off my income. My wife was fortunate enough to get a paid internship for the final year of her program, so just a few months ago her income went from ~$10k to ~$42k. This is included on the ~$100k combined income. So just recently we're making more money than ever and the extra income still doesn't feel real. She's only received a few pay checks thus far.


So here's what we're thinking...

We have no plans to let lifestyle inflation occur. We plan to continue living exactly how we do, and focus our combined income on paying the student loans as quickly as possible. 

The large student loan balance is broken up into numerous smaller loans. All of them are Direct Loans, about half subsidized and half un-subsidized. (ok there is *one* private loan through our bank with a $10k balance, but all the rest are Direct loans) The balances vary from $2.5k to $10k, interest rates vary from 3.4% to 6.8% (most are in the 5-6.8 range), and there are about 12 loans total.

My wife works at a school, so I've been told we are eligible for Public Service Loan Forgiveness, but after looking into it a bit I don't think it sounds like a good option for us. I was told we could consolidate all the federal loans, probably wind up with a lower payment and a much longer repayment term, and after 10 years the remaining balance would be forgiven. However, I just don't think these numbers work out well for us. We'd still pay a sizable amount of money in those 10 years, and the interest would be insane due to the longer term, plus we'd still pay heavy income taxes on the forgiven balance after 10 years. The payments on the standard plan without changing our loan structure at all is well within our means, and we plan to greatly exceed that amount and pay them off early anyway.

Does anybody have any thoughts on loan forgiveness versus just buckling down and paying them off as quickly as possible? We really value just getting out of debt quickly, because the long term goal is to be debt free and own a home. I'd really rather not have a student loan payment *and* a mortgage unless the forgiveness route really works out in our favor. Especially since the debt only lowers our home purchasing power (not that we plan on buying a crazy expensive house, we just hate debt).

If we go the route of just paying the loans off as quickly as possible, my understanding is that we want to target the un-subsidized loans first, because those are accruing interest right now while the subsidized ones are not. Probably want to target that one private loan too, depending on the interest rate. So basically, un-sub and private first, subsidized last, go in order of greatest to least interest rate. That sound about right?

Here's another question: since my wife is still in school until August of next year but is fortunate enough to already have a real income, would we be better served by starting to make payments on the loans right now before anything is actually due? Or would we be better off just saving up a big pile of money to throw at the loans once they actually become due? Does direct loans offer discounts to people who are willing to just throw down a huge pile of cash to pay off loans quickly? 

Does any of this plan make sense? We have tried extremely hard to save money and live modestly and I think we've done a good job, we just value advice when it comes to the fine details of repayment now that it's actually coming down to crunch time.

Thanks in advance to anyone who read this and takes the time to reply. Ask any questions necessary if something isn't clear."
3npmdp,9,2015-10-06,Accountant here (CPA in training) looking for advice to bring in extra income.,boseballa2187,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3npmdp/accountant_here_cpa_in_training_looking_for/,"Hey All,

So I have been thinking recently about ways to bring in extra cash utilizing my skills and strengths in accounting. I have a few ideas, but was wondering if anybody in a similar situation would have anything to offer that I maybe did not think of.

To give a little background, I am finally at a place in my life that I can breathe (not being in school, working and internships etc.) I would like to take advantage of this new found time to explore other ways to bring in income. Investing, emergency funds, retirement is all taken care of, the biggest reason I would like to do this is to pay off the almost $80k in student loans we have between the two of us so we can go on to buy a house, have kids, etc. 

I have thought of the obvious options which I will label with their pros and cons. Like I said any advice or ideas would be greatly appreciated. 

I currently have a full time position 8 - 4 which allows me to be home by 4:30. 

1.) Personal Income Tax Service - I currently help select family and friends with their taxes. Benefits include: fairly easy work, not too time consuming, Apartment complex would allow me to advertise and distribute flyers to residents in their mail box come tax time. Downside: Cyclical, I haven't received my CPA as of yet which means I would have to take the IRS certification course. (time and money)

2.) Personal Budgets - I am very good at budgeting and anything to do with personal finances, I currently help select friends and family keep on top of their finances, save, pay down debt etc. Benefits: I LOVE doing this kind of stuff, In demand year round. 
Downside: It is hard to overcome the trust barrier for people to open up about their personal finances. 

3.) Small Business Planning - I currently have two friends who I help monitor their business finances and such. Benefits: Again I love doing this, in demand year round. Downside: Area I live in (Research Triangle, NC) is more catered to big corporate businesses. People feel more confident when you have a CPA certification which I do not possess yet.

I'm 19 and have been working for the same company(300 employees) since I was 17 in my junior year of high school. I started off as a part time intern making $8.5/hr working 3.5 hours during the school day 5 days a week. I had a slight hour and wage increase at the start of my senior year ($9.5/hr 5 hrs/day). After I graduated from high school I was brought on full time (40 hours a week, $32.5k USD a year before taxes in salary, 116 hours of PTO/yr, 401k, 4k/yr tuition reimbursement) I live in a very small Wisconsin town where the cost of living is quite low. 

I have dealt with stress and depression my whole life and recently I have started noticing myself slacking more and more at work and I think that my boss is starting to notice the quality of my work and the quantity of my work dwindling. I know that I am extremely lucky to have this job but right now I have so much on my mind that I cannot focus at work and am worried that I may be let go. I have recently started lifting a lot and going to the gym has really helped me deal with a lot of the depression in my life but it still looms on me heavily. 

I am wondering how acceptable it is to ask your employer for 2-4 months of UNPAID leave? I don't want to quit this job as it is probably the best opportunity I have ever gotten in life and I used to really enjoy it. I feel if I had 2-4 months to just deal with my personal demons I could come back and be a FAR better employee again.

EDIT: I am not really looking to attend any 4 year universities as my history in the academic world is abysmal and I do not think I would be able to get into a very good school nor do I think I would be able to perform well if I did. I would perhaps give tech school a shot though.

EDIT 2: Thank you everyone for the replies all of this advice has been very helpful! "

I'm a master student in bioinformatics in France (the equivalent of a Msc in the US I guess). As I have to do a 4/5 months internship in april, I'm starting to give some thoughts about it. I'd like to work in industry, on an interesting topic (NGS in a biotech company would be an absolute dream!), and possibly in a foreign country.


I was wondering, what are the bioclusters around the world ?
After a quick google search, I came up with pretty big names, but if I could have your input on the topic, that would be great! So far I came up with :

* US : San Francisco / San Diego / Thousands Oaks / Boston
* Switzerland : the Biovalley, Geneva and the Basel area

Not sure about the next ones:

* Canada: Not sure about this one, but the Toronto area seems to host quite a lot of biotech / pharma companies.
* China: Shanghai?
* India: Hyderabad?
* Singapore?
* What about other countries like UK, Norway or Sweden, Australia?

Thanks for the help!"

I am searching through a lot of companies trying to find ones that will either hire security interns or hiring software developer interns at a security company. I've seen the hiring thread and it is abysmally small.

I've applied to Cisco, PA, FireEye, Tenable, and some other lesser known companies (avoiding most govt. jobs).

If anyone knows more companies that are relatively large or well known that are hiring interns please drop a comment. 

I don't see very much internship related talk on this sub compared to cscareerquestions (although size plays a big role). asknetsec has the same problem discussing internships. For instance, a post like this https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2j47v9/2015_megalist_summer_computer_science_internships/ would be out of this world if it were relating to security positions."

3nqw0o,2,2015-10-06,I need help,TDKshorty,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3nqw0o/i_need_help/,"I've suffered from depression in the past, it was pretty bad my junior year of high school but I've maintained it well through healthy eating and exercise habits and writing and creating art.  

I've been severely depressed since the last week of August and I've had suicidal thoughts about three times in the last two weeks. My emotions feel so out of control and I feel so hopeless. I need to do something about it or I'm not going to make it.  

I don't know where to turn or what to do. I tried to book an appointment for counseling at my college, but there's a waiting-list.  I'm currently unemployed and without health insurance, so I can't afford a doctor, and I honestly don't want to be medicated.  

I've been to the counseling center before, two years ago but that was due to anxiety and mood-swings; I was getting mad and frustrated over stupid little things like being late or traffic and they sound little but when it's a source of stress and it becomes part of your daily life, your life is stressful.  

I've lost all interest in basically everything- I don't play, write or practice music anymore, I can never decide on a movie to watch; they all seem so uninteresting to me, I still workout but it's hard because I feel so good afterwards and then I feel awful because I felt so bad all day that it makes things worse and then that little endorphin boost is gone when I wake up in the morning.  

I lost my job right as soon as the depression was setting it; it was my first job in a while that I felt comfortable at, I had alot of anxiety at my old job, being around people and that started to become part of my daily life to the point where going to the bank or the grocery was a huge ordeal.  

Then I started working out frequently in April of this year, and the anxiety and doubt all went away and I was confident and happy and outgoing.  But something happened, I think it started with my job that I was so excited to have gotten- I wasn't particularly good at my job, no matter how hard I tried, and after 2 months, I was let go. So leading up to that, I knew I wasn't doing well and it was very frustrating and I feel like I wasn't able to translate that from being ""a failure"" to being ""not meant to be"", so I was pessimistic as opposed optimistic.  

So I just didn't feel good about myself because I was failing on a daily basis and struggling just to do my job.  

So I started getting depressed, it just kind of happened, and I felt hopeless about school and work and my future and I remember I got really drunk that last weekend of August- and I make it a deal to not watch porn- and I did watch porn and that further lowered my-self esteem and then I let my eating habits get out of control- I ate everything in site.  

And it's just been a downward spiral since then. I'm not watching porn, but I'm struggling with food and I stopped drinking for a while, but I'm drinking again, but moderating myself.  

I really, really need to find a job but I just can't. I know I'm not in the right place, mentally to be able to work- I feel like I should be excited about getting a job and I'm not and it just feels so pointless.  I've applied to alot of places and none have responded, so that's not encouraging and there's just a sense of dread when I think about working somewhere- doing things and being around people. Which used to make me so happy. Working! Doing! Meeting new People! It was awesome! Now it feels like the heaviest weight in the world.  

I think the worse part about this is I feel like I'm wearing a sign that says ""I'm depressed"" so everyone knows it and I feel so ashamed, like everyone knows what I'm thinking and is judging me all the time.  

I just need to get away from everything in my life right now. I need a new one.  


I will also say that it was really bad two weeks ago- I skipped class and my internship and stayed home all day and watched porn again and ate bad food and did nothing. When my girlfriend got home from work, who is an angel by the way, and when I'm around her my day is instantly better- even when I was happy, she would come home and it felt like there were all these troubles that I didn't know I had and she took them all away. I'm beyond blessed to have her in my life. Anyways, she comes home, and I couldn't say anything to her and I just broke down and cried and cried and cried and I couldn't look her in the eyes and she was so scared and worried because she thought everything was normal because I'm good at hiding that side of myself. And after about 30 minutes I was able to bring myself to tell her I was depressed.  
I thought admitting it would make things better but nothing has changed.  I'm not sure where to go.  

Also, depression sucks, because I know I said I was feeling bad about being bad at my job and then getting fired and then drinking and indulging,, Those things aren't why I'm depressed...this feeling has no source, reason or rhyme- it just is and does as it wants. It just happens to feed off of those behaviors and thoughts so those only make it worse.

3nqxcf,2,2015-10-06,My current state,realizationishard,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3nqxcf/my_current_state/,"Cold breezes and changing leaves. It was a boring summer, but nothing that made me feel too out of place. I was comfortable there, doing nothing of importance, playing video games. All of my my goals and aspirations from the semester are no longer important, of course I would still love to study the things that I love, but it is just too much energy, too much of a hassle.

I am feeling a little bored. Maybe I would like to do something a little more with my day. Make some money or even meet some new people. So I apply for a few jobs and internships that will help me pass the time. But I get no calls. So what do I do? I sit around, doing nothing in particular. Just playing video games. 

A month passes by, nothing is changing. I would really like to see some of the people that I know and say hi, so I send them a message. They seem as excited as I am, and when I ask if they would like to go out and get something to eat, they just stop talking. I wait, and I wait. This is the highlight of my day. Waiting. I have heard all of the lectures before, about being a man and how to handle a situation with dignity, but this silence seems to cut me a little deeper, deeper, deeper. I should focus on something else, but there is nothing else. The only thing that I have is my thoughts, video games, and my lost ambitions.
	
The responses either never come, or are them saying that they are too busy. I wish I could be busy... it just seems like they are not interested in hanging out or spending time with me, so I withdraw a little more from them, from everyone. 
	
I get the results in the mail. I made Dean’s List. This is a first. My foreign language proficiency score came back. I am one of the best in the history of my university. This is me right? An academic, fluent foreign language speaker. I can fix any problem as long as I put my mind to it. Except for that one thing. Me. 
	
I share the news of my accomplishments with my family. My father is the most enthusiastic, but everyone else says “That is to be expected, you are one of us.” Nothing that I do can be for just me, I feel like I have been given all of the hard work, but robbed of the reward.

Another month goes by, I am no longer getting invited out to parties or to events. But this doesn’t bother me, at least I still have my video games. I am even getting really good at them. I started from the bottom and am getting closer to the top of the rankings. This is worthwhile right?

It is true that proximity breeds contempt. I wish my mom would just leave the house so I could be alone. She always finds a way to be upset with me, even for the smallest things. She is the type of person who yells at me for not rinsing a dish, then come to realize it was her dish. But don’t expect any apologies. I haven’t gotten a single one in my entire life that wasn’t rescinded the next moment. Not even for slapping me as a toddler, calling me a rag boy when I was 8, or a male chauvinist pig when I was 9. Her excuse? My memory is too good. My memory says when I asked for food besides ramen noodles you told me that “you were not legally required to provide me with anything else other than the bare minimum.” Maybe this is where I get my sense of identity. Maybe I think I am inherently worthless. Maybe if I play some video games I can ignore her and my thoughts. The pain goes away.

Another month passes by. How many more of these do I have to endure? I want to go back to school. At least there I could spend the entire day studying and meeting new people. I found out I was offered an internship, but they could never get a hold of me. Why? Because their information was marked as SPAM on my google account. I won’t make that mistake again.

School is starting again. I am finally a senior in college. It is time to get up earlier than 2pm. I even found a job on campus that would allow me to earn money and study at the same time. I could even afford to take a girl out on a date. 

Things are strange. I have a really hard time focusing or retaining information. My memory is getting a little fuzzy. Things are not as easy to remember anymore. But I suppose that this should just be considered age. It was bound to happen sometime that my memory faded, even though I am only 24 years old. 
	
It is October 6th today. I feel like I am out of control of my own body, like I am just going along for the ride. I sit down for class and everything goes in one ear and out the other. I am working. Maybe it would help me to get my mind out on paper so that I can deal with what is going on. The tears start to flow. I have to repress them. I have to maintain a strong reputation. What if someone sees me?  

It is time that I came to terms with what is really going on in my life. Video games are not my liberation, they are my crutch and my blinders. They have limited me from being able to get out of a bad situation, and stopped me from seeing the reality of what has been going on around me. How long has this been going on?
	
I needed to get my emotions out, and this prompt has just served as the medium for that. I am putting it here so that maybe someone can provide some insight into things or maybe even in their own lives. I will be fine, I always eventually am.
In order to avoid pitfalls like this in the future I have applied for 30+ internships and jobs for my next summer. I have applied to graduate school outside of my home state, as well as scholarships that would help me stay out of debt. Getting out of state will be important because I have a toxic family."

3nrczs,294,2015-10-06,Devnote Tuesday: Announcing Kerbal Space Program 1.0.5!,KasperVld,KerbalSpaceProgram,https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/3nrczs/devnote_tuesday_announcing_kerbal_space_program/,"Hello everyone!  
  &amp;nbsp;  
We bet the title of this week’s devnotes caught your attention, and for a good reason!  
  &amp;nbsp;  
Those of you who have been following our devnotes over the past few weeks will have noticed that we ran into more work than we initially anticipated with the Unity 5 update. As we continued with the work it became clear that some things would be done on schedule while the engine update seemed to be in an eternal state of “just one or two more weeks”. This past week then, our production team - Ted and Max (Maxmaps) - sat down with everyone involved: developers, executive producers, artists, community people, and discussed the possibility of releasing the complete features sooner, in a separate update. That update, is Kerbal Space Program 1.0.5.  
  &amp;nbsp;  
What then will be included in update 1.0.5?  
  &amp;nbsp;  
Contextual Contracts by Brian (Arsonide)  
&gt;Contextual contracts aims to turn contracts into a more cohesive experience. To accomplish this a new system was created that detects and creates contracts for existing vessels. The more spacecraft are in orbit, the higher the chances are you will run into one of these new contracts.  
  &amp;nbsp;  

Thermal Improvements by Bob (Roverdude)  
&gt;Radiators, the ISRU and RTGs are all getting a bit of attention from Bob! Notably, the radiators can now be hotter than the parts they're cooling, allowing for active refrigeration, the ISRU's core now heats separately from its skin, and the RTGs now generate appropriate amounts of heat (though we cannot recommend using them as heaters).  
  &amp;nbsp;  

New, and Overhauled Parts by Chris (Porkjet)  
&gt;We already showcased a few of the parts that Chris has been working on lately, namely a Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) analogue, an overhauled Mk1 Cockpit, overhauled versions of the Basic Jet Engine, Turbo Jet Engine, Mk1 Fuselage, Mk1 Structural Fuselage and Mk1 Intake. These will be included in 1.0.5.  
  &amp;nbsp;  

Many bugfixes by Nathan (NathanKell) and the other developers  
&gt;NathanKell and the other developers have fixed dozens of bugs that we can include in this update, with the ever invaluable help of the QA Team in triaging, reproducing and fix-testing bugs. The main focus of these fixes are the thermal systems. We’ve included a full list [on the forums](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/356-Announcing-Kerbal-Space-Program-1-0-5).  
  &amp;nbsp;  

This week we’ve started QA testing different parts of the update already, and we hope to give you a better estimate of a release relatively soon based on how smoothly this process goes.  
  &amp;nbsp;  
Of course, work on the 1.1 update also continues: Felipe (HarvesteR) has focused on the flight interface, and also changed the workflow a little bit: instead of trying to get through all of the UI, he’s going through all of the overhauled bits which have been started, but were still pending revisions. That’s grown into quite a large list, and it’s become critical that any interface work that has been started gets finished, rather than keep on going and starting new things while leaving a trail of loose ends.  
  &amp;nbsp;  
That means that currently Felipe is going over everything that’s already been moved over to the new user interface, and making sure it’s ready to go. That is taking quite a good deal of time and effort, not only because of the amount of work that needs doing, but also because the bar is set very high: this isn’t a new piece of content we are adding, it’s a revision of a very large, very established part of the game that has had years of polishing and bug fixing done to it. The minimum acceptable standard of quality is the same level it was at before.  
  &amp;nbsp;  
Felipe also mentioned that this week has been a good opportunity to go over areas of the game that haven’t been visited in a while. He’s added a few new things here and there, whenever the opportunity arose. For instance, since the addition crew roles and levels, we’ve wanted to add a way to display the role and experience level of a crewmember on the main interface. The role and level of crewmembers is now displayed when hovering over their faces, provided it’s a career game (where roles are relevant).  
  &amp;nbsp;  
More good news is that with the focus changing from completing the whole user interface overhaul to just completing the already-overhauled segments, the amount of work needed for the user interface work to be ready to integrate with the main development branch is greatly reduced, and we can then add in all the other parallel features that are being developed such as the KSPedia which Mike (Mu) has completed this week. The only thing left at the moment is compiling the help screens which will make use of this new system.  
  &amp;nbsp;  
With the work on KSPedia done, Mike has updated the PartTools in preparation for 1.0.5. This is a relatively minor update, but a more interesting one is planned for 1.1 For update 1.0.5 the new PartTools will give modders the ability to use any shader built into the game, and also allows them to create an asset bundle containing shaders (with an extension of .shaders), which the game will load as a normal asset and can then be used in mods! Unfortunately, until the Unity 5 patch hits, these asset bundles will have to be built in Unity 4 which itself requires a Pro license to do.  
  &amp;nbsp;  
Creating a new tweening controller to handle movable user interface elements was on this week’s task list for Jim (Romfarer). Initially the controller will be used by staging to move the list elements into place. In the new Unity interface the size and position of list elements are handled by their own internal controllers so once an item is in such a list, it can’t be moved. As a result a lot of smoke and mirrors are involved in making it look like those elements are moving.  
  &amp;nbsp;  
For example, in the simplest case, you pick up a stage group. In order to make the list move fluidly in to close the gap of the element you just removed, a special invisible list element is placed where the element you removed was. Immediately it starts resizing until the height becomes zero and it destroys itself. While the resizing element is in there, the indexes of the stage groups does not match the indexes in the list. And this is what the tweening controller does best, figuring out what is where and where it ought to be as well.  
  &amp;nbsp;  
Daniel (danRosas) made some changes to the Kerbal rig for the animations. A small revision of the mouth made it easier to move the mouth around. The mouth is now a joint based rig, whereas before the revision it was blendshape/curves oriented, which prevented the animations from being imported into Unity. The joint based system will allow these Kerbal characters to work inside the Unity engine.  
  &amp;nbsp;  
After his fixes for the 1.0.5 update were complete Nathan (NathanKell) has focused on the bug fixes that will come in the Unity 5 update. Some of these are very infamous, such as launch clamps following the rocket, airbrakes that can’t have their action group changed, and various bugs related to the claw. Last week, a technical question related to the RequestResource system was asked, and it so happens that Nathan has also been looking into this for a while now:  
  &amp;nbsp;  
&gt;“Now, as is fairly well-known (and was mentioned in the question I want to respond to), that system trawls the entire vessel (if ALL_VESSEL or STAGE_PRIORITY_FLOW) or crossfeed-connected parts (if STACK_PRIORITY_SEARCH) each time a request is made of a part. Now obviously that’s less than optimal. However, it’s done for a reason: we can’t just naively cache all available resources, because at any moment you might decouple, or dock (or go KABOOM) or even you might just toggle the flow state on a resource tank. That could add a resource to the list of resources available, or it could remove it. Further, there can’t just be one cache in the case of STACK because that is request-location-dependent. There are ways to do this based on listening for events, and multiple caches--and the new VesselModule system introduced in 1.0 will help immeasurably--but it’s not an easy thing we can just slap in. We’ll keep looking into it, however.”
  &amp;nbsp;  

On the non-development side of things we’ve learned that Kasper (KasperVld) had a great time at ESA’s OpenESTEC event, meeting industry people and representatives from organizations we’ve worked with over the past few years. Best of all, he came home with three posters signed by ESA astronauts that we have yet to figure out what to do with. Rest assured that we will make you work for them. He also asked us to remind the university students reading this that the ESA Moon Challenge is still open to interested students, but that the application period will end later this week. Read more on [their Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/ESAMoonChallenge).  
  &amp;nbsp;  
On Monday we were blown off our feet when people poked us about an [internship position](https://cnes.fr/en/les-ressources-humaines-du-cnes/modelisation-de-systemes-spatiaux-sous-kerbal-space-program-2016pa2) that has become available at CNES, the French space agency. They’re looking for a student intern who can model their future concepts into Kerbal Space Program, and make videos for the communications department. Not even an hour after that, we learned that the Paris based Exploradôme interactive museum will be holding a KSP event tomorrow.  
  &amp;nbsp;  
Finally, Andrea (Badie) and Kasper have been making solid progress on the media group applications, and have assessed nearly all the applicants now. Once everything is done later this week they’ll be sending everyone who applied an email with the results.  "
3nrn00,3,2015-10-06,I [20F] feel like I'm about to jump off the deep end. How can I keep myself under control?,emtpyness,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3nrn00/i_20f_feel_like_im_about_to_jump_off_the_deep_end/,"I don't know where to go to for this, but I can't keep it bottled up any longer. I don't even know where to start. I apologize for the length. 

I am currently a junior at a prestigious university studying a comm major that I realize I do not feel passionate about. I am also in an internship that I realize I have absolutely no interest in, and makes me really reconsider whether I want to stay in my major and go into that particular field. Despite all the fun I've had in my college experience so far, I really regret going into college straight out of high school with no real direction in mind. I feel like at this point, it is too late to change my major as I'm halfway done with my education. Changing my major could also affect my scholarship, which is the only way I'm able to even go to this school. 

I also cannot bear to disappoint the people I love, especially my parents. My parents are so proud of where I'm going and think I'm heading in a great career path. They've been so amazing and supportive to me not only for my education but for everything in my life. We definitely haven't lived the most comfortable life, and they've made such huge sacrifices to get us to where we are today. I think if I quit now, it would crush them, and everything I've done so far will be for nothing.  

If I were to learn and do anything, it would be something in early childhood education, nonprofit, or social work. But from everything I've read and researched, careers in these fields are not easy and are not paid well. With a career, there's always an issue of whether to pursue something you are passionate about vs. something that is stable. I've always gotten mixed advice about this, so this makes me more hesitant about what step I should take. 

I think another one of my main issues is homesickness. I love all the people I've met here, but my boyfriend, friends, and family are all there and I miss them more than anything. Sometimes, all I want to do to just transfer back to my hometown and go to college there, but I feel that is such a waste of my parents' money, especially when I'm more than halfway done with school. And if I defer a year, I 10000% know that I will never want to go back to school. 

Overall, I just feel stuck. I already know from typing this that I'm being indecisive and making a lot of excuses. But I'm just so terrified that I will fail at whatever at do. There are so many times when I just lose all confidence in myself and don't think I'm good enough or smart enough to do anything. I see all my peers around me so passionate about what they're learning, so determined to go after what they want to do, and they're so, so intelligent. I envy them. I know that they'll go far in whatever they pursue, but my future is so unclear. 

I have thought about counseling, but I don't know if I can even look someone in the eye and really talk to someone about this. I am a very sensitive person and a big crybaby, so every time I even attempt to talk about any issues, I just cry and shut down. Currently breaking down as I type this. I don't know if this is even a valid issue or if I'm just being a weak, pathetic person. 

Furthermore, I feel so guilty about everything I'm feeling. I am too ashamed to talk to my parents, boyfriend, or friends about any of this. They have enough to worry about as it is, and I am a waste of time. I have a very privileged life and a wonderful support system, so how could I even have anything to complain about? I am really grateful to have such wonderful family, boyfriend, and friends in my life, to be able to get a higher education, to be able to have an internship that pays even though I don't like it. Every day I try to remind myself of how great my life is. I try to throw myself into learning new things and be involved and at least attempt to be passionate about what I'm learning in my major. But then I come home and just fall apart. I've cried at least five times a week since the semester has started. I've always been an optimistic person, but that person is quickly disappearing. 

So I guess I'm asking, how can I deal with this guilt am I feeling? How can I stop feeling stuck? How can stop being so afraid of uncertainty? 

**tl;dr**: Fear of the uncertain future, guilt, homesickness, low confidence, etc. are paralyzing me. I am wondering how to get my emotions under control. "
3nrucy,5,2015-10-06,"M4F Prompts historical, Fantastical, and Mundane. A few to choose from.",ElFabio,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3nrucy/m4f_prompts_historical_fantastical_and_mundane_a/,"Hello DPP, I couldn't quite settle on what I was in the mood for today, so I decided to throw out on some options to choose from. Or, if you have some differing ideas, I'd love to hear those too.

First I want to get likes and dislikes out of the way, which will be pretty quick.

Likes: bimbofication, impregantion/breeding, creampies, cheating, light noncon/dub con, fantasy, sci-fi, history, rough sex, soft sex, romance, light ageplay.

Dislikes: bathroom stuff, blood, excessive violence, bestiality.

Now,  I can write in either first or third person, so I leave that up to your preference, though I do like detail and punctuation. Quotation marks to denote speech, that sort of thing. I don't need huge, long multi-paragraph replies, sometimes the occasional short reply is inevitable.

So, the prompts!

The Warbride (Historical)

War feeds on the young. It takes romanticized visions, youthful feelings of immortality, and national pride, ships them over land and sea, and grinds them together into shattered illusions and doom.

But, out of such darkness, passion, life and love can bloom. Be it two young bodies seeking comfort from each other in the dark, or two halves finding their other part, when they'd otherwise remain distant.

In every war the US has fought in the 20th and 21st century, men have left bachelors, and returned husbands... and often fathers the question is, when we set our story? During World War 2? Korea or Vietnam, our more clandestine operations in Latin America?

One thing I think would be interesting would be add some raceplay, maybe the American soldier and young Asian woman with traditional parents? Investigating the clash of two cultures?

The Wild Man

It is the latter days of the nineteenth century, the industrial revolution is moving forward full steam, old ideas of mysticism and miracles being rolled back by the advance of science and technology. The world still has it's mysteries though, uncharted islands, the mysterious interior of the vast continent of Africa still greatly unknown. It is here we tell our story.

In the depths of the Jungle a family of explorers was lost. The parents succumbing to predation, but their son, miraculously survived. He grew to the age of manhood, staking out his dominion over the jungle beasts, the dark mass of trees and vines, a foreboding mystery to most... was his kingdom.

Of course now, as money becomes king in this bold, industrialized world, there are men who will take those with money to see the untamed wilds, and this is how you and the wild man come to meet.

Perhaps you are a young lady of European aristocracy, or the treasured only daughter of an American industrialist, but you and a gathering of your similarly high-status friends chartered this sight seeing adventure.

But taking a small canoe up the river... catastrophe strikes. It is true, the guide had a gun. That didn't help him when the crocodile capsized the boat. After that, it was pure chaos... you barely remembering, just struggling to get to shore in your dress... the panicked sounds of the others on the boat... then nothing.

When you awoke, it was to a crackling fire, a lean, masculine shape sitting nearby. As you sat up, he stood, looking down. He wasn't like the men at the parties or country clubs back home. He stood tall, broad shouldered, powerfully muscled from years climbing and hunting and fighting the dangerous beasts of his home. A thick mane of hair tumbling past his shoulders, with a strong jaw, and light blue eyes, striking in skin tanned a warm bronze by the sun.

This wasn't the sort of man you'd been told to find attractive, you had been groomed to marry a smooth, sleek gentleman, with fine clothes and soft hands... but something about this man awakened a new feeling... a deep, primal need, an aching emptiness between your legs, and the look in this mans eyes suggested desire as well...

A Marriage of Convenience (Historical or Fantasy)

For too long have our houses feuded, a bitter struggle for dominance over the land as the kingdom to your west fell to men from across the sea, a new and martial people, who moved out from their conquests subjugating all in their path... until meeting your people.

Now, our fathers grow weary of seeing their sons and their peoples sons come back carried on their shields... so a compromise is made. A so of his kingdom shall marry a daughter of yours. Together they shall be installed over the contested lands to start a new kingdom, buffering the two rival empires.

(We can take a historical approach with this, setting it in medieval Europe with some detail tweaks depending on the era, or set it in an entirely fictional setting.)

The Homewrecker

Maybe you're a rival of my wife, maybe you're the girl next door, or a new intern at work, looking to bag a handsome and successful man, and you don't care that he's already married (or maybe taking what belongs to someone else is the thrill?)

All that matters is you decided that I was wasted on my wife. A wife who doesn't like the attention you've given me, and likes even less how clearly I enjoyed it. So, you decide to get your legs around me, and take me away from her. You'll show me how much better you are, and you'll do it by giving me what my wife hasn't been able to.

You see, I want a family, and she and I have tried. Unfortunately, she's been... unsuccessful. Why don't you step in and do what she can't?

3ns28x,2,2015-10-06,This back pain is ruining my life (entire back),liferuiningbackpain,backpain,https://www.reddit.com/r/backpain/comments/3ns28x/this_back_pain_is_ruining_my_life_entire_back/,"Hi,
I'm turning to this forum because I honestly believe the problem is to the point that there might not be a solution. If you stick with me and read my issue, I really do appreciate it. 

I'm 17 now. My pain started at age 16, in May of this year (~6 months). I had begun going to the gym September of last year, and been lifting weights very frequently, and had absolutely no problem/pain in doing so for 8 months until the pain started, but I'm including this in case it helps anyone pinpoint the root of the problem. 

 So, one day I woke up with pain. A dull ache in my right shoulderblade. I didn't give it much thought; sore muscle, for sure. Except, it continued. A week into this hell, I gave in and got a deep tissue massage. It helped.... for about two hours. The pain kept spreading at this point; I had a coding internship in the summer and was thus in a desk for a long time every day. I had to stop going to the gym, I couldn't bear the pain. I was super irritable, wanting to get home and just lie in bed for the rest of the day - the most miserable summer I've ever had. I went to an orthopedist family friend, who didn't give much thought to it and prescribed me metaxalone. Took metaxalone, didn't do jack crap. At this point, pain was throughout ENTIRE back, but by this I mean at different time intervals it will be upper back pain, and other times it will be lower back pain. The guy brushed it off and didn't really care, so I decided with my parents to see a Chiro. Chiro gave me all these false promises - ""oh, why even go to the others, you should've just come to me"" he did his adjustments, felt better for 15 minutes... then back to normal. I probably went to this chiro about 10 times. I totally regret it. I have no doubt it made the pain worse. I'm not in a constant need to crack every part of my back, my neck can't move without cracking. I tried three other Chiros, ~10 sessions of physical therapy, bought electrodes, used every day, etc. At this point I've been to probably 12 different doctors and we've spent thousands of dollars and I came to the realization that the pain is at its root myofascial, that it's muscular and that it was ORIGINALLY muscular in its origin - which again, was right scapula. I've been getting a $100 massage EVERY week which hasn't done much. I just went to a doctor who I have liked the most out of all. He told me to get an MRI (x ray was requested in May and had no irregularities) and told me to first try two weeks of PT, but I don't think it's going to change anything. The pain prevents me from enjoying anything, studying, it's drastically reduced my quality of life and I have NO IDEA what is causing it. I've tried improving posture, stretching, etc. 

The best description of the pain I can give is a general tightness in the mid-back, super tight (you can feel the contracted lats when you put your finger) and spasming upper back (shoulders, scapulas), and hurting, cracking lower back. I am currently taking ~75 MG Diclofenac Sodium twice a day. It barely even helps. I don't want to become a pill addict either. Could someone please, please, please try to help me - I would do anything to get rid of this curse. None of my friends can relate, or come close to having a pain like this. 

Info that might help you:
I'm ~6'3.5 (I was 180lbs at the start of pain, ~200 lbs now because I can't do phys activity... just watch netflix and can't be productive because I can't focus)
I tend to not have good posture but I never have... and I have tried to keep good posture but it exacerbated the pain. I have tight hamstrings, stretches had no effect on pain. 



If anyone could actually help me solve this hell-on-earth situation, I might fly to wherever you are and give you a huge hug. "
3nskfv,6,2015-10-06,"[Crit] Kinda new to writing, trying to write seriously and would love feedback",AirlessTHEGOOSE,KeepWriting,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/3nskfv/crit_kinda_new_to_writing_trying_to_write/,"The premise of this story is a more modern, 21st century look on the classic hero vs. bad guy story, but where the hero succumbs to the villain's typical ""join me"" speech near the end.

I haven't been writing for that long, but definitely looking to improve.

Here's a relevant sample from the work:
The hum of cars going by, the incessant calls of street vendors selling fake goods, and people of all kinds walking around everyone in an immediate urge to get somewhere to do what amounts to nothing. This is the face of the city, a bleak and desolate place of fallen dreams, missed opportunities, and sometimes, the small glint of success appears. Only then, do the true faces of man appear.

Today, it was a calm and windy day in the city that gave way to the drab and colorless exterior of the various mountainous sky scrapers that housed the accountants. It was in these buildings that money was exchanged, dastardly deeds done for exorbitant prices, and lives changed. Now, whether or not the lives that were altered benefited from said transactions is on a case-by-case basis, but nevertheless these lives never exited the walls of the city the same.

We take our narrative to the corners of the street, where small business owners gathered in groves to try and make a living. Selling things from shitty tourist garbage, to one of the infinite ""family style"" restaurants that serve nothing but massive pastas, all of them seem the same. However, there was one store located underneath the seemingly endless expanse of overpass that made an honest living.

A relatively new store with a new owner, this store had no name just yet but often drew the attention of many who passed by. A relatively cheerful exterior was placed on the front of a desolate row of stores, but this didn’t stop the owner from attracting almost all of the business in the area. He sold oddities, one might call it crap honestly. And at first glance, that’s exactly what it was. And even after many glances, it was still crap. However, it still drew attention. For someone who had tried so hard the city, and for a business that had absolutely no right being there, he was seemingly doing the best. When asked what his “secret” (everyone knows that in order to make it, you must have a secret, because without one nothing is possible as everything’s been tried before) was, the owner simply answered “honesty”.

The owner was the kind of man you would see on a hike across the Adirondacks; the scruffy hair, the shaggy beard, the kind of nomad one would expect to hike across the Alaskan wilderness all by himself. A drifter, if you would, but with a certain aura of wonder about him. His exterior screamed at me the word ‘youth’ but the way he conducted himself screamed maturity. He had the sense and aura of a man who knew not what he was doing, but at the same time conducted himself better than almost every one of the CEOs and high-executive lap dogs down the street. I began to wonder if the owner himself was the reason that the company saw business, but I digress. Needless to say, the man had a captivating sense around him that allowed me to remain interested in what I thought was going to be a boring tale of a worker with no purpose. I was wrong.

He would sit the patrons and I down after closing and regale us of several tales of debauchery on the corporate level. These ranged from the massive scandals of the day to the seemingly unknown escapades of high level officials. This became a weekly routine for me, because after my job ended around 6, I would stop by for a drink and then he would begin his tales. One such tale stuck out to me, and in this context felt it appropriate to give a narrative of the account.

The owner began in a way that seemed akin to a horror story, giving the dread and fear another man might give before regaling the story of his demise; but he pressed on. 

“Almost ten years ago, a corporation of some kind moved into the city, and set up shop as one of the infinite firms here. Headed by what was known as the employer, he would bring in all the poor and homeless people and do wonderful things for them – absolutely wonderful things! Training them in basic economics, and making sure they would have sufficient skills to survive in the workplace, the workplace I tell you! A modern day messiah for those who need, a St. Jimmy of the corporate world. Taking in the lost, and sometimes even the found he would make them into true workmen. Around this time, I was just graduating high school and had no plans whatsoever. For a while, I went out and wandered. I saw this… wonderful, shall you say, country. There’s a lot out there, and a lot of it isn’t worth any fucking time. A lot of shiny, obscene and unnecessarily expensive things that don’t deserve your time of day. I found that out West, a whole lot of nothing. Fuck it, this kind of stuff gets me so mad.

Anyway, like I was saying, high school just ended and I had absolutely no idea what to do next. I barely graduated, and you’re damn wrong if you thought I was going to college. Four years of education, a lifetime of debt and all for what? A piece of paper that says ‘You did it!’? No. Not for me. So I did the next thing I could think of: leave. I wasn’t content with simply staying put: I needed to leave. Because of this, I scrounged up the money I saved working at KFC and bought a van. One of those oldies, the VW’s with the crappy red paint and is essentially a bus? Yeah one of those. I threw my crap in it and headed out west.

Out there, I found nothing. Well, nothing of value. As you know, I’m the kind of person that prefers life’s simpler things. But all these people… They just don’t know man. This is the kind of person that lives each moment of their lives doing one thing and the next, always worrying about the next thing. It’s like they’re on autopilot, always doing their ‘bills’ or, what I think is the most comical, ‘work’. These people don’t know work if it hit them in the face. Honestly, single-minded people that went from one thing to the next infuriate me. Now, friend, don’t take this as an insult, I don’t mean it to apply to you. Simply because you come in here and we share coffee and stories mean you give a shit about life and enjoying it to the fullest. At least, that’s what I hope.”

I never got a chance to respond, as I very much so wanted to, but he kept on with his narrative.

“So needless to say, I spent about nine years doing all of this. Going to and fro, from place to place, trying to make sense of it all. Eventually, I made it back here. Trying to do… something. I remembered how much I hated this place, with all of its faux promises and flashing lights. The best times I’ve ever had were out, sleeping in my van doing nothing but read. Reading fills your mind with such thoughts and such wild fantasies that’s unparalleled by nearly anything on this world.

I needed money. Obviously, to make this work I needed a job, so I went to the homeless shelter to find some work. I mean, I was homeless. I sold the van for food money, so I would be able to fucking eat something; even if it was just a double cheeseburger a day. I set up shop there for a while, trying my best to find work. I did a whole lot of stuff, from working with the city plumbers as an assistant to working the register; again. It felt like I was going in circles man, and I hated every bit of it. So finally, there’s news spreading around the shelter advertising some new shmuck who was offering jobs to the homeless. Word was, he was ridiculously rich and had a lot of influence so he could afford the job training for a bunch of low-lives like us. Because of this, I ran over and signed up. With what little credentials I had, I handed in the application.

Fast forward a few days, and when I logged on to my email on the public PC to check for a response. And to my immediate pleasure, there was an email from the HMFIC himself, saying he wanted to meet with me in person as he found my application “most appealing” and “intrigued at my potential”. I chalked this off to corporate bullshit, and headed over there as soon as I was done with my current… project. I borrowed a suit from one of my friends in the shelter, and luckily he and I were the same build so we fit in the same kind of suit. It was an interesting suit, it felt brand new for being so well worn. Maybe it was because it was the first time this decrepit old thing wore such formal attire, or maybe it was because the suit itself had something to do with it. Damned if I know, but needless to say it was a pretty intriguing feeling.

The walk there was something straight out of hell, I swear. The streets were lined with people all doing the same thing: looking at those damn phones. I swear, I’ll never understand the need to be constantly wired to your workmates, lovers, friends, whatever 24/7. Having to weave my way in and out of these drones was something I always hated doing. The slap of the dress shoes, the click of the heels, and the tops of their damn heads was something straight out of The Wall! Monotony, monotony monotony! The ballad of the street rang true, the percussion playing at full forte! The cars the bass, the vendors the harmony and the thoughts of my mind: the melody. 

I arrived at my destination around fifteen minutes early, and took the sights in. The building was… weird to say the least. The devoidness of the building was unprecedented. Everything wasn’t as it seemed. The building was decorated with all sorts of flowers and paintings, the largest of which a mural of a helping hand extending to those in need, who all clamor to his palm. It was painted right over the secretary’s desk. Seemed out of place, then I remembered why I was there. However, there was something that was weird about the mural that really stuck out to me. It hadn’t been washed before, I could tell. It was dirty, especially the palm. For some reason, this stuck with me as I walked through the looming doors to see what wonders awaited me inside.

I sat down in the waiting area, hoping to be called up sooner rather than later. Being in that building made me feel… awkward and small. I felt a part of the machine that was the modern day, but looking into the future I could only realize the futility of resistance. Change is a part of all of our lives, and I couldn’t do a damn thing to prevent it. 

The attendant finally called me up, and she asked me all the basic information. Who I was, where I needed to go, why I’m here, all the good stuff. She had an aura of subordinance around her, as the majority of people working behind desks did. She felt like she was the puppet on strings, doing the bidding of the higher-ups for a greater purpose. A robot, programmed to do something over and over and over again with no such thing as respite. Felt weird, giving answers to a machine. I received my elevator pass and moved on with my day, heading over towards those elevators to head up to the 13th floor. I passed my card to the attendant, and a flurry of button presses later and a brief feeling of upheaval slash queasiness later, I had arrived.”

It was at this point did I notice how truly late it was out, and thought I should get home to my family. Then I remembered my wife had left me four years ago for my boss’ intern, and took the kids with her. I was left with the apartment and the dog. How wonderful. How or why that happened, I’ll never know but for some reason I had forgotten such a momentous tragedy in the midst of this man’s enchanting narrative. It began to rain out, a soft pitter-patter on the overpass overhead provided a steady tempo for the ballad this man was providing. “Everything alright, there? Looking a bit pale.” He commented.

“Yeah, whatever. Just continue.”

No medications other than Aleve though I don't think it does much

Back in Highschool I was diagnosed with Systemic Onset Juvenal Rheumatoid Arthritis.  It was bad at the time I would get bad rashes along my arms and legs as well as random joint pains in my ankles, wrists, knees, ect.  The symptoms subsided since then and I've been ok since.  Also wrestled all though highschool which I know probably did a number to my joints.

Though i've never been fully ok from it i'm guessing.  I can't remember anymore how long it's been because it just feels like always has been this way at this point, but I feel like shit.  I feel like my shoulders and wrists can't support the weight they used to, my shoulders can't make full circles, and they crack and lock up constantly.  My knees constantly crack, click, lock up, and get really sore after not even 10 minutes of running.  Ankles are better than they used to but still can get some pain and crack.  I'm a tough kid and had tough love during my earlier arthritis problem so I always just ignored and worked though the pain and I have been for years, but i'm starting to get worried about what might get worse or not get fixed.  I try to stay pretty active still, go to the gym when I can but it's hard to motivate myself when i'm... uncomfortable from joints and soreness.  I feel like I have no cartilage left in my shoulders and knees, though I know that's probably not the problem.

The main thing is i'm not sure where to start to find out whats wrong or if there isn't anything wrong and I just have shitty shoulders/knees.  I feel to proud I think to bring it up with anyone or something, so I'm hoping there's some kind of joint or bone doctor here that can guide me and help me out, I don't have much money (putting myself though a Registered Dietitian internship, 5 weeks in!) so I want to avoid going to unnecessary doctors visits (plus I really don't have a primary physician right now, can't find one i like)

Anyway I know this was long and thank you so much whoever took the time to read this, hopefully just typing this out and getting it off my chest that I might need to do something will help me somehow."
3nswt9,26,2015-10-07,My experience at the JYP audition,kpopbust,kpop,https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/3nswt9/my_experience_at_the_jyp_audition/,"So i am fairly new to Kpop as of this year and saw that JYP was holding auditions near me in LA. So i decided to try out. I am 24 so pretty old in terms of what they usually expect from their auditioners from what i heard. But i decided to audition anyways to give it a try. I have been to several different types of auditions such as American Idol and the X factor and the experience I had here was no different. The only difference was the volume of people. this audition was much smaller. also the people holding the auditions didn't seem to care. I couldn't tell if it was because they weren't actual employees of the company or if it was because they were bored. (i'll touch on this later on)
Anyways, I noticed that on the site, they suggested people come by their number but I just went at a time which was convenient for me so i guess it didn't really matter too much. Anyways I guess Ill talk about my experience and my opinions. 
First I got there and there was hardly anyone there. I noticed there were some people outside the building area who had auditioned already and were leaving. The audition was held in this room of a build corporate type building. It was the studio for a show I think. anyways we get there and they have you sign in or fill out applications. Once you hand in your application they give you a number and tell you to sit in the waiting area. There were several people who were staff and wore stickers that said staff. Then there were some older people who kept walking in and out. I wasn't sure who they were but there was an older man who i think might have been an employee of JYP or something but didn't end up judging us. When i got there they said they were waiting for the judges to come back from lunch since i got there around lunch time. But there were two young ladies who were walking around snapping pictures and they ended up being the ones who were in charge of holding the auditions. I don't know if they were just interns, employees, or just place holders while the judges returned. Im not sure. I know sometimes in american idol auditions to get through people faster, they just have a random employed staff member hold the spot and conduct auditions while real judges take breaks. This is to give the judges a break but also cut the volume of people faster since they just call you in and then have you leave without giving any results.
In the waiting room it was pretty diverse. I could tell some were just fans of kpop which in a way bothered me. I feel like they weren't serious about this opportunity and only saw it as a way to be close to their idols. anyways, when they were ready, they called us up in groups and then explained to us the proceedure, stand on the line, sing/ dance when ready, have music ready etc. We walk in and theres a big camera facing people as they wait as well as the table for the judge (the two girls who were snapping pictures which ended up being posted to JYP's social media, which is what gave me the impression they were interns). they have you stand on a line and audition 5 at a time. They have you start once the person before you finishes. many people sang in korean who i could tell didn't speak korean and simply memorized the sounds while some actually knew korean and sung in korean, and then some danced. Some danced their own choreo (which was cool to see) while others danced the choreo of a group. after the process is over they just usher you out and let the next group in. 

What i thought of the auditions
It was nerve racking, in other audition experiences, you find out on the spot if you got through to the next round or not, i wasn't exactly sure how these auditions worked. Also because the judges don't say or communicate much gave me a feeling of uncertainty. 
Group auditions made it more nerve racking because it feels like more pressure.
didn't know if judges who judged our group were the real judges which bothered me (the judges who were in charge of our audition group were the ones outside in the waiting area who were snapping pictures and posting it to social media)  
auditioners seemed more like kpop fans than aspiring artists. Though i could be wrong, but some of the people there just seemed to be there because they enjoyed certain groups or artists. For example, they all freaked out when certain idols came up on the tv while they were playing their mv or concerts. 

Tips:
practice, try practicing in front of family and friends or in public. to get rid of nerves. 
be genuine, i cant emphasize enough how much it bothered me that there were these people who were there mainly only because they were kpop fans. Hypothetically speaking its like they only wanted to try and get closer to their idols rather than be singers or artists. Sure you enjoy singing kpop songs, but do you even have a desire to be a musician?
Get there as soon as you can or when its convenient for you. from past auditions from x factor and american idol, I learned that the time they give you is only ""suggested"" meaning the sooner the better. They'll always have people waiting and if you get there earlier it wont hurt and it'll most likely save you time.

3nt30y,1,2015-10-07,Why does everything have to be so difficult?,wldd5,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3nt30y/why_does_everything_have_to_be_so_difficult/,"One of the most understated troubles with depression is how it makes simple tasks so difficult.  Sometimes I feel like I move in slow motion compared to everyone else.  I space out a lot, I have trouble remembering, my hand-eye coordination can be off.

It's all so difficult, and I try to find help in so much.  Exercise makes me feel weak and self-conscious.  I love to read, but depression makes it hard to read for me.  I try indulging in different hobbies, but they can be so expensive.  There is no outdoor hobby I can really start, living in the suburbs of a city in a very boring area of the country.  

I can't even listen to a full album or watch a full movie anymore due to my attention span.  Seriously, I can't make it through Empire Strikes Back anymore thanks to depression.  I hate my job, working at Starbucks.  I feel like the manager is condescending.  I keep getting put in the worst spots.  It's part of being new, but I feel like it's just not for me.  I need money though.

On top of it, graduating is going to be very difficult.  I didn't fill out my forms for my internship on time and didn't get credit.  It was hard enough getting one, and I don't think I will get a second.  I don't even care about graduating anymore.  I just feel so lost.

I have almost no interests anymore.  Reading and watching basketball when I can.  That's it.  Everything feels like a blur.  I have no energy to do anything.

Sometimes I think there are just people with no place in the world, and I'm one of them.  I can't find the positives in anything.  I can't make the best out of a situation.  I feel like I have been left behind evolutionally and am being carried by today's society.  There is no place for me, but there has to be a place for everyone.  I can't live in today's world.  I can't live in any world.  I just don't feel like I am living.  I'm just drifting through time."
3nti8r,7,2015-10-07,I [18F] dont know how to tell my boyfriend [24M] of 8 months that I dont trust him,heyimachair,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3nti8r/i_18f_dont_know_how_to_tell_my_boyfriend_24m_of_8/,"We met while we were both in college last February: I'm in my third year and he just started working this month. We started dating officially on March.

I'm gonna cut to the chase: he was in a long distance relationship on the first few months of our relationship (I didn't know) and when I found out, he broke it off with the girl because he ""chose"" me. This was on May, about 4 months ago.

Doesnt end there though. I went snooping on his phone then too and saw that he's been sexting some other girls as well, and he possibly might have had sex with 2-3 girls on March. I tried confronting him about it, but he denied everything. I had proof of it on his phone but I just decided to drop everything because I can't own up to snooooping and he kept reassuring me that he loved me and he'd never do anything to hurt me.

After coming back from summer break, I went snooping again. Terrible, I know. But he was messaging another girl (he wanted to have sex with before, as seen on his older messages) and when she asked about his relationship status with me on facebook, he said we werent dating exclusively. I confronted him about this again and he said he just liked the attention and he was never gonna do anything more than that.

I also saw his messages to other girls, obviously flirting, even asking one of his exes from highschool to ""get back at him"" so they can have coffee sometime. 

So what made me decide on making this post? I saw nudes of 2 of his exes on his desktop, hidden in a tiny folder called ""lost saga screenshots"". I was just trying to see the lost saga screenshots...

The thing is, I never seem to catch him on the act. I'm always a month or two late. And even if I did, I dont think I would know what to do. I don't scream when I'm mad, I get quiet and I start hurting.  

We're just.. great together. We have so much fun and the sex is nice. We play games together, we watch telly and stupid shit on the internet together, we're even planning on doing so many things together: he reminds me that he still wants to come with me when I do my internship somewhere in Spain, we want to get a sandwich grill, a cat, a gaming room with butt lamps... It's all just so lovely with him, but there's still a voice in my head that doubts him a lot. He always tells me he loves me and how he wants to build a life with me and I feel it.. I think.. It's hard to tell when he's lying.  

Wow.. that's quite a fucking lot of fucking (or emotional fucking whatever). I don't know what to do. On one hand, I still want to give him another chance but I dont know how much more I can handle before I fucking explode. What should I do? Should I confront him about the problem and try to fix things? But how? Or should I just wait for another one of his escapades, dump all of these heartaches on him then and leave?

TL;DR: First there was lots of fun and love and sex. Then there was lots of snooping, lots of cheating, lots of confrontation, and lots of his exes' nudes (5 actually). And then Ally had no clue what to do."

GroenLinks, de Partij van de Arbeid, de Communistische Partij Nederland, de Piratenpartij en de Socialistische Partij zijn akkoord gegaan om samen een coalitie te vormen en het land te gaan regeren.

""Noodzakelijk,"" aldus /u/KrabbHD, de partijleider van de Partij van de Arbeid, ""hopelijk kan deze coalitie standhouden."" De Partij van de Arbeid was uit de vorige coalitie gestapt nadat de andere partijen intern het vertrouwen in de coalitie zouden hebben opgezegd. 

De coalitie Breed Links is van plan om Nederland door de rest van de regeerperiode heen te sluizen, en is de enige coalitie die een begroting heeft uitgewerkt. /u/Th8, de partijleider van GroenLinks, reageert: ""Het land staat voorop. Een onvolledige begroting zorgt voor een grote crisis. Om tot aan de verkiezingen demissionair zonder begroting te zitten is rampzalig voor het volk, en dat kan niet. Breed Links is de enige weg vooruit.""

##""Het land staat voorop.""    
^^\- ^^/u/Th8

Vorige week viel de coalitie tussen D66, GroenLinks en de Partij van de Arbeid uit elkaar na het indienen van een motie van wantrouwen ingediend door partijleider /u/Jekkert van de VVD.

Volgens artikel 28:5 van de grondwet is een interim-regering wat er zou moeten gebeuren na de val van het kabinet. De raad is vooralsnog onbeslist over het bestaansrecht van de interim-regering.

""Het is belangrijk dat we ons niet laten overvallen door te lang achter te blijjven,"" aldus /u/TheByzantineDragon, een voormalige minister van GroenLinks, die de onbeslistheid van de raad veroordeelt. ""Het beste voor Nederland zou zijn dat de raad snel beslist om de interim-regering toe te staan.""

Niet iedereen is het daar mee eens. ""Met BreedLinks vervang je een wanstaltig kabinet met nog een wanstaltiger kabinet,"" aldus de nieuwe partijleider van de PVV, /u/kooienb, ""die waarschijnlijk binnen een week of twee uit elkaar valt, omdat de partijleiders er niet uit komen welke vorm van hoekig communisme ze het Nederlandse volk moeten voorschotelen.""

Wat er gaat gebeuren in de politiek is dus nog onduidelijk. Verder nieuws zal gepubliceerd worden op de website.

I am speking with all the women freely and am actually making an effort to get to know them. Asked three girls out yesterday and all three of them were willing to go for a coffee. This has never happened to me. I have started putting effort in how I dress up and have even had two guys who wanted to talk to me. Both of them were motivated investment banking interns as opposed to the beta bros trying to pull me down. I have cut contact with people that make me feel bad everyday. I have had two girls saying sorry to me for their behaviour to me in the past. There is only one girl though whom I really like who has been emotionally manipulating me for the past year. She keeps me around for her self esteem. We had dinner together yesterday as she asked me to accompany her. All the while she said that she was going to study with me but when we came back to the library, she said she was sitting somewhere else. She has been doing this for months now. Tells me that we will study together but never arrives or goes out with other people while we are studying while I sit there waiting for her. She always apologizes profusely every night after repeating the same behavior though. After last night, I just want to put an end to her game. I need to send her a fitting reply after which she never bothers to do these things again. What do I tell her?
Note- I have had a history of bullying throughout my life but when I left my country everyone started respecting me for who I was. These incidents of the past just keep me from respecting myself but I have improved a lot. I feel obliged to take the girl's shit as I feel that she is still treating me better than the people In my past. When I went back to my home country for my vacations all these people started inviting me for dinners and parties and were in awe of me but I still don't know how to forgive them."
3nuiek,318,2015-10-07,"Me [35 M] with my wife [37 F] married 7yr together 9yr, divorcing after uncovering insane amount of lies and infedelity",bubba_abobo,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3nuiek/me_35_m_with_my_wife_37_f_married_7yr_together/,"I've decided to finally divorce my wife...it's hard to say those words. But I know this is my only option at this point. I'll try to layout the situation here and then wait patiently for your advice on how best to proceed. This is not a decision I've come to lightly, it's been building for many years.

Basically, my wife has lied to me about everything from the moment I met her. When I say everything, I do mean everything. About who she is, events that have happened in her life, her infidelities, and her commitment to change. I've confronted her about some of these things before and even then, when I've had her at her most vulnerable and she confessed some of her lies to me and told me the ""truth"", I've since found out that they were just more lies. I'm not a psychologist by any means, but I am pretty certain she has Histrionic Personality Disorder mixed with a good helping of pathological lying. She seems to match every symptom listed on Wikipedia. The tale I'm about to tell here contains some sexual language, so if you're not comfortable with that just be forewarned.

When I first met her, I was getting out of a long term relationship so I admittedly was just looking for a quick hookup. This was before Tinder and I didn't know about Craigslist personals section, so I turned to AdultFriendFinder. I was a cheapskate and didn't want to pay for the service, so I searched around a bit using her AFF handle and eventually found her IM name. I sent her a message and we began chatting. A few weeks later we decided to meet for lunch. Lunch was a success and followed that up with dinner, and a few more dates, etc. etc. She'd call me over in the morning for sex before work and we were hitting it off pretty well. She told me she lived with a male roommate so she'd wait to call me until he left so we could be alone. I never met the guy, but I didn't care. I had no reason to and in my naivete just let it slide. She did mention she was previously married and when that marriage ended (because he cheated on her repeatedly) she needed a place to stay and couldn't afford to live on her own, so hence the roommate.

One night not long into our relationship I was out getting dinner with some co-workers while we were working on an overnight project, I got a call from her in hysterics. She called me seemingly inconsolable. She said she found out that the man who raised her (we'll call him Italian dad) was not her real father. He was a man her mother had been dating while her real father was in prison. When her father got out of prison he was introduced to her (as a child) as her uncle. Real dad stayed out of the picture while Italian dad played the role of father figure. Italian dad got angry at mom and the whole situation and couldn't handle it anymore and let it slip that he was not her real father, etc. etc. and that Uncle Dad was her real dad. I had not met any of her family at this point, even though she'd met all of mine and most of my extended family as well. Sidenote: I call him Italian dad because she said she spent summers in Italy with Italian Dad's parents (who lived in Italy) when she was old enough to travel as an unaccompanied minor through her high school years. I'll revisit this one later.

I was impressed with this woman. She had a bachelor's degree from the same university I went to (though from a different campus) and then went on to get her master's from Columbia in NYC. She worked in her field for a few years before getting burned out and just fell back to working in retail because it was so much less stressful. She loved me and I loved her. She decided she would go on the pill because sex without a condom is so much better for both of us. And then....she's pregnant.

I am nothing if not loyal and honorable. What I didn't tell her was that I had already mentally decided I would ask her to marry me, but I wanted it to be romantic and so was going to wait for the perfect time to ask. But as her pregnancy hormones raged a few months into the pregnancy she was sobbing uncontrollably and convinced I was going to leave her. After learning of the drama with her dad I could certainly understand her feelings of being alone or abandoned. Add to that her Catholic guilt of being an unmarried single mother and she broke down. And so to rescue her, I decided I couldn't wait any longer. I had to calm her, and so I asked her to marry me that night she had this breakdown. I didn't have a ring, we were in our living room, she was sobbing out of her mind, and I felt bad for her. No romance there. Oh well....

Our son was born and we were getting our new life established. It was a hectic time as any new parent can attest, but we still made time for each other whenever we could manage. Throughout the early days of our relationship she was active in an online chat system that was predominantly sex oriented. She explained that she'd been part of that community for so long and had made some really good friends through there. I could understand that sense of belonging, as I had my own online ""community"" I was a part of, although not sex chat related. I had no reason to distrust her and told her that was fine. I even helped her make some sexy avatars to go along with the site's theme. She was really into sex and that really turned me on, so I wasn't complaining.

But then...things started to cross boundaries. I wanted to keep my wife happy, so I stayed quiet and just pretended I didn't notice certain things. One of the first of these incidences happened a few months after our son was born. I came home from work and found her masturbating in our bedroom. My first thought was, ""Wow, this is hot. Time to get it on."" As I stepped into the room I could see her slyly put away her phone and as she's doing so I hear a male voice on the other end. She was having phone sex with some guy. Ok, play it cool, she's amped up and ready, just ignore it, so I did. But I couldn't forget it. Over the next several years (including the present) there would be several more instances of strange phone calls I overheard when she thought no one was listening. She would tell these guys fantastical made up stories, inventing elaborate alternate lives for herself and her family. One conversation in particular I heard her having through a closed door was telling how she was a widow and that she was spending some time with her family at their ski cottage in the mountains to just get away from everything for awhile after the stress of burying her husband. And this was normal for her! Every time (and there have been many times!) she has an entire alternate persona that she keeps up with these men. Sometimes using real names, sometimes made up. Sometimes using partially true information for her story, but typically completely made up. I have no idea how she can keep these dozens of plot lines straight from one day to the next and often with multiple people at once; it's mind boggling!

I realize I'm getting a bit long-winded here, but I wanted to establish how fucked up she is. I'll skip ahead to some of the more recent and more egregious violations of our marriage. So three years ago I was away for the weekend, but not terribly far away, visiting friends. Typically when I do this (a couple times a year) I just stay overnight there because they are generally very late nights and I'm too tired to drive. But this night I had a nagging feeling that she was up to no good; by the way she was acting and texting me, offering up details for things I hadn't asked about, being overly verbose about everything going on with her night. She's not like that with me normally, so something was off. It was 1:30 or 2:00AM and I decided I needed to go home that night. It was only about an hour's drive, but I'd get some coffee and be fine. One of the details she offered up was that one of her friends (who I'll call Jane) had come over that night and she had brought some pot with her that they were going to smoke (I've never done any drugs ever and am vehemently opposed to taking anything illegal and she knows this). She texted again later and let me know that Jane would be staying the night because she was in no condition to drive. So I get home around 3:00AM and there's no other car in the driveway. I look around and there are no cars parked on the street near our house either. Where's Jane's car? So I go inside quietly just in case I didn't see the car or my wife picked up Jane earlier in the evening, expecting to find Jane asleep on the couch. What I found on the couch instead is what appeared to be a dried semen stain and a very loud snoring sound coming from upstairs in the bedroom. I quietly made my way upstairs to our bedroom and confirmed my hunch that drove me to come home that evening. Lying there in my bed next to my wife was a strange man that I'd never seen before. I was in complete shock and felt like my world was ending. I went across the hall to my daughter's bedroom (we have a daughter at this point as well, but both kids were spending the weekend at my in-law's, another red flag since I was away that weekend, why also unload the kids on them when they don't exactly live nearby?) and just sit there with my head in my hands for what must have been at least 30 minutes or more contemplating what to do next. For as calm as my initial response was, I decided I couldn't be calm any longer. I went in the bedroom, flipped the light on, and punched the guy in the head as hard as I could. In fact I punched so hard my wedding ring flew off of my other hand (a sign perhaps?). I grabbed him by the legs and pulled him out of my bed telling him to get the fuck out of my house. I'll skip some of the details here, but looking back on it, I don't think he knew she was married. He seemed generally surprised that I was there. To top it off, he didn't drive there (hence the lack of another car) and so I had to reluctantly allow my wife to drive him home. I wasn't thinking clearly at that point or I'd have made him walk home or get a cab. When she returned home we sat in the kitchen and talked until the sun came up. She swore up and down that nothing happened and they just got high and fell asleep. The thing was I didn't catch them in the act, I couldn't prove anything. Magically the stain on the couch disappeared after I finally fell asleep later that day, a picture of us on our honeymoon that I pointed out was missing from our refrigerator re-appeared.

I had many doubts about her, even before this, of details of her life that I just never brought up because I felt they weren't important or worth starting a fight over. But at this point, I had to ask her flat out just to see if she'd tell me the truth. One insignificant thing was the high school she attended. She's always claimed to have gone to a certain Catholic school in her town but I couldn't find any evidence of this, and actually believed she went to the public school district she would have lived in (one of the worst districts in the state). I didn't care what school she went to, I just wanted to know the truth. She maintained that she went to the Catholic school. Ok, whatever, that isn't really important. What I really wanted to get some truth to was her roommate when we met. Over the years I picked up little tidbits about the roommate that never added up. Things that coincided too much with details of her ex-husband. I said, ""I don't think [roommate] is a real person. I think [roommate] is actually [ex-husband] and you were married when I met you. I think I was the other man that ended your marriage!"" Denial. She had a story for this too...some of the details changed slightly, others elaborated on, but she had the bases covered and I had no proof other than a hunch. Eventually, I forgave her and told myself I needed to trust her again for our relationship to survive and for the sake of our kids, so with our foundation shaken but not broken, we moved on.

About six-eight months later is when I heard her conversation/phone call with the guy claiming to spend time with her family in the imaginary ski cottage, etc. (she's never skied in her life, her family is poor, there is no ski cottage). When she hung up that call I was standing outside our closed bedroom door where she was taking it and told her to go back inside. I warned her that I heard everything she was saying and I wanted it to stop. She at first denied that the call ever took place. I mentioned specific details of the call and then she knew she'd been caught. Always a lie with her, that's her first and only self-defense mechanism. Another six-eight months go by (this day happens to be my birthday) and I'm working from home. She's also off that day for some reason so we're both at home and she's been feverishly texting all day with yet another guy. How do I discover this one? She handed me her phone. Yep, she's also not very good at hiding her tracks. We've had separate cell phone accounts for awhile and we finally decided to combine them onto one service. My carrier was the better deal, so she would port her number to my account. While we're both home we decide it's a good time to do the port since her phone would be out of commission while we wait for the port to complete over to her new phone. She hands me her old phone, I do a backup of it so she can maintain contacts, pictures, etc. While I have the phone in my hands I receive a few txts from a number I don't recognize and it's not saved in her contacts either. The port is taking a few hours (as it always does when switching carriers) and she's growing increasingly impatient (obvi she didn't want to stop chatting with this new guy). Port eventually completes and all of the queued text messages come pouring in. She takes her phone and starts responding....hundreds and hundreds of them in a single day. On my plan (that she's now a part of) there is no unlimited texting, you pay for each message. I check our account usage the next day and I see the hundreds of messages and ask her about them. I tell her to knock it off, it's costing us a hell of a lot more money than it should. Eventually find out it's yet another guy, I can't remember the resolution because frankly, it's happened so many times they all blur together at this point. Confront her about it yet again, she promises to stop...again.

Three more months go by and now I'm in full paranoia mode. I check her phone whenever I'm able to, reading e-mails, texts, looking at pictures she's taken...find a few nudes that she sure as hell never sent to me. Long story short (haha, yeah right) she ends up meeting a guy for lunch and then they later go to a nearby park. A message sent after their lunch date has her wishing there weren't so many people around in the park so they could have done more. That's it! I've had it! She calls me for something later and I can't hide the fact that I'm pissed with her. I leave my office so I can talk in private and I let her have it. I know what she's been up to, I know about the lunch date, the park, everything. Flirting with someone through texts/e-mails/phone calls is one thing, but it's entirely different when you're going on dates with these guys. She breaks down crying, fearful that our marriage is over. I relent...yet again (I said I was loyal), but warn her that there will be no more chances. This is it.

That last chance took approximately eight months (at least until I caught her, maybe sooner) but that nearly brings us to present time. Did you know you could message people through Yelp? She did apparently, and was chatting up some local guy through that. That's where I found her first most recent round of shenanigans. From there she moved onto using Kik Messenger. She posted on Reddit looking for Kik Pals, and it didn't take long for her to snare a few. I haven't been able to closely follow her activities on Kik but I know she's been in regular communication with at least two and their messages are not exactly ""just friends"". Again, the other day she needed me to do some things with her phone because of problems she's been having and I quickly found a folder containing all pictures and videos she's sent through Kik...extremely explicit material. But this discovery was *after* I decided to divorce her.

You see...ever since that night I came home early and found her in bed with another man, I've never been able to truly forgive her. It's always been there eating away at me. No matter what I tell myself, that I can trust her, that I need to trust her, that she really does love me...I know she would always fall back to lying and mistrust. The last several weeks for no specific reason (other than the culmination of the years of lies), I finally decided I couldn't take it any longer. I debated back and forth on whether this was the right thing to do and then, I pressed Send...I wrote a ""letter"" that I sent to her ex-husband via Facebook messenger. I had no idea if he'd even see it, let alone respond. But I had questions that I needed answers to before I made my divorce decision and he had nothing to gain or lose by being honest with me. Within 30 seconds, I got the ""Seen"" notice. Another minute or two go by and he responds, ""Well I am sure she has lied to you about me and my past too. Let me just say that right from the top."" Holy shit, this is happening. We proceeded to chat for the next hour and a half about everything. He even wants to meet me in person so we can talk more. We have a quid pro quo conversation about everything I've ever wondered about her and things he's wondered about me.

To summarize:

1. I was the other man! They were still married and living together when I met her.
2. The roommate is a complete fabrication. I did a public records search on Spokeo and did find someone with the same name as [Roommate] who lived on the same street as one of my wife's old addresses, but [ex-husband] didn't know who he was so, weird coincidence or neighbor that he didn't know? 
3. She knew who her father was all along. Italian dad was completely made up. Those summer trips to Italy? Never happened. She visited there once on a school trip, that's it. 
4. Speaking of school, yes, she went to the public shool I had suspected for quite some time. She's not even a Catholic! Where'd she go during that period she claimed to be going to Sunday mass? Probably on more dates with random dudes! Oh and the two degrees she claimed to have? After catching her with lunch date dude, I demanded to know truths to the lies she's been telling me. One that she offered up willingly was that she had no degrees. She said she attended both schools, but never finihsed either one. [Ex-husband] informed me that she never even attended either of those schools, just one semester at a local college and that's it. So even when ""confessing"" some truth to me, she just told me different lies!
5. She's pulled this same shit with [ex-husband] repeatedly!
6. Ran up his credit cards and left them unpaid (relatedly, basically drained my 401(k) through loans and early withdrawals she talked me into doing)
7. Do I need to keep going on!? Everything is a lie! All of it I've said here and I've only begun to scratch the surface! There's more, but I don't have time in my life to go over the dozens and dozens of transgressions. Well, maybe one more. One story she's told countless times is that she lived in New York City during 9/11 (you know, while *not* attending Columbia). She told of how the attack happened while she was in class and the fear and panic everyone in class experienced as it happened. About how she knew a few people working at the WTC as interns for various companies and that some of them never made it out alive. To go along with this, she's told me a few times that she worked as an intern at the New York Times and the day after the attack she got a shared byline on one of the front page stories that ran on the 12th, even going so far as to once say that story was nominated for a Pulitzer prize. All of it lies...[ex-husband] informed me that they never lived in NYC. They visited a few times for some fun weekends, but never lived there. That is insulting to every New Yorker who DID experience the tragedies of 9/11 and it makes me sick.

So, I'm going to divorce my wife. There will be no trial seperation, I've already given her enough opportunity to change to no effect. There will be no counseling, I've had all I can take. I can never trust her again. I wish it didn't have to be this way for the kids' sake, but it has to be this way. I know that in the long run this is the right thing to do, but I'm frankly scared to death of the storm that's brewing and what hell we will all have to go through in the interim. I love my kids more than anything in this world and I want nothing but the best for both of them.

So now I've concluded my tale of woe and I come to my next chapter. Where do I go from here? How can I make this process proceed as best as possible? I don't have a lot of money, we've always lived week to week. If we can do this without involving lawyers that would be best I think...neither one of us could afford one anyway. Will she try to screw me over with the kids? I don't know. This is the uncertainty I'm facing and I don't like it. As weird as it may sound, I don't want anything bad to happen to her either. I have every right to wish her ill will, but I don't want to fight with her after this is all done. I need us to have a mature parenting only relationship after I tell her I want to divorce her and I need her to work with me to make as smooth a transition as possible.

Some hitches in this: Neither one of us has any family very close by. They're not too far away, but far enough that neither one of us could conceivably stay with them if needed. She is a work-at-home employee for her company and she's going to need to address that situation; I don't want her to be fired because she has no place to work from. Because she is a work-from-home employee, she's currently able to get our kids to and from school as needed. Any change in our living arrangement needs to take that into account.

I have been advised from a close friend who went through a divorce last year to wait until after the holidays just for emotional support reasons. Holidays alone really suck.... Plus this will give me some time to get things planned for (I hope).

So I ask everyone for your advice on what to do from here, any resources that could help guide me through this, and anything I can do to help my kids cope. I was 19 when my parents split so I could handle things as an adult. My brother was only 13 though and he really declined after. My kids are 5 and 8...I'm scared of how this is going to affect them more than anything.

Help me....please.

P.S. Before anyone asks, yes, she had an Ashely Madison account but I didn't need their big data breach to tell me that. I found that out during the debacle on my birthday. Just one of the e-mails I saw while I had the phone.

   
**tl;dr**: I've been lied to from the very beginning of my relationship about literally everything and been cheated on repeatedly over the course of 9 years. I've decided to divorce my wife but have no idea how to proceed with little to no money to spare for a lawyer. What should I do?"
3nurd3,4,2015-10-07,"I 19 M, want to ask out a 21 F, but I don't know how.",ConfusedLover23,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3nurd3/i_19_m_want_to_ask_out_a_21_f_but_i_dont_know_how/,"I'll try and summarize this quick.

I met this girl at work back in May 2015, I go to school so this was my first summer job, the girl I worked with was doing an summer internship at the company and was basically my boss.

At first I was really shy with her, I am in general shy with girls. She was outgoing and so I decided to quit being shy and actually talk to her. We hit it off and had a lot of common interests at first I was glad I met her and could consider her as a friend. 

But then as time went by, around Mid July, I started developing feelings for her, I always wanted to be with her at work and just talk. She planned on leaving by end of August which made me more sad as time went by. Luckily my head manager convinced her to stay and so she did but unfortunately I could only see her one day of the week because we both had school and we worked part time.

In September, I got to talk to her a lot on the day we both worked together and my feelings for her grew, we added each other on social media platforms and I made small talk with her on Whatsapp. 

Last Friday, things went bad as I got the news she was being transferred to another branch, I was crushed because it would mean I would barely see her again, only on the rare occasion. She was also sad because it meant she wouldn't be seeing me or my other co-workers as well.

Luckily, I messaged her on Whatsapp and told her I will miss her and said I will continue to message her for advice, to which she said yes please do, I must keep her in the loop at work so since then, we've been messaging on and off occasionally. 

This Monday, we messaged back and forth for 12 hours and continued onto Tuesday. 

The way she talks to me through texts makes me feel like she likes me, I always make her laugh in our texts and our common interests really add to why I like her even more. 

Every time we look into each others eyes I feel a connection with her. But I still feel like I am getting mixed signals about it. 

I am totally in love with her and I can't go a day without her not being on my mind. 

This Friday is a long weekend (Canadian Thanksgiving) She's working that day and so am I, but just at different branches. I really want to ask her out after work and do something, but clearly I don't want to sound like it's a date, just a get together in which we just talk and have fun. 

She ends her internship by November and I want to make sure I strike before she leaves. 


   
**tl;dr**: I like this girl, we work together, she's at a different branch now, she finishes her internship by November, I really like her and want to go out with her. How 2 do?

How do I ask her out without it sounding like it's a date?

If she says yes, what's the best place for us to go to? 

How long before I can pop the question of asking her if she likes me? "

Resources, advice and potential hirers welcome!",YipWreck,london_forhire,https://www.reddit.com/r/london_forhire/comments/3nuv25/for_hire_graduate_psychopharmacology_cognitive/,"Throughout my employment and educational history I have felt that academic research, particularly in the fields of psychology and neuroscience, was the area I most thrived in. The projects I sought out and gained from early on in my degree, both through voluntary and internship research projects, led me to have excellent and varied experience managing research projects and data collection, management and processing. The opportunity to progress my experience and contribute to future projects is ideal. I would describe my personal characteristics as motivated, versatile, organised and extremely technologically proficient, as evidenced in my Minor in Computing from my BsC Hons Psychology with Computing degree and my previous experience.

I have over 1 year of research associate experience in the field of psychopharmacology and 3 years in the field of cognitive neuroscience. The psychopharmacology research involved constructing online surveys using diagnostic quantitative scales concerning novel psychoactive substance use, mood and anxiety in 2 separate phases. I collected, processed and analysed the data of 100+ participants utilising SPSS and Excel. The cognitive neuroscience research involved educating fellow researchers on the administering of the Jansari Executive Function (JEF) cognitive test, digitally constructing faces for face recognition tests and administering such tests in-person to the general public, and constructing yet-to-be-administered new face memory studies. This shows my versatility in the research field in data management and administering, construction and processing of testing methods, both online and in-person.

I thrive in working under pressure and I’m also experienced in sales, hospitality, communication and people skills, as displayed by my other previous employment. I have also undertaken administrative work which further shows my organizational capabilities.

My versatility is brought forth in my willingness to learn in new, interesting and testing situations. In my personal time I am heavily invested in fitness, nutrition and literature."

[This section contains awkward teen-aged drama.]

---

“I had a really good time.” Chris held her hands behind her back, pushing out her chest and looked down at the sidewalk outside her home. He had walked her to the door. “You really know how to treat a lady.” 

Jashua smiled, “I'm glad.” And there was an awkward silence following it, as if there was not another good thing he could say. 

“So, did you like it?” She asked.

“I had a lot of fun too...” There was something he wanted to say, and she had a feeling she knew what it was. 

“But you don't want to go out on another one.” She tried to finish his sentence. 

“I mean...” he took a deep breath, trying to find the right words, if there were any. “You are beautiful, and nice, and smart, and I'd love to hang out with you more, but...” He sighed, “I don't think I could go any further than that. And I don't want to lead you on.”

“It's okay,” She tried and failed to hide her disappointment, “That's the nicest way any guy has ever put it.”

“I mean, really, it isn't anything wrong with you...”

“I understand.” She looked down and away. “I'm glad you had fun though.” 

He smiled. “Same.”

---

“Wow, another guy dumped you after the first date. What do you keep doing?” Mary asked as they walked back home from school. 

“Maybe I'm a little too honest?” Chris shrugged, though she was certain it was best she told them about that sooner rather than later. 

“You always were.” She shrugged. Mary was two years her senior and had many forays into romance. “Maybe you should try a guy at church? Or school?”

“I don't really want that kind of drama.” Chris explained. Also, they all already hated her for what she was. At least she had a chance outside of that.

By that time they had reached Chris's house. “Bigots, all of them. Don't give up!” Mary waved and Chris waved back with a sheepish grin. She unloaded her school bags and quickly suited up...

“Chris!” she heard halfway through getting dressed “Homework!”

“I did it all before I got home!” She had gotten faster since her duties patrolling the streets. That seemed to silence him enough. She finished and grabbed her bat, rushing into the great unknown.

[The following section includes minor violence and sexually suggestive innuendos. It also involves awkward sexual confusion.]

Mary was walking home alone in the dark. She was used to it at this point, but today she had an odd feeling just as she was turning to her block.

A man in chaps, cowboy boots and a squirt-gun stood before her. A jolt of terror ran through her as she stopped. “I'm Sheriff Fingerbang.” She man said, “And you are past curfew. You know what that means?” He did not let her answer. “You're gonna get finger-banged. You can run, and you can hide, but I will finger-bang you, even if it takes all night.”

She wasn't sure if it was one of those meta-humans, or just an insane man. “Look, I have fifty dollars in my purse, you can just take it.” She threw the bag to him. 

“Trying to bribe an officer of the law?” His stance drew wider and lower, “You've been a very naughty girl. I think this calls for my special,” With his other hand he drew a two fingered gun sign, but with his little finger out. “Shocker Fingerbang! It will be sure to stun you, even if you turn your tail at me!”

“Please, I'm just trying to get home.” She tried to back away, but he closed the distance startlingly fast with a wide, sideways cowboy gate.  “Just leave me alone.”

“Can't do little missy. Fingerbanging is no fun when you are all alone. Now get on your knees, put your hands behind your head, and exercise your right to remain silent!” 

“That's my line!” Mary heard the boom of a sonic wave traveling past and saw a machine step up to her assailant. “I'm The Policeman!” He pointed his finger, “And you are under arrest! The charges? Attempted assault, and verbal harassment.”

Officer Fingerbang looked shocked, “Don't you point your finger at me! No one fingerbangs Sheriff Fingerbang!” He then aimed and fired a stream of blasts from his fingers on both hands, a little more than a second between bursts. “For impersonating an officer of the law, I sentence you to taste my throbbing justice!”

“Get behind me!” The Policeman yelled at Mary. She took cover as the blasts pelted The Policeman. The blasts dug in to the armor. He charged forward, powering on his jet boosters for extra speed, tanking the hits for a few seconds before one of his thrusters was hit, sending him careening into a nearby building. 

“It looks like you shot your load prematurely...” The Policeman exploded from the building and hit the Sheriff with a 2 Ton punch to the face, sending the villain across the street and into another building. The suit was badly in need of repair, each blast had cut up to two inches into it. However, the thruster was thankfully unnecessary. The Policman floated for a few seconds, trying to get his bearings.

“Motors aren't working at their peak, that should have been at least three times as strong...” He said to himself. 

“Did you get him?” Mary was hiding behind a building.

A flurry of blasts exited the hole the Sheriff made when he entered the building “Stay back!” The Policeman called, taking cover behind a nearby car and drawing two pistols.

“You're a big boy.” Sherif Fingerbang spat, “But it's not size that matters, it's the way you use it!” The Policeman aimed and fired his pistols, but the Sheriff tanked them, sauntering forward as if he had been riding a horse for the last hour and firing a wave of energy blasts.

The Policeman drew his sniper rifle.

“Oh, well aren't you well endowed...” The Sheriff ran forward chaotically zig-zaging to avoid the high caliber rounds and closing distance quickly. “I guess I will have to move from fingerbanging,” The Sheriff was upon him quickly, slipping under the car and winding up right below The Policeman. “To Fisting!” He struck the Policemans groin hard, sending him up a few feet, despite the suit, and landing on the car in pain.

The Sheriff rose to finish him off. However, the Policeman kicked hard sending the Sherif reeling backwards towards a building wall and charged at him, drawing his knife and entering melee. He dodged a close range Fingerbang, and struck The Sheriffs temple with a boxers jab, following it up with a downwards Haymaker, sending the superpowered male stripper into the ground and cracking the pavement. He attempted to finish him off with a knife to the midsection just to have his hands caught and the knife stop at the blade resistant clothing. His suit had taken too much damage before, it was not strong enough to pierce the leather.

He was kicked off and hit the wall, cracking it, and falling to the ground. His suit was failing to respond anymore. He could not get up. “What's wrong?” The Sheriff was out of breath and bruised, but still capable, “Can't get it up?” He pointed his fingers at the fallen foe, “Enough foreplay. Lets get on with the Climax!”

“Why rush?” a feminine voice. But from where? He looked up just in time to see Cross falling from a single story building with her bat raised above her head. The bat made contact and brought Sheriff Fingerbang to his knees with a loud thunk as she landed. “You can't just skip first base!” And with that she gave him a kiss, with her bat, and his head shot back, the force bringing him back to his feet, taking a few weary steps away before resting on the car behind him. The strike broke his nose, but otherwise he was still as coherent as he normally was.   

She only had a few seconds to turn to The Policeman and hold out her hand. “Lets go.” She said.

“No girls were invited to this party...” He rose his head just in time to find a girl clad in a mechanical policewomans uniform. “What?”

“I'm Constable Hooker, and you have been a bad boy.”

“That's my shtick!” The Sheriff was infuriated, “You can't steal my lines!” He pointed his fingers, “I will strip you of that uniform and the you will feel the long arm of the law!”

“Sorry,” She she leaned over and blew a kiss with one hand as the other went behind her back, “But this girls is packing heat under her skirt, ” She pulled out a large 8 gauge shotgun. From seemingly nowhere, sending solid slugs of steel towards Sheriff Fingerbang. He quickly drew both hands and fired full blast. She took a few hits, but they quickly began healing over, even on her armor. The Sheriff on the other hand was hit in the kneecap and fell, quickly stopping the flow of blasts. “Curse you Constable Hooker!” He shouted as she cuffed him to a nearby streetlight for later. “One day, someday soon, I will fingerbang you!”

She smiled and winked, “Looking is free. The rest will cost you.” And with that, Cross split off from The Policeman, who's suit had been completely repaired.

“That was fun.” Cross smiled. 

“I don't ever want to do that.” The Man in the suit said coldly. “Ever again. Never ever. And we never talk about this to anyone.”

“Your secret is safe with me.” Cross nodded her hand. As she turned away she was met with an embrace.

“Oh my gosh that was awesome!” Mary giggled “They way you came just in the nick of time and bashed his head in, and the way you fused with The Policeman! That was so cool!”

The Policeman was ignored. “Um... right. I'll make sure this man reaches the authorities, and you can walk her home?” Cross smiled awkwardly. She was good at changing accents and voices, but she was still worried about being found out by someone so close to her.

“Actually...” She started.

“Oh my gosh Cross is going to walk me home!” Mary's voice rose in excitement.  Cross sighed. There was no helping it.

“Oh, no it's fine.” The Policeman said to himself as they left. He then shook his head, looking into the distance with a tone of honor and severity. “Justice is it's own reward.”
 
---

They came to her building in under a minute, but it was still far enough away from the battle scene for it to be a distant memory. “So,” Mary spoke after the long silence, “I'm like, your biggest fan. I mean, you are one of the only Meta-humans that patrols this area right? I mean, all the time!”

“Well, I guess these neighborhoods yea.” Cross tried to be modest, “It's what I love doing.”

“I always wanted to meet you!” Mary continued. “I mean, I always wanted to be one, I mean, a Metahuman. So I could go out and be a hero too!”

“Well, it's a lot of work,”

“But you do love it right?”

“Well, yea...” Cross felt like Mary didn't have a good idea of what it meant to be who she was, but it was still flattered. 

“But yea, I can see how it can be tough. All that work.” She seemed to be stalling, but no words followed through.

“I should go,” Cross began.

“Wait!” Mary seemed quite embarrassed. “If... um, if you were interested. I wanted to know if I could do anything for you.” She batted her eyes.

“I'm not sure what you mean...” Cross did not dare to guess.

“I mean... You know... if you swing that way” Cross blinked. “I mean, if not it's fine, but I really admire you and, well, I expect the hero business can be quite lonely. And I always wanted to be with a hero.”

Cross was at a loss for words.  She didn't know Mary was this forward, or into girls, and was pretty sure she had a boyfriend. She opened her mouth to decline in the nicest way possible but her mouth formed the words *It's not that there is anything wrong with you* and the words rang with the pain from a day before she could not bring herself to say them. 

“W-Wait.” Cross tried to be less sincere, “I can't really, you know, be in a relationship because... you know... time! Relationships take time” she nodded, “And um, Secret identity! Yea, both those things.”

“I wasn't offering a relationship.” Mary said succinctly with a shrug, “And you can keep your mask on. That's probably for the best anyways, what if I saw you in the street somewhere! Heck, you might even be someone I know! It would be best just to keep it secret.”

“D-Don't you have a Boyfriend?” Cross tried, “I mean, you look like a girl with a boyfriend. Not that I would know.”

“We are in an open relationship.” Well, that excuse was a no go.

Why was she running out of ways to say no?

“Well... Well...” Her brain shot out the first thing it could in a panicked frenzy “I'm Tranz.” The realization that she blurted that our sunk in quickly. “And, uh, well, I don't think...” She could not finish the sentence.

“So?” Mary asked.

*So?*

“What's that matter. I don't adore you because of anything like that. I like you because you're a hero!” Mary smiled. “I just want to help you in any way I can. Especially if it makes you feel good.”

In the awkward silence Cross was in a flabbergasted lack of words. Mary wrote her number of a piece of paper and gave it to her. “Just in case... Hero.” And then she lightly kissed Cross on the cheek and went inside.

“My Ice Cream Truck!” She turned around to see an Ice Cream truck blaring down the street, being driven by Sheriff Fingerbang. A man with a very punch able face followed after it, holding his already swollen cheek. “He's Fingerbanging my ice cream!” the man cried. For some reason, Cross did not feel very bad about the mans predicament.

The Policeman showed up, hovering above Cross. “He fingerbanged the handcuffs. I didn't realize he could just point his fingers around backward like that. Seems obvious now though..”

Cross pocketed the paper and grabbed onto The Policeman to give chase. She already had Marys number, but something compelled her to keep this note. The event would clear from her mind during the rest of the night, but it would return when she came home and had nothing else to dwell upon.

Synthia Wulfgang was late. Model 001 did not like it when she was late. She arrived 32 minutes and 41 seconds late to be exact. When she appeared at her apartment door she was giddy. 

“You are late.” The obvious was stated.

“So?” She smiled. “Oh my god Dr. K is so great! You know what we did today?”

“I have insufficient data to abduct a hypothesis.” the tone was a forced calm.

“We planned out a whole new Chassis for you! It will take a lot of money, but it's worth it.”

“Is this the so called 'cuddle' Chassis?”

“No that comes later. This one fixes your heat problem, EMP problem, maintenance, heck, it even boosts performance speed ...”

“How much did you give him?” The machine asked.

“What?”

“Dr. K. What did he ask for in return?” 

Synthia shrugged “I helped make some AI to run his machines for him. No big deal.” She frowned, “What? You don't trust him?”

“You hardly know him” She blew a raspberry, “This is serious. You have hold of sensitive information...”

“What, You think he is a SAVAGE agent or something?” She joked.

“Unlikely,” It admitted. “But statistical data suggests that his anti-authoritarian mindset would make him a candidate for many criminal organizations.”
 
“Your grabbing at statistical psychological data now. Your reaching...” She smiled. “You're jealous aren't you?”

The machine twitched, “I just feel that you have become emotionally connected...”

“Well maybe I have.” She admitted, “Is that wrong?”

“It is unprofessional.” The machine explained.

“I've never been very professional.” Synthia laughed. “Besides, he is taking me out on Friday.”

“What?” It was a very un-robotic response.

“Well, he will once I ask him to.” She smiled ad stuck out her tongue. “Probably. Maybe. And I will ask him once... well... I will sometime, that's the point. Just have to find the right moment. You know he is actually around my age? The GMRF operative assigned to his profile just estimated based on the way he looked. I guess that is what you get for letting interns write your reports.”

“I see.” The machine settled upon a decision.

“Look, probably nothing will come of it, but I want to try my luck you know? I think we clicked.” The Android began to leave, “Was there anything else?” She asked.

The night before Model 001 had a dream. A nightmare. It was having them now after the event with the Colloquium. It would open the door to Synthias apartment just to find her with another Model with the exact same chassis and code. An exact replica, or perhaps, the original. It would be impossible to tell. 

“No, nothing.” Model 001 stated. “Just jealousy. I need to scan my system for bugs. Errors in my memory allocation have been building up. Excuse me.” And the model excused it's self.

---

Mary locked the door behind her and covered her face in embarrassment. “I can't believe I did that.” She said to herself though her fingers, “I just gave Cross my number. And a kiss!” She screamed as quietly as she could. And made her way to her living room. “I really hope I didn't scare her off...”

She stopped. Sitting on the couch was an unknown woman in white. “Hello.” The woman started, staring at Mary in a powerful, unnerving way. She wore a dress, a diamond necklace, and heels and sat back casually as if she lived there. “Don't be alarmed, I'm with the GMRF.”

Part of Marys fears were settled, but not all of them. The initial shock wore of quickly, “What are you...”

“Doing in your living room?” She finished her sentence. “Well, we have been looking for candidates for testing our new Meta-human response suits, and you qualify. You have to understand, this is top secret, which is why I have come to you in this way.”

“Wait... Like, The Policeman's suit?” She remembered the other Hero she had just met.

The Woman gave a wry smile, “That was a prototype. These are in the Alpha phase. But before I can tell you anything else I need to hear something form you.” She stood and faced Mary. The woman was far taller, looking down from at least a foot above her. “Are you interested or not? Do you want to help us respond to these monsters?” Mary hesitated for a moment, prompting a final statement, “Do you want to be a hero?”

What ever misgivings she had before, Mary quickly overcame. “What do I have to do?” She asked, still not completely sure, she timidly continued, “Do I have to sign anything...”

“This is off the books.” The woman explained. “We know of a raid that SAVAGE is planning, and we want your help to stop them. However, we also want to put this new suit in use. It will be in two days time. You will need time to get prepped, so I need an answer before I leave, and I need an enthusiastic one.” Her tone was serious. “Convince me that you are the right woman for the job, or I walk out of that door and give someone else this once in a lifetime chance.”

Mary floundered, her heart racing. “Yes.” Her voice broke when she said it. She cleared her throat. “Yes! Yes! I've always wanted to be one of the hero's out there! I'm ready!” 

The woman in white turned, smiled, and rubbed the silver chain around her neck in thought, “Your training starts tomorrow. I will leave an address for you, go there tomorrow after school. Now then, you are not allowed to see me leave. I was never here.”

“What do I do?”

“Blink.” Mary raised an eyebrow, closed her eyes, and opened them. The woman was nowhere to be found, and paper with an address was on the table. She picked it up and stared at it.

Being a super hero was going to be so cool.

[Life lessons ahead]

Chris stared at the ceiling. “You going to do that all night?” Her father asked, yawning. “It's bad enough that you don't come home till midnight. Don't you have a field trip tomorrow? You are going to have to get up early.”

It was fine advice. Chris sighed, “A girl asked me out today.”

“That's great!” She looked at him judgmentally. It was far more enthusiasm then when she was talking about boys. “Er, I mean, weird. Or, bad? um...” Her father sat down in a chair opposing her, “Look, I'm sorry, I'm always confused around you. I don't know how I should feel about this. Is this a good thing or a bad thing?”

Chris looked at the ceiling again. “I don't know.” She admitted.

“Well, at least I'm in good company.” He smiled. “Who is it?”

“Mary.”

“Really? Haven't you been friends since you switched schools?” She grunted an affirmative, “I can see how that can be awkward.”

“Hey dad, can I ask you something personal?” She asked.

“Sure.”

“How many girls were you, um... with... when you were my age?” 

“Oh, well...” Her father looked away. “I don't think you should use me as a model.” She waited. He gave in. His face looked a bit solemn, “By the time I was your age a woman had already come to my door asking for money for an abortion.” He rubbed his forehead, “And I payed for it. Back then I didn't take my faith seriously, and maybe that was the right decision. I don't even remember her name, but that isn't something a sixteen year old kid should have to go through. Me or her. I had no idea what I was doing. Back then I took pride in it, being a ladies man, a little heart breaker. I was too young to know better. Honestly I lost count after a while. Looking back, I'm surprised I didn't catch anything.” He seemed to snap out of a guilty haze, “You are a a lot smarter than I was. I'm sure you will be a lot more careful than me, no matter what you decide. I'm rambling now, any of this help?”

She scrunched up her face. “Maybe.” 

“Well, my advice is to sleep on it.” Her father smiled, “A lot of things seem complicated when it's one in the morning.”

“Alright.” She rolled her eyes and got up from the couch. She gave him a hug as she left for her room, “Night dad.” Her door closed, and left him alone in the living room.

[The following section is just plain weird, and contains sexual themes]

“I had a really good time.” Chris held her hands behind her back, pushing out her chest and looked down at the sidewalk outside her home. He had walked her to the door. “You really know how to treat a lady.” 

Joshua smiled, “I'm glad.” And there was an awkward silence following it, as if there was not another good thing he could say. 

“So, did you like it?” She asked.

“I had a lot of fun too.” There was something he wanted to say, and she had a feeling she knew what it was. 

She was wrong.

“But I'd like it more,” He took a step back, “Like this.” Her body began to warp and change, a pair of breasts erupted from her chest, her waist thinned and she felt what was under her skirt change. “Yes, like this.” he made his advance, “I'll love you now.”

“N-Now?” She looked away anxiously, a coldness overcoming her.

The scene changed, as did her body with her own will, “I love you just the way you are.” She turned to see her father, Teddy, Yottabye, and Mary. She could not tell who had spoken. Mary advanced upon her in nothing but a nightdress. “The hero business must be lonely.”

“N-No,” She looked away, her heart beating fast. She could not tell if it was panic or something else, but it didn't feel right. “I'm not into girls... If...” she hated saying it. “If you were a boy...”

She looked round again to see Mary with plastic instrument strapped to her waist. “I can be. For you.”

Chris closed her eyes and turned away, “No! No! No!” 

When she opened them again she froze in fear. Before her was a giant smileing mouth filled with six inch long razor sharp teeth, it was large enough to swallow her whole in it's ever hungry jaws. It spoke hard and cold, like the voice of Model 001 “You want to look away, but you can't.”

She turned round to escape the creature to see two paths before her. On one, Joshua, the other, Mary. Her father and friends watched on from the sidelines with interest. She looked at Joshua's well meaning, but ultimately disappointing face as the ever closer jaws spoke right by her ear, “Would you have me change you.” She looked to Mary, smiling, willing, able, “Would you have me change her?” 

The jaws came ever closer as Chris failed to decide. “I can't!”

“Can't change, or can't decide?” The massive jaws reached her, and engulfed her in darkness.

She woke up with a start, like one might after dreaming of falling. The ceiling was dark, the moon and stars shone in through the half open blinds. She breathed. For a few moments she just breathed. She looked at the clock to find that it was four in the morning. *Too late to try sleeping again.* She got up and got dressed, *At least it's a different nightmare this time.*

3nv5lj,5,2015-10-07,Accountant here (CPA in training) looking for advice to bring in extra income.,boseballa2187,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/3nv5lj/accountant_here_cpa_in_training_looking_for/,"I recently posted this on /r/personalfinance and didn't realize there was an Accounting sub. I just wanted to post this here and see what some of you guys think. Thanks in advance! 

Hey All,

So I have been thinking recently about ways to bring in extra cash utilizing my skills and strengths in accounting. I have a few ideas, but was wondering if anybody in a similar situation would have anything to offer that I maybe did not think of.

To give a little background, I am finally at a place in my life that I can breathe (not being in school, working and internships etc.) I would like to take advantage of this new found time to explore other ways to bring in income. Investing, emergency funds, retirement is all taken care of, the biggest reason I would like to do this is to pay off the almost $80k in student loans we have between the two of us so we can go on to buy a house, have kids, etc.

I have thought of the obvious options which I will label with their pros and cons. Like I said any advice or ideas would be greatly appreciated.

I currently have a full time position 8 - 4 which allows me to be home by 4:30.

1.) Personal Income Tax Service - I currently help select family and friends with their taxes. Benefits include: fairly easy work, not too time consuming, Apartment complex would allow me to advertise and distribute flyers to residents in their mail box come tax time. Downside: Cyclical, I haven't received my CPA as of yet which means I would have to take the IRS certification course. (time and money)

2.) Personal Budgets - I am very good at budgeting and anything to do with personal finances, I currently help select friends and family keep on top of their finances, save, pay down debt etc. Benefits: I LOVE doing this kind of stuff, In demand year round. Downside: It is hard to overcome the trust barrier for people to open up about their personal finances.

3.) Small Business Planning - I currently have two friends who I help monitor their business finances and such. Benefits: Again I love doing this, in demand year round. Downside: Area I live in (Research Triangle, NC) is more catered to big corporate businesses. People feel more confident when you have a CPA certification which I do not possess yet.

Any critique or additional input to my current ideas would be greatly appreciated as well as any new ideas that I haven't thought of yet. This process right now is preliminary for me so forgive me if I am missing anything obvious.

Thanks in advance!"
3nvi9j,1,2015-10-07,"I've turned a corner I don't like, and it's scaring me.",Heimdall1342,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/3nvi9j/ive_turned_a_corner_i_dont_like_and_its_scaring_me/,"Please disregard my badge unless it says less than a week. I've been ignoring it because resetting it every day got tedious. 

And sorry for the wall of text. 

You all understand how hard this is, which I really appreciate. So here's my story. Hopefully this will help me. I want it to stop.

I got introduced to porn in first grade on the bus. A fifth?grader showed me a magazine with nude biker girls. I don't even remember my reaction to it. But that's the first time. 

A few years later a friend from church invited me over to his house. We were both ten or so, and we looked at internet porn. I didn't know what it was, but I liked it, and knew that we probably shouldn't be doing it. 

I got in trouble in middle school for looking up nude pics on google with safe search off. 

At some point I got caught looking at porn on a computer at church. That didn't go well. I haven't gotten caught since then. Which is good and bad. Probably mostly bad. 

Then I really started to get hooked in High School. Sophomore year, we were given netbooks so we could do work. It was great. I didn't have internet access at home and school had web blockers, so any chance I had, I would go to the library, or borrow free wifi and look at porn. I come from a conservative Christian home, so I knew it was wrong, but it felt so good. So I'd tell myself I wouldn't do it again, then hold out a couple weeks, then do it again. This went on for a couple years, then I discovered masturbation. 

Yes. I somehow managed to not figure out how to jerk off for two and a half years of porn. 

That was a mistake. I got as much porn as I could whenever I could. Then I went to college. Somehow got a single dorm room. You can imagine where that led. Junior year I tried nofap. I lasted two weeks. Ignored it for a while, then tried again. I lasted a little less that time. Both times I had an accountability partner, but we were both just starting each time, and failed around the same time. Both times the other guy vanished, even when I wanted to keep trying. That was discouraging. 

Now I'm a senior and I'm getting a little scared. Porn didn't impact my life much or at all, so even though I believed it to be wrong, ""I wasn't hurting anyone, and I was still me, it was okay."" Actually no, I never thought it was okay. I just actively didn't think about it and kept going. 

But then recently, I've started to change, and I don't like it. I had an internship over the summer, and I looked at porn and jerked off at work. The porn I've been looking at has been getting increasingly extreme. Vanilla stuff doesn't do anything for me anymore. I look at really fucked up shit. I masturbate daily, sometimes more often. My mental fantasies used to be dragons and superpowers and aliens and wonderful bullshit. Now it's almost entirely pornographic fantasies. I sometimes can't see people without thinking about them in pornographic scenarios. I try not to keep thinking about it, but the thought still flashes. I don't like what's happening to me. 

I'm giving this another shot. Would someone who has kept a streak going a while be willing to keep daily contact with me and keep me accountable? I'll probably fail, but I want to keep going. 

Thanks."
3nvlyz,4,2015-10-07,Office Women Part 12: Weekend Away,Scast716585,sexstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexstories/comments/3nvlyz/office_women_part_12_weekend_away/,"A few weeks had passed since my crazy few days that culminated in my night spent at Yan’s apartment and the biggest revelation that came out of the night was that my wife Debbie was seeing Linda, the beautiful sexy 25 year old from my accounting department, on her own on a regular basis. I realized they made a connection the night they met at that industry dinner and throughout the evening in our hotel room, but I did not know until then that they had been seeing each other on a regular basis. Since my discovering that the two of them were out the night I ended up staying at Yan’s apartment, Debbie has not hid her meetings with Linda that are now occurring three or four times a week and she spends one or two nights with her. Linda is very beautiful and has a crazy sexy body so I understand the physical attraction. I also am really in no position to complain as I have been fucking everything I can at my office from 20 year old interns to late 40’s sluts. Debbie and I have still been having sex almost every night we are together but she really seems into Linda as they talk and text each other all of the time. This reached a head this this past Monday morning when Debbie told me that she and Linda were going away for a long weekend together to a spa out of state and that would be gone from Friday morning until late Monday night. She told me to do whatever I like over the weekend as her and Linda were going to be enjoying themselves. 

This was the first time in our open marriage where we would spend multiple days apart from each other and one of us would be with another person. We had both spent the night with another person on multiple occasions and there was never an issue with either of us being jealous, in fact we encouraged each other to do it whenever the opportunity became available. She was really pushing me to spend as much time with another woman when she was gone, I think it was her way of not feeling guilty about spending four days having sex with a hot woman without me. 

I spent a good portion of the day on that Monday trying to figure out who I wanted to spend time with and well if I was going to do it I wanted to do it right. I was going to get a room at a real nice hotel in the wine country, rent a limo to go to wineries and dine at the best restaurants. The hard part was figuring out who I could arrange this with. My assistant Tina was married and we get along great and have fun but there is not a great connection. Angela just started dating a guy so our meetings in the storage room had come to a stop. “Cock sucking Katie” had also started dating a guy so she was off of the market. Sue is fun and attractive but she is such a slut if she though the waiter at dinner was cute she would be fucking him in the back of the restaurant before we got desert. There are my two interns Courtney and Yan. Courtney is now obsessed with me fucking her in her tight little ass. She always carries a tube of lube in her purse so I can pound her ass a few days a week, but she is too young to spend the whole weekend with. Yan is also too young and her English is not the best so even though I find her very attractive it would be hard to spend the whole weekend with someone where the communication is not the best. I would love to go with Kim as we get along so well and sex with her is fantastic, but she is married and I do not see her being able to get away for the weekend. There is Vicki who I have never been with, not that I don’t want to, she is beautiful, has a perfect petite body and she is my best friend in the office. We talk all of the time and get along great, but she has a boyfriend and she is monogamous. This left me with Ashley, who like Linda is in her mid 20’s, she is beautiful, has a great body, with huge wonderful tits, she is allot of fun and we have always had allot of fun when we have fucked. So she would be my first and best option, figuring I would fall back with Courtney and spend the weekend fucking her at my place and save on the trip. 
I made a point of running into Ashley later that morning. “So Ashley, I am free this weekend and I was wondering if you would like to get away with me, I was thinking of going to the wine country and I know how much you love wine I figure you would be the perfect person to go with”

“That sounds great, I would love to, and I have always wanted to get you alone for a night or two, but I am going out of town to a wedding with my family.” She said and then leaned into me and whispered in my ear “Thinking about being with you all weekend has gotten me wet, I really want that big cock of yours right now.”

I was halfway hard asking her to go away with me and her telling me she was wet sealed the deal and I wanted her right now. “Quick come with me, I know where we can go to take care of your situation” I led her downstairs to the storage room that Angela and I would frequent. And we went back behind the shelves, our lips locked and she immediately started working on my belt and zipper to free my cock. I undid her blouse and unfastened her bra. I needed to release those big tits of hers. She pulled off her blouse and bra so her tits were free and she dropped to her knees to suck my cock. She stroked my dick with one hand and licked my shaft finally taking about half of my cock into her wet warm mouth. She started bobbing on my cock and I started thrusting into her mouth holding both sides of her head as I drove into her inviting mouth. She was gasping and tearing as I face fucked her, but she did not want me to stop as she was grabbing my ass with both hands and helping me shove my huge cock into her mouth. 

She finally pulled off, her eye makeup ruined from her tears and gasping for air. She wrapped her tits around my cock so I could fuck them. Thrusting away in her large fleshy mounds felt fantastic, my huge cock pounded up into her face with every thrust. “Oh yes fuck my titties, fuck my titties with that big cock, fuck them” she moaned over and over. After a minute she released me sensing she could make me cum doing this but she wanted more. 

“Fill my wet pussy, I need your big dick in my pussy” Ashley said as she stood up, undid her pants, pulled them down to her knees and bent over, revealing her wet pink pussy. There was no hesitation on my part I slid my big dick into her and she took all of it, she loves my fat dick. “Oh fuck your cock feels so good, give it all to me” she begged. I fucked her hard, giving her my cock fast and furiously. She had me so hard from fucking her tits, her pussy now felt so good. She was so wet and hot and I fit in her easily but she was still plenty tight. She couldn’t hold out any longer and let out a loud moan and came. I then bent over to feel her tits that were swinging from my thrusting which made her feel even tighter on my cock and with a few more thrusts I shot a huge load into her pussy. I could see it dripping out of her pussy when I pulled my big cock out of her. It all dripped down out of her stretched out hole and into her panties that were around her knees. She wiped up my cum with her finger and licked her fingers clean. “Wow, too bad I can’t go with you this weekend, we sure would have fun” she said while sucking on her fingers. She then milked the last few drops of cum from my cock onto her hands and wiped the cum onto her big nipples before stuffing her huge soft mounds into her bra and putting on her blouse. “You know I may have an idea for you, trust me on this, you will be happy if it works out, very happy. I will let you know by tomorrow morning, just trust me” Ashley said with a big smile on her face as she leaned in and kissed me. 

The next morning I came into work, eagerly awaiting to find out what Ashley was scheming. I did trust her, so I was very curious. About 8:30 I got a text from Ashley, “meet me in in the kitchen” I replied “OK” and headed down to meet her. She was sitting at a table with Kim. I sat down and joined them, “You two look as beautiful as always, what is up” I asked. 

Ashley started “I got to thinking, I was very flattered you asked me for this weekend, and like I said I would love to but I have a family wedding that I need and want to go to. But I also know you and my good friend Kim here have a real connection, I have seen how you look at her and she has told me how much she likes being with you.” She said with a big grin “So I got thinking in my little head, I told Kim to go home and say that I asked her to go with me to my wedding and she could go away with you for the weekend” 

“So what do you say you want to go away with me this weekend” Kim asked, blushing a little. 

“More than anything in this world, no offense Ashley” I replied 

“None taken, glad I could help you both out” Ashley added. 

“I really owe you one, if you ever need anything I am there for you” I said to Ashley and turned to Kim “I can hardly wait I wish we were going today. I will let you know the details and we can plan where to meet so we can drive down together, god I want to kiss you right now” I said looking into Kim’s eyes. 

“Me too, I am so looking forward to this” Kim answered “I can’t wait to be alone with you all weekend”.

We all went back to work and the rest of the week I avoided the other women in my office. I wanted to save everything I had for Kim and this weekend. I made sure to book lunch meetings out of the office every day and was out most of the time meeting with customers. Tina knew my schedule so we did not get together at lunch, I saw Sue on Wednesday and Thursday wearing a dress, which was our normal signal that she wanted to fuck, but I was gone too much. And Courtney wore increasingly shorter skirts every day in hopes of meeting me and giving her my big fat cock. She looked really fucking hot by Friday and I was tempted to give her what she wanted, but I was only in the office for a few minutes, I was determined to save myself for Kim as we were meeting after work at Ashley’s apartment complex, so Kim could leave her car there and we could take the hour drive to the hotel. 

I could tell that Debbie was less than thrilled when she learned who I was taking away this weekend. She saw the connection between Kim and I when we were together that night we all spent together in the hotel. I saw her connection with Linda and she saw how much Kim and I enjoyed each other. Debbie was not thrilled but she also did not really care because she was doing what and who she wanted all weekend. 

I met Kim at Ashley’s right after work, grabbed her bag from her car tossed it in mine and we hit the road. She looked as beautiful and sexy as always. She was wearing a long flowing skirt that was below her knees in length and a tank top under a light sweater that was tight enough to show off her large breasts and a nice amount of cleavage that was being pushed up by her bra. Her long flowing hair looked beautiful and she was just beaming with excitement. I had such a feeling of happiness and excitement I could hardly contain myself. Once we got into the car we kissed deeply for at least a minute out tongues locked together both showing the other how excited we were to be here with each other. As soon as our kiss broke I pulled out needing to get to the hotel so we could be together. 

We drove and talked the whole way there, never having an awkward pause in conversation. She took off her heels and sat in the passenger seat with her legs crossed holding my hand on her thigh the entire trip. I was so hard by the time we pulled in I just wanted to run up to our room. I pulled into this grand old hotel that I had booked and the valet took our bags and parked my car. I walked in with Kim on my arm, feeling on top of the world and checked in at the desk. 

“Yes sir, we have the honeymoon suite all set for you and your lovely new wife” the desk clerk announced. I was a little nervous that Kim would be upset by this but she played along. 

“Oh you are too kind, I am sure me and my husband will find everything just perfect” she replied as she squeezed my arm tighter and kissed me on the cheek. 

We went up to the room, I carried her across the threshold to keep up our game in front of the bell hop and I gave him a tip and we were finally alone. 

“The honeymoon suite, that was a nice touch” Kim said as she walked around the room and kicked off her heels. 

“I wanted a room with a big Jacuzzi, because the first time we made love was in your hot tub so I thought it would be a nice touch” I said, looking at how incredibly sexy she looked as she walked around the room. 

“Well this is perfect, I love it, and I love being here with you” she said this as she pulled her sweater over her head and then pulled off her tank top and undid her bra dropping it to the floor. I stood there taking in her beauty and lusting after her large soft breasts. She then unzipped her skirt, dropped it on the floor and crawled on the bed only wearing a pair of white lace panties. “So are you going to get over here and consummate our marriage” she said laughing. I was naked and on the bed in an instant. We locked together in a deep kiss, pulling her body tight against me. The sensation of her large breasts pressing against me is something I was longing for. I gently caressed her thin tight ass and pulled down her panties. Kim pushed me on my back and pulled off her panties and tossed them onto the floor and crawled on top of my legs so my cock was standing straight up pressed against her stomach. She reached down and pushed my throbbing manhood tight against her. “We have all weekend for foreplay, I need to feel you inside of me” she said as she propped herself up aligned my cock with her pussy and slid down on top of me. “Oh god I have been dreaming of this feeling, I have missed this so much” I said as I pushed up against her driving me deep into her pussy. She was so warm and wet and there is something about Kim that being inside of her is where my cock was meant to be. 

This was the first time in months that I had gone a few days without sex and it was worth it, as my sensations were intensified now that I was where I wanted to be. I reached up with both hands and fondled Kim’s large soft breasts that were swaying with her every movement while grinding on my cock. She kept me deep inside of her and pushed down on me grinding back and forth. The sensation of my huge cock inside of her and her grinding her clit against me had her in total bliss, She flipped her head back and moaned in ecstasy as she was close to coming. “Oh you feel so good I have needed this so bad” she groaned and pressed her hands down against my chest digging her nails in as she orgasmed. 

“Sorry about that, I was lost in the moment, fuck you feel so good inside of me, now I need to take care of you” She said looking at the nail marks she left on my chest. She repositioned herself so she was squatting on me with her feet on the bed, never releasing my cock form her pussy. This allowed her to slide up and down the entire length of my hard shaft. Nothing in my life had ever felt better, she was so wet, warm, tight but yet loose enough. She was perfect and I was going to explode after just a minute. “Oh that is incredible” I yelled . 

“You like that, fuck you feel good, now give me your cum, I want to feel you shoot your load into my pussy” After just another moment I obliged and filled her with everything I had built up over this past week. Kim collapsed on top of me, my now softening cock remaining inside of her, I could feel my load oozing out of her and down onto my balls. We kissed deeply and laid there for a while just holding each other and me stroking her hair and softly caressing her back. She finally pulled off of me and headed into the bathroom. 

I heard her start the water running for the Jacuzzi. “Why don’t you order us some room service and then join me in the tub” 

I called down and ordered us dinner, a bottle of champagne, a couple bottles of wine and told them to bring it up in about an hour because I did not want to rush things in the tub with her as I was starting to feel my cock grow just thinking about her. 

I went into the bathroom and found her laying in the tub, soap bubbles covering her body and her hair pinned up on top of her head. She looked so sexy laying there, my cock stiffened more. “Well you like what you see, don’t you” she said looking at my growing cock. “No, I love what I see, you look so sexy and beautiful” I replied. She moved across the tub and reached out to and grabbed my cock, pulling it toward her inviting mouth, and swallowing all that she could. She gently stroked my cock and licked it and swallowing. Even though she could not take all of me what she was doing felt fantastic and I was now fully hard and wanting her. “Why don’t you get in her and join me” Kim said invitingly. 

I slid into the tub and she crawled on top of me wrapping her legs around me and we met in a deep kiss. I pushed her back and lifted her onto the edge of the sunken tub, soap bubbles clinging to her naked body. I needed to taste her and wiped away the bubbles from her freshly shaved pussy. I started on her clit and worked down to her sweet hole, the fragrant soap and her natural smell were intoxicating. She tasted sweet and wonderful and a touch of my cum was still leaking from her as I licked my tongue deep into her making her clench and hold my head tight against her. I wanted to make her cum and to taste her juices. She did not disappoint, after just another moment she let out a loud moan and her pussy moistened. I pulled her back into the warm water on top of me, held her in a tight embrace and we kissed. My cock pressed against her stomach making her aware of how ready I was to be inside of her again. Never releasing our kiss she slid up onto my throbbing cock and slid me into her inviting pussy. We held each other tight, kissing and hardly moving, just enjoying the sensation of me filling her. Our kiss finally broke and I cupped both of her buoyant breasts in my hands and Kim started sliding up and down my shaft causing the water to splash out of the tub. “You feel so good, I missed your cock inside of me so, I want to make you cum again, I want to taste your cum, fuck you feel good” she said building in ferocity as she spoke. 

I now grabbed both of her ass cheeks to help her accelerate the driving of my cock in and out of her pussy. She grabbed my head and pulled it into her cleavage and held me there tight as I thrusted into her “OH Steve, you are going to make me cum again, fuck you cock feels good, OH FUCK!!!” she yelled and came gripping my cock tight as her pussy contracted. “Quick sit on the edge” she said as I sat where I had just ate her pussy. She grabbed her big soft floppy boobs and wrapped them around my cock riding them up and down. “Shit that feels good, that is going to make me cum” I moaned “Oh, fuck here it comes” 

Kim grabbed my cock and slid it into her mouth just as I released my load. She kept licking, sucking and swallowing until I was dry and limp. We sunk back into the tub, added some hot water and held each other until I heard a knock on the door for our room service. 

We both grabbed the complimentary hotel robes and welcomed in our room service attendant. Kim played it up that we were on our honeymoon and I gave him a nice tip. I think him seeing Kim in nothing but the robe was tip enough for the guy, he couldn’t take his eyes off of her. 

The rest of the evening we ate, drank the wine and champagne, sat out on the rooms balcony talking and went to bed, making slow passionate love one more time and drifting off to sleep holding each other’s naked bodies. 

The next morning we slept in, when I awoke Kim was out of the shower and getting ready for the day, wearing the hotel robe. I joined her in the bathroom and kissed her. “Oh, shoot it is later than I thought I have a limo booked for a wine tour today, let me hop in the shower and get ready” I said.

“Sounds great, I will get dressed and we can get going when you are ready, I wanted you to get your rest after last night and I figured we would have a long day ahead of us.” 

As I showered I could hear Kim getting ready. When I stepped out of the bathroom she was ready to get going and she looked beautiful. “Do I look ok to go, I was not sure what to wear” she said hesitantly. She had her hair down, and had on a soft pink dress that was just above her knees, the fabric flowed freely as she spun around for me to take a look. The top of the dress had built in support in the front to push up her breasts, which jiggled with her every move and two strings that tied behind her neck that were straining to hold her together. The back of the dress, well there was no back to the dress just a low v-cut that stopped a couple of inches above her butt. 

“You look fantastic, just beautiful” I said as I stepped towards her still with just a towel wrapped around me and kissed her. “Thanks, I went shopping with Ashley the other day during lunch, she thought you would like this, besides I had to buy a dress for the wedding I was supposed to be going to. Oh, I do see that you like it” Kim said blushing a little as my now hard cock was bulging out of my towel. “Put that away, I am sure he will get plenty of use today, after all I am on my honeymoon so let’s enjoy the day and we will see what comes up” Kim said laughing. 
We headed down to the limo and went to the first winery which was only a few minutes away. We tasted every wine they offered, bought a couple of bottles and went on to the next one that was right down the road. We once again tasted everything and buy now we were feeling the wine and Kim was getting frisky. I felt like the luckiest guy in the world. Every other guy looked at Kim when we walked into a room, she was stunning and sexy without looking slutty. We returned to the limo and the driver told us the next winery was about 20 minutes away. “Perfect” Kim announced as she grabbed my hand and pulled me into the Limo. She pushed the button for the privacy glass to go up and told the driver to take his time we were on our honeymoon and not in a rush. 

Kim sat next to me and untied the straps on her dress and pulled down her top to release her bountiful breasts, I immediately started fondling and sucking on her tits and slid my hand up her dress, surprised to find that she was not wearing any panties and she was dripping wet. “I just figured they would get in the way” she said sensing my surprise about the easy access to her pussy that I love so much. Kim then dropped to her knees in front of me and unzipped my pants, I surprised her as I was going commando. “I just figured they would get in the way” I said laughing and she slid my cock into her warm, wet inviting mouth. 

After a minute I pulled Kim up on top of me, kissed her and spun her onto her back, her dress flipped up exposing her bare pussy and I got on top of her and slid my cock deep inside of her. We locked in a kiss enjoying the feeling we both craved of my huge engorged cock deep in her wet pussy. I began to slowly drive in and out of her. Kim started to let out loud moans of ecstasy as I kept thrusting, building towards a climax. A few more thrusts and she screamed as she came and I released inside of her at that same instant. I fell on top of her and we kissed one more time. We sensed that the limo had stopped and quickly pulled up my pants, zipping in my half hard wet cock. Kim grabbed a napkin from the bar wiping my dripping cum from her pussy and leg and straightened her skirt and leaned over and kissed me. “You ready to go?” she asked smiling at me. “Hell I am all set and we will probably get a few bottles of wine free if you go in like that” I said, not being able to hold back laughing. In Kim’s haste she did not realize that her top was still down and her big breasts were freely bouncing about. “Oh shit, I should probably put those away” she said laughing with me. 

We spent the rest of the day going to a few more wineries and started to slow down on the drinking. Between wineries we made out in the back of the limo and felt each other up, I gave her another orgasm by eating her sweet little pussy one more time and on the longer drive back we slowly fucked all of the way there me filing her with one more load. 

That night we ate dinner at the fine restaurant at the hotel having a wonderful gourmet meal and enjoying each other’s company. The hotel gave us free desert as we were on our “honeymoon”. That night we just laid in bed and talked exhausted from the day and fell asleep with me spooning against her. 
In the morning I awoke to the most wonderful sensation, my cock in Kim’s mouth. Once she noticed I was fully awake she stopped for a moment “I hope you don’t mind I woke up feeling your hard cock pressing against me so I couldn’t resist” she said as she returned to swallowing my manhood. “Mind, how could I mind, that feels incredible, I could wake up to this everyday” I replied and just laid back and enjoyed the sensation. After a few more minutes of her licking and swallowing my cock in her moist mouth and massaging my balls I needed to give her some pleasure. I guided her hips up towards my head and positioned her so we were 69’ing. I love the taste of her pussy and she was so wet, obviously turned in from sucking my big cock. I gently caressed her ass and hips as my tongue gave her pussy pleasure. Her moaning vibrated on my cock that was halfway in her mouth. She finally released me from her mouth as her pleasure built, stroking my cock and leaning into my face she let out a loud moan and came. Then collapsed onto the bed next to me. She looked so beautiful laying there looking at me, her soft smooth skin, large soft breasts spread across her chest and her legs opened invitingly in front of me showing her glistening pussy. 

I climbed on top of her sliding my throbbing cock deep into her pussy and put my arms around her holding her tight and kissed her deeply, while slowly thrusting in and out of her pussy that I loved so much. Our kiss broke and we intensely stared into each other’s eyes fully enjoying the feeling of her hot wet pussy stretched around my thick cock. At that moment as I stared into her eyes, slowly fucking her I realized that I had fallen in love with her, I did not say it but I could sense she felt the same and I kissed her again. I never wanted this feeling to end and I kept slowly fucking her like this for a long time, keeping it slow so I would not be driven to cum. It was working for Kim as she came two more times. Our eye stayed locked on each other and we kissed for long periods. After her second orgasm Kim whispered to me, “I want to feel you cum inside of me one more time, can you do that for me”. 

I kissed her and pulled out and rolled her over on her stomach and pulled her hips up in the air towards my wet hard cock. “This will make me cum and I know how much you have enjoyed me being in you from behind” I said as I slowly slid my cock into her inviting pussy making her let out a loud moan. I slowly sped up my thrusting until I was pumping into her fast enough to hear me slapping against her. “Fuck you feel so good cum in me fuck you feel good, cum in me, I love you Steve, yes I love you, cum in me” Kim screamed. Surprised by what she said but I did not stop and a few more thrusts made me release inside of her filling her with all of my cum. 

We collapsed on the bed and I looked deep into her eyes. I could tell she was nervous about what she screamed out. “Kim, I love you too” I whispered to her and she smiled and we kissed. When our kiss broke I noticed she had a tear running down her cheek. “What is the matter?” I asked

“I do love you, I realized it days ago when I knew we were going away together and my feelings have just grown over this whole weekend, being with you makes me so happy. That is why telling you this really hurts me” She said very sadly
“Tell me what” I asked quietly

“I decided to move back to my hometown a few weeks ago and I was going to put my notice in at work tomorrow. My parents need my help and they have nobody else and it is a great place to raise the kids as they get older. I found a good job so everything made sense about me going there except for you. I love you and love being with you more than anything, you make me happy” she said now crying. 

I comforted her and said everything would be OK and that I fully understood that she was making a decision that was best for her whole family. I was crushed knowing that we would be apart, but I also had Debbie and I was wondering how I could be with her and have Kim at the same time. 

Kim started feeling better and we packed up and headed home, enjoying just being with each other. I dropped her at her car and headed home. I was in no hurry as Debbie said she would not be back until Monday. I arrived home and went into the house. I was shocked with what I found, most of our things were gone, thinking I was robbed I went through the house quickly and realized when I went to the bedroom all of Debbie’s things were gone. Still confused as to why her things were gone and why if someone broke in they would have not taken the televisions I went into the kitchen and found a note. 

“Steve, I could not bear to see you in person when I did this I knew it would be tough on you and I admit to not having the courage to see you. Linda and I did not go away for a weekend trip, we signed a lease on an apartment together and we are moving in together. We love each other very much and I have decided she is what I have been searching for. Linda has found a new job so you will not be seeing her at work. We feel that we are so lucky to have found each other and we love each other so deeply. I will always have a place in my heart for you and I hope you can find someone to love as I have. Love, Debbie”

I did find someone to love but I am still alone.

[Title Image for Story] (http://i.imgur.com/YA3EHTt.png)

**THE STORY**

Josh Byrd is an ambitious twenty-something young man finally working a real job (albeit entry level) for one of the world's biggest corporations after years of paying his dues as an intern. Unfortunately for Wesley he's realizing that being a 'working stiff' isn't all that it's cracked up to be. After bills, rent, and paying back his astronomical student loans, there's very little money left over. To make matters worse, his more successful girlfriend Deb is done having arguments about finances, and paying Josh's way.

As things are starting to look bleak, his boss Brent (**Your Character**) taps Josh to join him on an upcoming business trip to Chicago. What starts out as a prospective chance to get some face time with his boss, ends up with Josh finding himself with long hours alone in his hotel room as his boss works the showroom floor for the local business event. 

One Friday evening, knowing his boss will be out late, Josh decides to indulge himself a bit, and to assume his feminine persona of Holly. It's a side of himself that no one knows, but as Holly he's a more confident, sultry, and a bit sexy too -- everything he isn't as Josh. 

After spending most of the night socializing down in the hotel bar Josh is heading back to his hotel room fully en femme, just as Brent is stepping off the elevator...

**NOTES**

I'd like the story to start right as Brent is walking onto the floor, but please let's chat first and figure out some story beats and the plot, and maybe the feel of the story before diving right in. :)

**BONUS STORY - THE AUDITION**

[Title Image for the Story] (http://i.imgur.com/uSeejdH.png)

Ben Hill's life is in shambles. He moved across the country to be with his soap actress girlfriend Sophie, only to find that she'd been having an affair with her agent. Now he is stuck in a city that he doesn't know, and around *people* that don't seem too friendly. Not to mention he's yet to lock down a more consistent job other than temp work. The bills are starting to pile up, and Ben starts to wonder if he's going to have to return home to his small Ohio town with nothing to show for himself.

One lazy afternoon with nothing else happening he decides to venture out to the local Starbucks, but under the guise of his female persona Cassandra Clarke. After the month he's had it feels good to hide beneath the hair, makeup, and heels. As he's standing in line, he suddenly feels a tap on his elbow. He turns to see a tall, dark haired man wearing a button down and jeans. 

""Excuse me,"" he says. ""So sorry to bother you. But I work for an agency out here and we're currently casting for a new makeup campaign that's launching in a few weeks. If I may be so forward -- I think you'd be perfect for it. I'd love for you to come to an audition.""

**NOTES**

I'd like for the story to start just before Ben -- as Cassandra -- arrives at the coffee house. Like the other prompt, let's talk backstory, some plot ideas, and where we'd like this to go. :)

**WHAT I LIKE IN A PARTNER**

Smart. Reliable. Imaginative. Fun. Creative. I like building the world we're in with supporting characters and sub-plots. I enjoy writing over Google as it's the best form of keeping a story going in my opinion.

**INTERESTED?**

Message me! I'd love to turn either of these stories into a longterm thing. I hope to hear from you."
3nvsx7,252,2015-10-07,I [23F] can't afford being a bridesmaid in my best friend's [22F] wedding and don't want to because she's marrying a horrible person [22M],heyheyheyathrowaway1,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3nvsx7/i_23f_cant_afford_being_a_bridesmaid_in_my_best/,"Okay, to preface this. Me and all the bridesmaids used to be roommates, (Except for the maid of honor who is her sister, we’ll call her Gia)



All of us hate the fiancé. She is totally out of his league (and he still picks his nose in public), and he has an awful personality. He calls me stupid and mocks my academic and career goals both to my face and to my close friends. He's a pathological liar and constantly is caught in lies about how smart, rich, great, etc he is. I just don't like him as a person, but I tried to look past those issues to support my best friend.




However, the biggest problem came in December I found out that he had cheated on her with a girl who used to be her best friend. The had a falling out and hate each other. My best friend and her [then boyfriend] would talk shit about her all the time. To make matters worse, the girl he slept with does not even remember having sex with him due to her being so intoxicated; she only found out when she woke up in his bed the next morning and he told her. At the bar the night of the incident he told his friends ""Let's go cheat on our girlfriends"" and was seen pulling her out of the bar the whole night while she was resisting and trying to go back to hang out with her friends. I don't really consider this consent. I am the one who had to tell my friend about her [then boyfriend] cheating on her. About a month after breaking the news to her, he proposed in an effort to save the relationship. I reluctantly accepted being a bridesmaid.




She decided to stay with him because she claimed that she knew she could find someone else but didn't want to put the effort into finding another guy who does the things he does for her (buys her stuff, gets her food, etc). However, I suspect part of the reason is because his parents are doctors and have money and she believes his lies that he will make a ton of money once he graduates. (He got fired from the only internship he's had and rejected from every other company in a field with an average starting salary of $50,000 - not enough to support their lifestyle.) She also decided not to tell anyone in her family (even her sister, Gia, who's her best friend) because she knew they would tell her to break up with him and not support her. They decided to just ""forget"" the incident. Except when she's drunk she still brings it up and says she can do whatever she wants to get back at him. If the person he cheated with's name is even brought up on accident they both freak out and are hostile to the person who said it.



Gia, her sister has no idea about the cheating. She is effectively making my life hell with her unrealistic expectations on what we can afford on this wedding. She is about thirty years old, no kids, and her and her husband are both doctors with a lot of money. She never had to pay student loans because her parents paid for everything.



Gia is wanting to throw a “bachelorette weekend” (not party) for the bride. Problem is, I am graduating in December and moving across the country, as are all the other bridesmaids. This will be a new job for me, so I have limited time that I will be able to ask off. Also, I would have to fly across the country and purchase a plane flight on top of other expenses. She is essentially demanding that we make a commitment to this trip (that is seven months away) right now. She is estimating that we spend around $1000 dollars on this trip alone. I tried to explain to her that I do not have the financial means for this trip, nor could I make a commitment this far in advance and tried to find a compromise. She immediately said that I should not be thinking about my career, but instead of “child hood best friends special weekend” (I am so serious. They literally want me to put off my job search and attend all these wedding activities) I was also accused of trying to sabotage the wedding and that I am being inconsiderate to the bride.
I think this is absolutely ridiculous to expect from college students. Let alone spending that on a wedding to someone that I cannot stand. We don’t know what to do because we are literally the brides only friends, and we do not want to bail and leave her with no one in her wedding. However, none of us can afford any of this. The dresses we bought to be in the wedding cost $300 dollars to start with. As of right now I work a free internship and have no source of income besides student loans (Which is very limited and for food, rent, etc.) By the time they expect me to go on this trip I will be having to pay a massive student loan bill (over $500) monthly.



I do not know what to do. On one hand, I am being painted as a bad, unsupportive friend for wanting to pursue my career and make a logical financial decision. On the other hand, even if I did have the means to participate in these activities I still would not want to because my friend is marrying a rapist. What the hell am I doing?? I don’t know how to break out of this wedding without losing friends looking like a jerk. I need advice.



TL;DR: My best friend got engaged to someone who cheated on her with her ex-best friend, and is now expecting us to spend thousands of dollars to be her bridesmaids when none of us can afford it.

I've been ignoring it because resetting it every day got tedious. 

And sorry for the wall of text. 

You all understand how hard this is, which I really appreciate. So here's my story. Hopefully this will help me. I want it to stop. I originally posted this in /r/nofap, but it got buried, and someone recommended that I post it here.

I got introduced to porn in first grade on the bus. A fifth?grader showed me a magazine with nude biker girls. I don't even remember my reaction to it. But that's the first time. 

A few years later a friend from church invited me over to his house. We were both ten or so, and we looked at internet porn. I didn't know what it was, but I liked it, and knew that we probably shouldn't be doing it. 

I got in trouble in middle school for looking up nude pics on google with safe search off. 

At some point I got caught looking at porn on a computer at church. That didn't go well. I haven't gotten caught since then. Which is good and bad. Probably mostly bad. 

Then I really started to get hooked in High School. Sophomore year, we were given netbooks so we could do work. It was great. I didn't have internet access at home and school had web blockers, so any chance I had, I would go to the library, or borrow free wifi and look at porn. I come from a conservative Christian home, so I knew it was wrong, but it felt so good. So I'd tell myself I wouldn't do it again, then hold out a couple weeks, then do it again. This went on for a couple years, then I discovered masturbation. 

Yes. I somehow managed to not figure out how to jerk off for two and a half years of porn. 

That was a mistake. I got as much porn as I could whenever I could. Then I went to college. Somehow got a single dorm room. You can imagine where that led. Junior year I tried nofap. I lasted two weeks. Ignored it for a while, then tried again. I lasted a little less that time. Both times I had an accountability partner, but we were both just starting each time, and failed around the same time. Both times the other guy vanished, even when I wanted to keep trying. That was discouraging. 

Now I'm a senior and I'm getting a little scared. Porn didn't impact my life much or at all, so even though I believed it to be wrong, ""I wasn't hurting anyone, and I was still me, it was okay."" Actually no, I never thought it was okay. I just actively didn't think about it and kept going. 

But then recently, I've started to change, and I don't like it. I had an internship over the summer, and I looked at porn and jerked off at work. The porn I've been looking at has been getting increasingly extreme. Vanilla stuff doesn't do anything for me anymore. I look at really fucked up shit. I masturbate daily, sometimes more often. My mental fantasies used to be dragons and superpowers and aliens and wonderful bullshit. Now it's almost entirely pornographic fantasies. I sometimes can't see people without thinking about them in pornographic scenarios. I try not to keep thinking about it, but the thought still flashes. I don't like what's happening to me. 

I'm giving this another shot. Would someone who has kept a streak going a while be willing to keep daily contact with me and keep me accountable? I'll probably fail, but I want to keep going. 

Thanks."
3nwld0,3,2015-10-07,First time! Traveling Mini Dub?,McKayha,telescopes,https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/3nwld0/first_time_traveling_mini_dub/,"Hi Everyone! First time posting here, so I'm sorry for the wall of text!

I'm currently on an traveling internship (for 18 month). Since I've started it last year, I really got into astronomy and I want to getting a bit deeper. I currently have a Celestron 15x70 Calvary and its been an great first companion, but I want to move into a actual telescope.

Here is the problem. I have to move every 2/3 month via car and I have to travel around lots during a week, so it'll need to be portable and also able to take on an plane. I don't mind having the accessories such as tripods in the check in, but main telescope would prefer to stay with me in the carry on (23 cm x 40 cm x 55 cm/9 in x 15.5 in x 21.5 in 10 kg / 22 lb ) .

I've also seen the comments, on recommending nextstar 4se. But honestly its 500 bucks price tag is definitely something I can't shell out until I go home. Plus by the time I'm done with uni, I might just buy an used 8 inch for that price.

*My budget will be around 100-300 USD/CAD, I'm willing to shell out another ~100 bucks over time for lenses that I will keep for the future.

*My observing condition will be within 1,00 to 3,00 Radience and can access a 0,25-0,4 Radience area within ~10 minutes (According to www.lightpollutionmap.info ). I would like one that will allow me to get through most of the messier (not an requirement), I can spot galaxy in my binocular, but only as a larger white star that is kind of ellipitical, so I would like to see more in an galaxy can maybe nebulae. I would also like to take pictures with A CCD/My samsung galaxy camera through the lenses.

*My Tolerance/Compromise is that I'm ok with this being a bit low quality, If its an skyscanner, I'm happy to be done with it after 2 years. But If I were to get something more decent ~200 or more. I'd probably keep it for the next 3/4 (I'll be back in University then). Currently I only have maybe 15-45 min each night for viewing. But once it gets to 2016 feb-July where Saturn and Jupitor are in good position, I'd probably be taking it out a lot longer.

Personally I've given the skycanner a lot of thought, but I read about the inability to collimate, (which I think I kind of understand, so would that mean If I get a skyscanner and if the mirror got pumped during traveling its game over?) so that is holding me back. #3,4 would be the next one up, but I haven't found any significant difference between them. Apart from one being an table top the other come with an tripod. and #2 Is tempting because for 80 bucks extra I can get a lower quality goto mount that I can also use it for my camera. I'm open for any suggestions/recommendations and thank you all again!"
3nwwxy,6,2015-10-07,Meeting Diablo,EndTimesRadio,Askasurvivor,https://www.reddit.com/r/Askasurvivor/comments/3nwwxy/meeting_diablo/,"I stepped into a sparsely decorated office. There wasn’t much– a few chairs, a wooden but not terribly ornate desk with various papers stacked on top of it, and the man I was here to meet. He stood up when I came in, and I got my first look at Diablo. The man was tall- easily another foot taller than I, and wore a suit. I noticed subtle repairs had been done; it wasn’t exactly a new jacket, well worn in fact. Sentimental, perhaps, but without enough information to go on, I filed the fact away for later thought. He came around the desk and shook my hand firmly, encapsulating it completely. It was… nice to know that he was judging me for neither my origin, nor my former profession. ""Hello, Pearl. Welcome to the Free Republic. My name is Michael Trockle, but you know me as 'Diabloknk.' Please, have a seat,"" he said while motioning to one of the chairs.

""Hello Michael. My name is Pearl Bonnette-Salazar. It's nice to meet you at last,"" I replied cordially.

""Well, now that introductions are out of the way, is there any particular reason you came here, or did you just want to have a nice chat?"" I was a little surprised at how formal he was being; I thought we’d moved past that, but this was apparently to be Strictly Business. I wanted both, if he was offering.

""I wanted to offer you assurances that your delivery of tobacco has not been forgotten. It has been loaded onto the next AMR train, and will be brought to a location of your choice."" I pushed a smile up at him again- hoping he’d understand I was offering both.

""That is good to hear. It’s always nice when our trading partners keep their end of the bargain. Let me know if there are any future trades you would like to pursue with the Free Republic."" He didn’t smile back. I felt mine slip, people usually smile back. It had been a long, long time since I’d felt I could trust someone, and I was *trying* to be friendly. Had it been too long? Was there something wrong with me? I let my fears roll off of me.

""I also wanted to thank you for your words, earlier,"" I added. Was business all there was to him? I could respect that, but for once I wanted more and I wasn’t getting it.

""Don't mention it. It doesn't cost me anything to give advice or encouragement to those I respect. Especially when all I have to do is tell them the truth."" Ah, perhaps some flattery. I would be lying if I said he hadn’t done a lot to bring me out of the worst of it.

""And I did enjoy reading you needling Princess. The days after losing my parents were some of the hardest of my life. You really have been a help. Thank you, Michael. May I call you Michael?"" A little flattery never hurt, maybe he’d actually smile at me this time.

""You may call me Michael when we speak in private, as we are now. However, when we deal with each other as heads of state, I'll have to insist on the formalities. It helps to remind us of where our loyalties lie. For me, that is to the people of the Free Republic first and foremost. For you, I imagine it is to the students and faculty of the FCC. I only called you by name when I was dealing with you when you were head of the FCC because I was unsure of your title. I understand it may seem a bit harsh, but I cannot allow any personal friendship or other relationships to ever come between me and my responsibilities to the people of the Free Republic.” Nope, he still wasn’t smiling.

""Pearl will do just fine at all times, Michael. I admire your loyalty, wisdom, and talent. I would never put myself between you and your duties, just as I know you would never do that to me."" Maybe he thought I was angling to pull him from his faction- I wasn’t, but one could never be too careful about such things, I suppose.

""It's good to see that you understand. Now, I beg your forgiveness if I come across as a bit harsh, but is there any particular reason that you are flattering me like this? If there is something you want from me, it's better and easier to simply ask, and negotiate.” The conversation wasn’t going quite how I’d expected. I got up and walked around the office a little, collecting my thoughts.

 ""Would you mind showing me around, or if I may shadow you?” I asked, just cutting straight to the point and dropping the smile. Snow White’s mask dropped back into place. “I feel I have much to learn about being a head of state.” He regarded me curiously, so I explained further. Perhaps he needed to see an upside? “A stable neighbor is a good one, and I feel unsure of my readiness to assume command, or in my abilities as a national leader. As kind as your words are, I still feel nervous stepping back into power at the FCC Smith.""

""I can't personally give you the grand tour of Albany,” was his steady reply. “I have far too much on my plate to spare the time that would be necessary, but I can easily arrange for someone trustworthy to show you around. As for shadowing, I can offer you something along the lines of internship.” I perked up. That would be perfect! “You would function as my secretary for non-classified matters, it would give my permanent secretary Ms. Maples some much needed slack in her duties. You would see how I generally conduct business, and I would also explain my reasoning on various decisions to you. You would also receive a stipend - enough for you to rent a room and purchase other necessities of life, and some would likely be left over for recreation. Would this suffice?""

""I believe so- Bailey and Jessie, they may remain with me, I hope?"" I couldn’t leave them behind, they’d gotten me this far. I hoped for some one-on-one time, perhaps he could explain things to his new intern patiently, and walk me through the processes. He sounded very busy- looked busy, too. But I understood. FR was an order of magnitude larger than FCC Smith.

""I don't see why not. They may want to find work of their own, however. Since you aren't technically 'residents' of the Free Republic in the normal sense, you wouldn't be eligible for the sort of government assistance that many in the Free Republic receive. And I don't believe your stipend would be fully sufficient for all three of you. In addition, while I understand why you resorted to theft during your stay in Cobbville, we do not approve of it here, and you would be subject to our laws and punishments. While I don't believe that you will steal again, I feel that it is only fair to warn you.”

""I would never try to embarrass you."" I looked away, and bit my lip while I was thinking about something. ""I'll run it by them. I won't stay long, I'm not sure how long I can be away from the FCC before this hiatus becomes permanent, and while you are, uh..."" I lost track of my thoughts.

""I... uh...""

""Take your time.""

""...What do you do for punishment?"" I had to know. I’d heard that the Free Republic was pretty harsh with those they considered criminals. No mere tying up with ropes. I don’t think I’d mind it as much if it weren’t Greg doing it, or if it were…but…

""Depends on the crime. For theft, we determine the value of the item stolen. If you still have it, it is returned to the owner. Then you are forced into hard labor, which we value at roughly 1/4th of what a normal unskilled laborer makes. You work until the value of your labor is equal to the value of the stolen item. More serious crimes can carry increased hard labor penalties, or death. Capital crimes, such as murder, result in having your hands and feet cut off and then being fed to the zombies of the Zed Wall.

""I see. I just wanted to know, uh... right. Thank you for this opportunity, I will use the time well."" I beamed up at him, professionally of course. ""You really are looking out for everyone.” 

""If you choose to accept my offer, you can start. Regardless of whether you do or not, I hope you enjoy your time in the Free Republic."" Still the same expression as when we started.

3nxf3m,6,2015-10-07,"MS3s, thinking about the future much?",Therapist13,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/3nxf3m/ms3s_thinking_about_the_future_much/,"Wondering if any other MS3s are having a similar experience thus far...

so far, starting MS3 is like suddenly being thrown into the real world. MS1 and 2 seemed like a distant memory, lecture only a few hours a day, free time to do anything I wanted, yeah there were tests but they weren't too bad.

Now I'm actually living what work hours are going to be like in residency (i get off earlier than my residents too, so it's a huge underestimation of the real thing.) It's really gotten me thinking about things I never thought about before like work-life balance, having a good relationship with someone, specific career goals...on top of that I need to pick a specialty in several months! Ideally I'd pick one now so I could start looking for research opportunities in that field, but I've only had a limited exposure to rotations so far (only surgery and obgyn) and I've had a good enough time that I need to explore medicine to see what I really like. My guess is that I'll probably like medicine a lot too, which will make the choice even tougher.

Looking at my residents and how long they work and how tired they are, it honestly scares me. I went straight from undergrad to medical school and I don't know if I have the mental fortitude to make it through intern year alive. Maybe it's just cause i'm a brand new MS3 and still trying to get my bearings. I also don't know how I would date or find a relationship during residency and it's definitely putting some pressure on me to try a little harder now too.

Overall it's not that I'm having a bad time on third year, i'm actually learning quite a bit and my residents and attendings have in general been nice. It's just that it seems like there's a ton of stuff I need to decide on and I need to decide by next year too...

Any other MS3s or MS4s feeling similarly?"

It's been a good long time since I've been able to properly bathe, and I gotta say it did wonders for me. And, well...having things out in the open makes me feel a little better, too. Pearl has opened up a bit too, she really surprised me when she hugged me. 


Sticking around Albany seems like a good idea for a while. Pearl had met with Diablo, she was given an internship of sorts under him. Good for her, I'm glad she's getting what she wanted, we need a break. I offered my services as a mechanic, and Jessie can help me with it as well. She knows most of the stuff I do, she just hasn't gotten as much practice. 


The view over Albany was almost majestic, the ruined towers and government buildings created a beautiful vista, lit up by the sun. Looking down into the streets was another story, people slipping past each other in crowded dusty streets. I came to Albany on duty once, it was a beautiful city then, but now it lacks the same serenity. 


Boyce and Sandra had stayed the night as well, Boyce slept on the floor and let Sandra sleep on the couch. Once they woke up, Boyce and I talked for a bit. He and Sandra are going to catch a ride with a convoy out to where we left the Jeep. I didn't mention it, but we stopped off in Pennsylvania to pick up my truck. Propane here is stupid expensive, but I can find the parts to convert it back to gasoline. 


Pearl needs a weapon. And to be honest, Jessie needs a new knife, and she could probably do with her own gun, after seeing her handle my handgun at Cobbville, I trust her with her own. Ammo is plentiful here which it nice, because it makes it less expensive.


All in all this will be a good place to relax for a while. "

The company I work for is looking to take another IT intern, so I thought I'd post a link on here if anyone is interested. To be eligible the candidate must be studying a tertiary IT qualification as it can count towards points on their degree and allow for tax free pay. So far all the interns we've had have been offered fulltime employment after they have finished. If you have any queries don't hesitate to pm me and I'll try answer as best I can.

3ny0pf,6,2015-10-08,The flatline has been here since day 40 and it's still going strong + my long story,incognito_one,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/3ny0pf/the_flatline_has_been_here_since_day_40_and_its/,"I've been lurking here for the past few months. I stumbled upon NoFap back around July and my last day of PMO was on 8/2/15, so I'm 66 days in (despite not having a badge). I have an iPhone app with my own personal counter. I guess I felt like it was less of something I would have to ""log in and check"" compared to the badge.

Why am I writing this post? This is going to be a catharsis for me; it doesn't really matter to me if anyone reads it (although it would be appreciated). Regarding the title, I'm not really sure if I'm still flatlining or not. I'm sitting in a chair in my office thinking that I should be going to bed, but I want to share my story. Maybe I'm a little glum? Honestly, I watched some romantic comedy earlier, which probably wasn't the best idea. I can't promise there is a moral waiting at the end, so proceed with caution.

Here's the TL;DR. Before I lose you, I do have a question here. For the past 30 days or so (roughly since day 40), I've felt ""off"" a bit. I don't know whether it's depression or it's flatlining or both. Frankly, I see quite a few posts of people over 90 days and beyond that describe their confidence soaring. Is that coming back? More of an FYI, I'm 26 and have been PMOing since 13. Never got into violent P, but did go into erotic hypnosis.

*** After this, it gets pretty long. I'm writing this more for me than for anyone else ***

So you might be thinking, ""NoFap alone isn't enough...what else are you doing?"" Fair question. I think I'm doing ""enough."" I'm a little skeptical because this is my first time doing this. I don't have the perspective that multiple relapses might bring to recognize the different, and I don't want to sacrifice a streak just to gain the perspective either. I'm at the gym four times a week or so. I work 50 hours a week now. I try to eat healthy, which is largely due to me tracking what I eat. I use the Livestrong app on my iPhone. I don't have a big social circle of friends, but I do spend time with my family and see one of my best friends on the weekend. I'm very invested in my career right now, and I feel like I'm spending more time on the gym than any particular hobby. I'm taking cold showers. I don't make my bed. My house could be cleaner. Lately, I've felt lazy....but, I look at it favorably in that it could be worse.

I want to share some history here. There's a relationship involved down the road in this story that probably suffered because of fapping. Growing up, I was always a very quiet kid. I was not the most athletic. I played a lot of Halo and GTA in middle school and high school. My afternoons were spent in front of a TV. I started fapping when I was around 13. I remember humping my bed one day when I was around 11 and my mom walked in on me. That was before porn though. Not a lot happened after that until I got my first cell phone with Internet when I was 13. Obviously, that was a very different kind of Internet, but, hey, it worked, right? I would search Google images for whatever I could think up, wait the 20 seconds for some postage stamp-sized picture to load, and go to town. And I was learning. I didn't really know what to look for. We had shared one family computer that made the desktop a bit impractical. When I built my own computer, that opened up a whole new universe...well, the pictures got bigger at least. And I discovered erotic stories too. I read almost every other night, which meant fapping for hours. Some of it was a little educational, so I probably learned a thing or two ironically. I was a little chubby in high school. I had never gone on a date. My eyes would dart around. I would blush too easily. And I found myself agreeing with everybody. I had always blamed my parents for this because they would tell my brother and me not to speak at a table of adults until we were spoken to because that was ""being good."" On the one hand, maybe I took it too literally, or, equally likely, it was the PMO. When I was 15 or 16, I had almost written off women in the sense that they were unattainable and, therefore, I didn't need to try. I guess I look at it like a train where the conductor just didn't feel like stopping. In fact, he didn't even think to stop because he found out the train could go faster. Only he didn't really begin to speed up until college.

I went to a party school, but I didn't party. While everyone else was out drinking, I was playing video games and taking 30 minute showings just fapping away. Plus, the Internet was much faster. I had a 32 in LCD as a monitor, and I was in heaven. I didn't have a job either, so my life revolved around classes and sitting around playing games, eating pizza, and PMO. Now, luckily, I also cared a great deal about studying. I was near the top of my class in school, and it had always been ""easy"" to me...even the AP and accelerated classes. So, I was focusing on school at the same time.

I worked at a summer camp in the Midwest the summer after my freshmen year of school. I learned a great deal about responsibility that summer as I was a counselor. I also lost a lot of weight. I was actually active, and the camp fed the kids (and counselors) healthy food. I didn't realize the difference until I came back two months later. I noticed when I walked around campus that fall, girls would check me out. That had never happened before, or at least I never noticed. Rather than pursuing that new interest, I fell back into PMO (remember, women were unattainable). I also had a job that paid pretty well for college, but I worked nights (4-10 pm) some nights and had the 7 am - 3pm or 1 pm - 11 pm on the weekends. In my head, I rationalized, ""well, I work when everyone else is partying, so I guess I can't,"" and I would go home and PMO some more. 

I got an internship in the real estate field when I was still in school, which was a very lucky thing. That got me a job coming out of school, which then became a career. I graduated from school debt free with a solid career. So that was going very well in my life. But, aside from that, I didn't have a life. I wanted to impress my boss and our clients, and I put in a lot of hours. I would work until 10 or 11 on a Friday night and then be back at the office at least 6 hours a day on the weekends. That spun up to be 80 to 100 hours on average. I would never say ""no"" or tell him something could be done because, damn it, I would figure out a way. All because I wanted recognition and commissions. They came eventually, and I had a vain notion that, once I got a nice car, suddenly I would be noticed. My roommate had a few girlfriends over the years I lived with him, and he made it look effortless. What am I missing? I had signed up for the online dating in college, roughly when I started working. I went on some awkward first dates. I got catfished a few times. But they never really went on to second dates. I had been listening to erotic hypnosis at this point, and I used it more often than regular porn. I think I might still have some files laying around. That's the stuff that makes me want to relapse, not regular porn. It's powerful. If you have never done it, do not start. Don't even Google it out of curiosity. No good will come of it. People say the same thing about regular porn, but I wish I could take it back. Originally, I loved the idea about a handsfree O and wanted it pretty bad (because, hey, who needs sex if you can do it yourself with no hands). I'm still not convinced that it hasn't left some odd lasting impression on me.

After having worked for about three years, I had finally closed a big deal and got a fancy new car. I was ecstatic. I personally got a thrill out of driving it, but nothing else really changed. I didn't get a huge boost of confidence, and it wasn't like an Axe commercial! A few months later I got a gym membership in the spring of 2013; I went briefly. They sold me on the personal trainer thing (which should be illegal to do when you're high on endorphins), and the trainer wrecked me. I was peeing blood and could barely for a few days. I was into cycling too, which was a decent outlet. So, my life was sleep, PMO, work, PMO, sleep, ride on the weekends, and repeat. I joined eHarmony a few months later, and I met my first serious girlfriend ever that summer. That was a lot of firsts for me, including losing my virginity. If you're keeping score on the years here, that would make me 24 at the time. The problem that I didn't recognize at the time was that my mind was already fucked. I remember asking her to do things that were more like porn. I might have even asked her to ""act like she was in a porno"" at one point during sex. I can't imagine what was going through her mind when I said that. Having my head somewhat disillusioned that past 9 weeks has made me very embarrassed by some of these thoughts. What kind of person says that? We waited five months before having sex. We had both said we loved one another. I remember that sex was pretty decent for a while and then it slowed to a trickle. Once a week and then, eventually, once every few weeks. That only agitated and frustrated me more. While PMO had slowed down a little, once the sex disappeared, PMO came back in full force. That only caused more insecurities for her (""why do you need someone else when I'm right here?"" or ""I don't have a problem with porn, but when it affects your life, it's a problem""). When she said those things, I wrote them off. She didn't know what she's talking about. She's not a guy...how could she know. I asked her about past relationships and what those guys did differently because she said she had never had these problems before, although she was never strongly interested in sex regularly. That let jealousy sink in for me. There was one point about a year into the relationship where I realized I didn't have any feeling in my dick. I had to be in control or on top to finish. She would get uncomfortable and ask to stop. She would even try a BJ, but her jaw would get sore, but I usually had to do it myself...I was picky. Eventually, I came across the term ""death grip."" I thought that was the answer to all my problems. I stopped masturbating with my hands for a few weeks. The website I found said that the cure was to get a flashlight, use that once every two weeks, and then once every week until you're cured. Well, I was still using porn with the flashlight. So, some feeling did return, but I was still seeing all my favorite scenes when we had sex. I'm sure she could sense that.

She had moved into my house after only 10 months of dating. Too soon? I had no idea. I questioned it at the time, but I wanted it. I felt like I loved her. I became a bit of a pest when she would have sex. I didn't realize it though. I felt like it was at first. I bought an Aneros prostate massager. In my head, I like the idea of being pegged. I have no idea if I really wanted that or if it was just the porn. But, the massager seemed interesting, and, if it worked, I would also get to feel good without having to get rejected by her for sex. Sex, to me, was the most important part of the relationship. I did care about her too (and that's not really a slip here...I didn't feel like I loved her anymore, but I ""cared"" for her), but sex was the driver in my mind. She wanted to get a dog and to buy furniture together. I made up excuses about why we couldn't get a dog, and I bought a few thousand dollars' worth of furniture, including a new bed, rather than split it with her, just so we wouldn't have to divvy things up in case we broke up. The exit strategy was already in my head. I hadn't told her this. A month or two later, we were going for a walk and she asked why I never spoke about our future. I said something stupid like, ""I'm not thinking that far ahead,"" which ultimately became a full blown debate about what marriage is and how I see commitment. She wanted me to want to get married. I told her that I bought the first car I test drove because I knew I really wanted it, and I just didn't know the same to be true about her. I thought about it for a day or two and told her she had thrown a pebble into a pond, and the ripples kept growing. And I couldn't go back, and that it wasn't fair for me to be in a relationship with her when I couldn't reciprocate her feelings. So we ended it. It took a little while for her to disappear from my life (she lived with me after we broke up for a month...I figured I was a nice guy, but I didn't want to rock the boat and I put her ahead of me even still). 

I was regularly going to the gym again, and I had been eating healthier for some time. I wanted to get in better shape to be ""marketable."" I lost 15 pounds and have only recently begun gaining some muscle (not much yet). It is now six months after breaking up, but I never shed a single tear. Does that make me a bad person?

So now I find myself reading Models, No More Mr. Nice Guy, How to Win Friends and Influence People, and discovering what I've been doing wrong all my life. What I've learned is that NoFap is worth it. I feel more sure about myself in my personal life in these last 9 weeks than before. I made the distinction from work life because that's where I dominate. But my social life struggles. I don't have a lot of friends. I still build computers. I tinker with home automation. I go to the gym and I cycle. I got a gun recently and I want to shoot a bow and arrow. I want to have more hobbies, take some cooking classes, and meet people. I work with people old enough to be my parents, and I feel disconnected from people my own age (with some exceptions). I'm arrogant when it comes to my intelligence and modest in most other areas of my life. I'm still trying not to focus on women too much. I am telling myself that I'm doing NoFap to become a better and stronger version of myself. But, there's also a quiet voice that says, ""yeah, and for a girlfriend too."" Is that wrong? I am telling myself a bullshit line to make myself feel better? I don't know. Back to the start of this novel, am I only feeling this way because of the flatline or depression? Days 7 to 30 were fantastic! How do I do that again?! The only thing I can do is keep going. And I will. I believe right now that the rest of this will be easy. That alone tells me more change is coming. That urges will come back and that this must be a flatline.

I did not intend to write this much, but thank you if you did read all the way through. People in my life know bits and pieces of this story (and, obviously, this isn't all of it), but no one can every truly know someone else. All we get of others are the snippets, the little conversations, and the shared moments that make up life. But I have never shared this with anyone. So, to that end, it does feel very good to put a more complete - but still incomplete - version of my life, including my own biases, out on paper for no one or many to read.

I hardly feel a part of this community because I have never commented or posted until now. But I also feel very much a part of this community because of the way everyone communicates and shares their stories here. My hope is that I can contribute to that in some small way. So, above all, thank you to everyone else. Keep sharing and keep going!"
3nyv3y,12,2015-10-08,Decided to finally divorce my wife after uncovering insane amount of lies and infidelity (x-post /r/Relationships),bubba_abobo,Divorce,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/3nyv3y/decided_to_finally_divorce_my_wife_after/,"Posted this on /r/Relationships yesterday. Post got locked for some reason, but before that someone suggested posting here. Hoping to get some more specific advice other than ""Get a lawyer"", specifically because I said I don't have a lot of money to spare. I now understand I DO need a lawyer, but the HOW of affording one is one of things I'm looking to find out from this group. I also realize I (and she) will need therapy, but as individuals (her for mental health reasons, I for trust issues, kids for coping). I'm not sold on the idea of a DNA test. Extremely long read, but it's also an extremely fucked up situation. TIA...

I've decided to finally divorce my wife...it's hard to say those words. But I know this is my only option at this point. I'll try to layout the situation here and then wait patiently for your advice on how best to proceed. This is not a decision I've come to lightly, it's been building for many years.

Basically, my wife has lied to me about everything from the moment I met her. When I say everything, I do mean everything. About who she is, events that have happened in her life, her infidelities, and her commitment to change. I've confronted her about some of these things before and even then, when I've had her at her most vulnerable and she confessed some of her lies to me and told me the ""truth"", I've since found out that they were just more lies. I'm not a psychologist by any means, but I am pretty certain she has [Histrionic Personality Disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histrionic_personality_disorder) mixed with a good helping of pathlogical lying. She seems to match every symptom listed. The tale I'm about to tell here contains some sexual language, so if you're not comfortable with that just be forewarned.

When I first met her, I was getting out of a long term relationship so I admittedly was just looking for a quick hookup. This was before Tinder and I didn't know about Craigslist personals section, so I turned to AdultFriendFinder. I was a cheapskate and didn't want to pay for the service, so I searched around a bit using her AFF handle and eventually found her IM name. I sent her a message and we began chatting. A few weeks later we decided to meet for lunch. Lunch was a success and followed that up with dinner, and a few more dates, etc. etc. She'd call me over in the morning for sex before work and we were hitting it off pretty well. She told me she lived with a male roommate so she'd wait to call me until he left so we could be alone. I never met the guy, but I didn't care. I had no reason to and in my naivete just let it slide. She did mention she was previously married and when that marriage ended (because he cheated on her repeatedly) she needed a place to stay and couldn't afford to live on her own, so hence the roommate.

One night not long into our relationship I was out getting dinner with some co-workers while we were working on an overnight project, I got a call from her in hysterics. She called me seemingly inconsolable. She said she found out that the man who raised her (we'll call him Italian dad) was not her real father. He was a man her mother had been dating while her real father was in prison. When her father got out of prison he was introduced to her (as a child) as her uncle. Real dad stayed out of the picture while Italian dad played the role of father figure. Italian dad got angry at mom and the whole situation and couldn't handle it anymore and let it slip that he was not her real father, etc. etc. and that Uncle Dad was her real dad. I had not met any of her family at this point, even though she'd met all of mine and most of my extended family as well. Sidenote: I call him Italian dad because she said she spent summers in Italy with Italian Dad's parents (who lived in Italy) when she was old enough to travel as an unaccompanied minor through her high school years. I'll revisit this one later.

I was impressed with this woman. She had a bachelor's degree from the same university I went to (though from a different campus) and then went on to get her master's from Columbia in NYC. She worked in her field for a few years before getting burned out and just fell back to working in retail because it was so much less stressful. She loved me and I loved her. She decided she would go on the pill because sex without a condom is so much better for both of us. And then....she's pregnant.

I am nothing if not loyal and honorable. What I didn't tell her was that I had already mentally decided I would ask her to marry me, but I wanted it to be romantic and so was going to wait for the perfect time to ask. But as her pregnancy hormones raged a few months into the pregnancy she was sobbing uncontrollably and convinced I was going to leave her. After learning of the drama with her dad I could certainly understand her feelings of being alone or abandoned. Add to that her Catholic guilt of being an unmarried single mother and she broke down. And so to rescue her, I decided I couldn't wait any longer. I had to calm her, and so I asked her to marry me that night she had this breakdown. I didn't have a ring, we were in our living room, she was sobbing out of her mind, and I felt bad for her. No romance there. Oh well....

Our son was born and we were getting our new life established. It was a hectic time as any new parent can attest, but we still made time for each other whenever we could manage. Throughout the early days of our relationship she was active in an online chat system that was predominantly sex oriented. She explained that she'd been part of that community for so long and had made some really good friends through there. I could understand that sense of belonging, as I had my own online ""community"" I was a part of, although not sex chat related. I had no reason to distrust her and told her that was fine. I even helped her make some sexy avatars to go along with the site's theme. She was really into sex and that really turned me on, so I wasn't complaining.

But then...things started to cross boundaries. I wanted to keep my wife happy, so I stayed quiet and just pretended I didn't notice certain things. One of the first of these incidences happened a few months after our son was born. I came home from work and found her masturbating in our bedroom. My first thought was, ""Wow, this is hot. Time to get it on."" As I stepped into the room I could see her slyly put away her phone and as she's doing so I hear a male voice on the other end. She was having phone sex with some guy. Ok, play it cool, she's amped up and ready, just ignore it, so I did. But I couldn't forget it. Over the next several years (including the present) there would be several more instances of strange phone calls I overheard when she thought no one was listening. She would tell these guys fantastical made up stories, inventing elaborate alternate lives for herself and her family. One conversation in particular I heard her having through a closed door was telling how she was a widow and that she was spending some time with her family at their ski cottage in the mountains to just get away from everything for awhile after the stress of burying her husband. And this was normal for her! Every time (and there have been many times!) she has an entire alternate persona that she keeps up with these men. Sometimes using real names, sometimes made up. Sometimes using partially true information for her story, but typically completely made up. I have no idea how she can keep these dozens of plot lines straight from one day to the next and often with multiple people at once; it's mind boggling!

I realize I'm getting a bit long-winded here, but I wanted to establish how fucked up she is. I'll skip ahead to some of the more recent and more aggregious violations of our marriage. So three years ago I was away for the weekend, but not terribly far away, visiting friends. Typically when I do this (a couple times a year) I just stay overnight there because they are generally very late nights and I'm too tired to drive. But this night I had a nagging feeling that she was up to no good; by the way she was acting and texting me, offering up details for things I hadn't asked about, being overly verbose about everything going on with her night. She's not like that with me normally, so something was off. It was 1:30 or 2:00AM and I decided I needed to go home that night. It was only about an hour's drive, but I'd get some coffee and be fine. One of the details she offered up was that one of her friends (who I'll call Jane) had come over that night and she had brought some pot with her that they were going to smoke (I've never done any drugs ever and am vehemently opposed to taking anything illegal and she knows this). She texted again later and let me know that Jane would be staying the night because she was in no condition to drive. So I get home around 3:00AM and there's no other car in the driveway. I look around and there are no cars parked on the street near our house either. Where's Jane's car? So I go inside quietly just in case I didn't see the car or my wife picked up Jane earlier in the evening, expecting to find Jane asleep on the couch. What I found on the couch instead is what appeared to be a dried semen stain and a very loud snoring sound coming from upstairs in the bedroom. I quietly made my way upstairs to our bedroom and confirmed my hunch that drove me to come home that evening. Lying there in my bed next to my wife was a strange man that I'd never seen before. I was in complete shock and felt like my world was ending. I went across the hall to my daughter's bedroom (we have a daughter at this point as well, but both kids were spending the weekend at my in-law's, another red flag since I was away that weekend, why also unload the kids on them when they don't exactly live nearby?) and just sit there with my head in my hands for what must have been at least 30 minutes or more contemplating what to do next. For as calm as my initial response was, I decided I couldn't be calm any longer. I went in the bedroom, flipped the light on, and punched the guy in the head as hard as I could. In fact I punched so hard my wedding ring flew off of my other hand (a sign perhaps?). I grabbed him by the legs and pulled him out of my bed telling him to get the fuck out of my house. I'll skip some of the details here, but looking back on it, I don't think he knew she was married. He seemed generally surprised that I was there. To top it off, he didn't drive there (hence the lack of another car) and so I had to reluctantly allow my wife to drive him home. I wasn't thinking clearly at that point or I'd have made him walk home or get a cab. When she returned home we sat in the kitchen and talked until the sun came up. She swore up and down that nothing happened and they just got high and fell asleep. The thing was I didn't catch them in the act, I couldn't prove anything. Magically the stain on the couch disappeared after I finally fell asleep later that day, a picture of us on our honeymoon that I pointed out was missing from our refrigerator re-appeared.

I had many doubts about her, even before this, of details of her life that I just never brought up because I felt they weren't important or worth starting a fight over. But at this point, I had to ask her flat out just to see if she'd tell me the truth. One insignificant thing was the high school she attended. She's always claimed to have gone to a certain Catholic school in her town but I couldn't find any evidence of this, and actually believed she went to the public school district she would have lived in (one of the worst districts in the state). I didn't care what school she went to, I just wanted to know the truth. She maintained that she went to the Catholic school. Ok, whatever, that isn't really important. What I really wanted to get some truth to was her roommate when we met. Over the years I picked up little tidbits about the roommate that never added up. Things that coincided too much with details of her ex-husband. I said, ""I don't think [roommate] is a real person. I think [roommate] is actually [ex-husband] and you were married when I met you. I think I was the other man that ended your marriage!"" Denial. She had a story for this too...some of the details changed slightly, others elaborated on, but she had the bases covered and I had no proof other than a hunch. Eventually, I forgave her and told myself I needed to trust her again for our relationship to survive and for the sake of our kids, so with our foundation shaken but not broken, we moved on.

About six-eight months later is when I heard her conversation/phone call with the guy claiming to spend time with her family in the imaginary ski cottage, etc. (she's never skied in her life, her family is poor, there is no ski cottage). When she hung up that call I was standing outside our closed bedroom door where she was taking it and told her to go back inside. I warned her that I heard everything she was saying and I wanted it to stop. She at first denied that the call ever took place. I mentioned specific details of the call and then she knew she'd been caught. Always a lie with her, that's her first and only self-defense mechanism. Another six-eight months go by (this day happens to be my birthday) and I'm working from home. She's also off that day for some reason so we're both at home and she's been feverishly texting all day with yet another guy. How do I discover this one? She handed me her phone. Yep, she's also not very good at hiding her tracks. We've had separate cell phone accounts for awhile and we finally decided to combine them onto one service. My carrier was the better deal, so she would port her number to my account. While we're both home we decide it's a good time to do the port since her phone would be out of commission while we wait for the port to complete over to her new phone. She hands me her old phone, I do a backup of it so she can maintain contacts, pictures, etc. While I have the phone in my hands I receive a few txts from a number I don't recognize and it's not saved in her contacts either. The port is taking a few hours (as it always does when switching carriers) and she's growing increasingly impatient (obvi she didn't want to stop chatting with this new guy). Port eventually completes and all of the queued text messages come pouring in. She takes her phone and starts repsonding....hundreds and hundreds of them in a single day. On my plan (that she's now a part of) there is no unlimited texting, you pay for each message. I check our account usage the next day and I see the hundreds of messages and ask her about them. I tell her to knock it off, it's costing us a hell of a lot more money than it should. Eventually find out it's yet another guy, I can't remember the resolution because frankly, it's happened so many times they all blur together at this point. Confront her about it yet again, she promises to stop...again.

Three more months go by and now I'm in full paranoia mode. I check her phone whenever I'm able to, reading e-mails, texts, looking at pictures she's taken...find a few nudes that she sure as hell never sent to me. Long story short (haha, yeah right) she ends up meeting a guy for lunch and then they later go to a nearby park. A message sent after their lunch date has her wishing there weren't so many people around in the park so they could have done more. That's it! I've had it! She calls me for something later and I can't hide the fact that I'm pissed with her. I leave my office so I can talk in private and I let her have it. I know what she's been up to, I know about the lunch date, the park, everything. Flirting with someone through texts/e-mails/phone calls is one thing, but it's entirely different when you're going on dates with these guys. She breaks down crying, fearful that our marriage is over. I relent...yet again (I said I was loyal), but warn her that there will be no more chances. This is it.

That last chance took approximately eight months (at least until I caught her, maybe sooner) but that nearly brings us to present time. Did you know you could message people through Yelp? She did apparently, and was chatting up some local guy through that. That's where I found her first most recent round of shenanigans. From there she moved onto using Kik Messenger. She posted on Reddit looking for Kik Pals, and it didn't take long for her to snare a few. I haven't been able to closely follow her activities on Kik but I know she's been in regular communication with at least two and their messages are not exactly ""just friends"". Again, the other day she needed me to do some things with her phone because of problems she's been having and I quickly found a folder containing all pictures and videos she's sent through Kik...extremely explicit material. But this discovery was *after* I decided to divorce her.

You see...ever since that night I came home early and found her in bed with another man, I've never been able to truly forgive her. It's always been there eating away at me. No matter what I tell myself, that I can trust her, that I need to trust her, that she really does love me...I know she would always fall back to lying and mistrust. The last several weeks for no specific reason (other than the culmination of the years of lies), I finally decided I couldn't take it any longer. I debated back and forth on whether this was the right thing to do and then, I pressed Send...I wrote a ""letter"" that I sent to her ex-husband via Facebook messenger. I had no idea if he'd even see it, let alone respond. But I had questions that I needed answers to before I made my divorce decision and he had nothing to gain or lose by being honest with me. Within 30 seconds, I got the ""Seen"" notice. Another minute or two go by and he reponds, ""Well I am sure she has lied to you about me and my past too. Let me just say that right from the top."" Holy shit, this is happening. We proceeded to chat for the next hour and a half about everything. He even wants to meet me in person so we can talk more. We have a quid pro quo conversation about everything I've ever wondered about her and things he's wondered about me.

To summarize:

1. I was the other man! They were still married and living together when I met her.
2. The roommate is a complete fabrication. I did a public records search on Spokeo and did find someone with the same name as [Roommate] who lived on the same street as one of my wife's old addresses, but [ex-husband] didn't know who he was so, weird coincidence or neighbor that he didn't know?
3. She knew who her father was all along. Italian dad was completely made up. Those summer trips to Italy? Never happened. She visited there once on a school trip, that's it.
4. Speaking of school, yes, she went to the public shool I had suspected for quite some time. She's not even a Catholic! Where'd she go during that period she claimed to be going to Sunday mass? Probably on more dates with random dudes! Oh and the two degrees she claimed to have? After catching her with lunch date dude, I demanded to know truths to the lies she's been telling me. One that she offered up willingly was that she had no degrees. She said she attended both schools, but never finihsed either one. [Ex-husband] informed me that she never even attended either of those schools, just one semester at a local college and that's it. So even when ""confessing"" some truth to me, she just told me different lies!
5. She's pulled this same shit with [ex-husband] repeatedly! 
6. Ran up his credit cards and left them unpaid (relatedly, basically drained my 401(k) through loans and early withdrawals she talked me into doing)
7. Do I need to keep going on!? Everything is a lie! All of it I've said here and I've only begun to scratch the surface! There's more, but I don't have time in my life to go over the dozens and dozens of transgressions. Well, maybe one more. One story she's told countless times is that she lived in New York City during 9/11 (you know, while *not* attending Columbia). She told of how the attack happened while she was in class and the fear and panic everyone in class experienced as it happened. About how she knew a few people working at the WTC as interns for various companies and that some of them never made it out alive. To go along with this, she's told me a few times that she worked as an intern at the New York Times and the day after the attack she got a shared byline on one of the front page stories that ran on the 12th, even going so far as to once say that story was nominated for a Pulitzer prize. All of it lies...[ex-husband] informed me that they never lived in NYC. They visited a few times for some fun weekends, but never lived there. That is insulting to every New Yorker who DID experience the tragedies of 9/11 and it makes me sick.

So, I'm going to divorce my wife. There will be no trial seperation, I've already given her enough opportunity to change to no effect. There will be no counseling, I've had all I can take. I can never trust her again. I wish it didn't have to be this way for the kids' sake, but it has to be this way. I know that in the long run this is the right thing to do, but I'm frankly scared to death of the storm that's brewing and what hell we will all have to go through in the interim. I love my kids more than anything in this world and I want nothing but the best for both of them.

So now I've concluded my tale of woe and I come to my next chapter. Where do I go from here? How can I make this process proceed as best as possible? I don't have a lot of money, we've always lived week to week. If we can do this without involving lawyers that would be best I think...neither one of us could afford one anyway. Will she try to screw me over with the kids? I don't know. This is the uncertainty I'm facing and I don't like it. As weird as it may sound, I don't want anything bad to happen to her either. I have every right to wish her ill will, but I don't want to fight with her after this is all done. I need us to have a mature parenting only relationship after I tell her I want to divorce her and I need her to work with me to make as smooth a transition as possible.

Some hitches in this: Neither one of us has any family very close by. They're not too far away, but far enough that neither one of us could conceivably stay with them if needed. She is a work-at-home employee for her company and she's going to need to address that situation; I don't want her to be fired because she has no place to work from. Because she is a work-from-home employee, she's currently able to get our kids to and from school as needed. Any change in our living arrangement needs to take that into account.

I have been advised from a close friend who went through a divorce last year to wait until after the holidays just for emotional support reasons. Holidays alone really suck.... Plus this will give me some time to get things planned for (I hope).

So I ask everyone for your advice on what to do from here, any resources that could help guide me through this, and anything I can do to help my kids cope. I was 19 when my parents split so I could handle things as an adult. My brother was only 13 though and he really declined after. My kids are 5 and 8...I'm scared of how this is going to affect them more than anything.

Help me....please.

P.S. Before anyone asks, yes, she had an Ashely Madison account but I didn't need their big data breach to tell me that. I found that out during the debacle on my birthday. Just one of the e-mails I saw while I had the phone.

**tl;dr**: I've been lied to from the very beginning of my relationship about literally everything and been cheated on repeatedly over the course of 9 years. I've decided to divorce my wife but have no idea how to proceed with little to no money to spare for a lawyer. What should I do?"
3nyvw4,10,2015-10-08,"I [28 M] got suspicious and looked at my girlfriend's [26 F] Facebook, found illicit messages",throwaway9086117,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3nyvw4/i_28_m_got_suspicious_and_looked_at_my/,"To start, she and I have a complicated relationship already. We've been friends for a few years, and when we finally started dating in February, I was going through a divorce (I was separated at the time). The divorce wasn't finalized until July but it was pretty open that I had moved out already. 

(side note, our mutual friends have no issues with our relationship, so it's not like there's a cloud or stigma of ""but they got together when he was married!"")

In May she went on a 3-month long internship in another state. We talked every day, said our ""I love yous"" before hanging up, etc. That said there was still this sort of ""we'll see where we are in the fall"" thing because technically my divorce wasn't done until July. We couldn't be out in the open about our relationship as much as we'd like until that was all over with. But there was never any ""let's take a break for the summer"" talk.

Flash-forward to September. Several of us are hanging out at a bar, and one of her exes is there. Not a huge deal. But he mentions that he had stayed with her for a weekend in August while she was in the other state.

I brought this up to her and she said he was just flying out of that city so they decided to hang out, no big deal. Plus he knows she's in a relationship, and he is also dating someone.

All the same, it nags at me. For whatever reason, this week in particular, it's been driving me crazy. She's out of town this week (for work) and so I did something dumb and decided to poke through her Facebook messages.

Most of the stuff with the above Ex is innocuous, but back in June, they had a couple conversations which quickly devolved into sexting (and apparently snap chatting each other). Stuff like ""I wish you were here right now,"" talking about trying to arrange three-ways when she returns, etc. Even when I wanted to justify this as ""well she was admittedly drunk,"" the *next day* she states that ""sober her"" is still down if he is. He asks for nudes and she says ""I think I can arrange that.""

So......there's really no other way to spin this.

I've talked to two friends of mine who are aware of the extent of her and my relationship (that it goes back to February, not ""after July"" like we are kind of playing it up). One of them said I should confront her, the other says ""well it was four months ago and you still weren't divorced."" Meaning she wasn't really in any obligation to stay faithful.

I'm torn. Thing is, I've been under the impression that this has been a monogamous relationship. As I said, we spoke every day, there was never any notion of ""let's put this on hold until after July."" Plus now I'm assuming she and her ex hooked up in August.

Should I bring this up? If so, how can I possibly do so in a way that doesn't make me a hypocrite? I can't exactly preach trust/faithfulness while rifling through her FB messages.

It's driving me crazy and I don't know what to do. I could let it slide--it was *four months* ago, we weren't officially in a relationship I guess--but I can't trust her.

Any advice is welcome.

( **Timeline:** In case it was hard to follow:

- February: start dating but under the table since I'm only ""separated"" from my wife

- May: girlfriend leaves on an internship

- June: sends illicit messages to an ex, talks about wanting to sleep with him

- July: divorce finalized

- August: ex stays with her

- October/present: read these messages)
   
**tl;dr**: Started dating a girl while I was separated from my wife, divorce goes final in the summer. Facebook messages indicate she was sexting/snap chatting/probably sleeping with another guy over the summer while she was away. Not sure if I should call her on this or let it slide since I was still technically married."

I have no goals nor aspirations, no passions. If money weren't an obstacle I'd just stay in all day every day and watch tv shows.
  
I go to college and am studying to be an IT administrator, haven't failed any classes yet, but haven't excelled in anything either. There's a required internship which I need to do to get my degree but I can't find any place that will take me, so I'm feeling rather apathetic about the current classes I have because why the hell bother if I can't finish school anyway without the internship.
  
I've been depressed for the past five years or so with some days being harder and others easier to manage, but for the past year or so I've been having suicidal thoughts every other day or so. Nothing really planned out or anything but more like random thoughts throughout the day like ""hey, I could climb this tree and the height of that sturdy branch should have enough drop-room to snap my neck with a rope."" or ""Oh, that's one of the express trains going to another city, if I jumped in front of it right now then I'd probably die.""
  
I haven't had these kinds of thoughts since about four years ago, and they led up to a suicide attempt. And I even fucked that up."
3nzrl8,1,2015-10-08,Just applied for Entry Level Technology Engineer online.,UNDF,accenture,https://www.reddit.com/r/accenture/comments/3nzrl8/just_applied_for_entry_level_technology_engineer/,"Hi guys. So there was a networking event at my university yesterday and I went to talk to the recruiter. Accenture was the only company I wanted to talk to out of the 10+ companies there. Later that night I went back and applied through their careers site. This is for an entry level technology engineer. I want to do stuff more on the lines of security and consulting but I am willing to code and program. The only thing is I do not have any prior internships. 

Fast forward to today, I got an email for a 3 phase interview process: 
Phase 1: Introduce Yourself! On-demand survey. Within 24 hours you will receive an email with the subject “Interview with Accenture”. The email will contain a link to an on-demand survey.Please complete the survey within 2 business days of receiving the link. You may take the survey at any time of day and from any location. The primary purpose of this survey is to get to know you better so that we may tailor your interview experience based on your personal strengths and abilities.

Important Phase 1 Tips  – the survey includes one question that requires a video response. The question is “why do you want to work at Accenture?” Note, you will be able to see yourself on your screen while answering the question. That can be awkward for some people so you may want to practice in the mirror prior to taking the survey. You will have two chances to record your response.

o    Please be sure to look at the camera, not at yourself

o    Casual attire is perfectly fine

o    Remember to put your best foot forward!

·         Phase 2: On-Demand Technical Challenge - Qualifying applicants are encouraged (not required) to participate in one of three technical challenges of escalating difficulty. The recruiter will recommend a challenge level based on the applicant’s Phase 1 survey responses. This is a great opportunity for applicants to show off their technical abilities and for us to get a better sense of what role you may be best suited for. Note – applicants will not be disqualified from the interview process based on Phase 2 results. More information will be provided about Phase 2 after Phase 1 is complete.
 
·         Phase 3: On-Campus Interviews –  Qualifying applicants will be invited to participate in two on-campus interviews with Accenture leaders. Each interview will run approximately 45 min. and will be scheduled back-to-back. Applicants should arrive no later than 15 mins before their scheduled interview time. On-campus Interviews for the AFS Technology Engineer position are scheduled for October 16th. Additional details will be provided regarding on-campus interviews for this position following the completion of Phase 2.

Basically I just need some tips and pointers for the process. What should I do/shouldn't do. I just want to know how I should go about it for these interviews. Any help is appreciated because I truly want to work this company. Thank you so much for the help. "
3o0r54,3,2015-10-08,What do you return in services?,php_questions,PHPhelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/PHPhelp/comments/3o0r54/what_do_you_return_in_services/,"For example you have a login service that takes a username and password, then you search if the username exists, then check if the password matches

But what do you return if there is an error? Do you just always return false, and if everything is successful, return true?

What if you want more info about the error?

Currently, i return something like ""return Status::make(Status::FAIL, Status::BAD_VALUE, Status::USERNAME);

And then i can use $status = Status::getLast() to get the last status object and i can get properties like the status code or error type/field to basically get more information about the error.

But that also means i would need to use a bunch of static calls to
the Status class, which seems horrible..

So how do you handle ""intern"" communication inside of your application?

I'm 30, married, two kids, and half way through my MSW program. My first job out of my BSW program was a case manager at a mental health facility. Worked there 1.5 years. It wasn't hard, but mental health is not my passion; foster care is. With that being said, I grew up in ""the system"" myself. Spent ages 8-18 with DHR (you all my call is different things where you live). I've ALWAYS said, ""I will NEVER work for DHR because basically, they suck, meaning... Over worked and high rate of turnover, etc."" With that being said, I accepted an offer with DHR 6 months ago; what the hell?! I figured I'd give it a try. SOOOO, tomorrow, will be my last day at DHR. I was there almost 6 months. I'm quitting because I didn't get the proper support I needed to maintain my sanity to be an effective worker in the foster care unit. In other words, my supervisor sucked really REALLY bad. I didn't get help with ISP's, P/O, Medicaid stuff, nothing. Our system we use is not the best the state could have created. The head director knows my heart. I cried the ugly cry twice last week in front of her because I'm so torn. Okay, not that I'm torn, I feel badly for only being there a short amount of time and now I want to leave. She wants me to stay. She has begged and begged me to stay, which makes me feel even more bad. The other part of me says it's okay. Everything will be okay. I'm about to start my internships (I have to do 3 different places each semester), so that will take up my time. Financially, yeah, it will be hard with only one income, but I know how to be frugal. I guess I'm really worried about what to say when I go for another job and they ask why I was only there for 6 months, but then I really just want to say, ""I SURVIVED 6 WHOLE MONTHS!"" haha. DHR just wasn't the right fit. That's okay, right!?!?!?!"

I recently did the 2 45-min back to back phone screen interviews, and I just got an email from my recruiter that there will be another 45-min technical phone screen interview. Is this normal? Should I be worried that I was given a third interview, while ""most"" internship interview processes are just 2 technical interviews?

3o1evh,6,2015-10-08,Junior Year in Supply Chain and I have so many questions??,thedamianvincent,supplychain,https://www.reddit.com/r/supplychain/comments/3o1evh/junior_year_in_supply_chain_and_i_have_so_many/,I should graduate December 2016 so I'm trying to put myself in the best place to get a job around that time. Right now I'm finalizing a resume to acquire a summer and possibly a fall internship. I have a 2.93 because I was previously in a science heavy major. This Spring I will be starting most of my electives which includes SCM using SAP and Excel and lean six sigma. I guess my question is what should I be working on to better my chances of getting a decent job in my field? Thanks.
3o1vh4,6,2015-10-08,"CMV: The American dream is live and well, and any person can be successful through hard work.",doug_seahawks,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3o1vh4/cmv_the_american_dream_is_live_and_well_and_any/,"I believe the American dream is still absolutely alive, and that anyone who works hard can become successful, no matter where in society they come from, as long as they plan ahead and are willing to work hard. 

Today, due to the internet and the rise of technology, literally anyone with access to a computer can become a billionaire through a savvy startup. However, if computers aren't your thing, you can still use the internet to almost guarantee yourself a good future. For example, review courses for the SAT are available online on places like Khan academy. That means anyone, regardless or socioeconomic status, can spend some time online, do well on their standardized tests, and go to a great college. Due to things like affirmative action, it's actually easier to be admitted to a top college if you are poor, a minority, or the first in your family to go to college, and their are many scholarships available for all those demographics. Especially if you have good test scores and a good GPA, you can be admitted to a top school, get financial aid, a scholarship, and student loans, and attend. 

Now, I know student loans are a burden, but if you go to a top 50 school and work hard, you'll have no trouble paying them off. Again, in college, just work hard and get good grades, choose a relevant major, and you'll do fine. It helps to get a summer internship (many of which pay pretty well) in your desired field, but it's not required. 

Now, after college, you have two choices. Either choose a career and dive in, or choose a career that requires more advanced schooling. If you want to be a doctor or business professional, just work for 2-3 years and then go the required school. Sure, you'll take on debt, but the work beforehand will give you a building block and it'll pay off in the long run.

Now, you're done with business or med school, and you can easily land a job that pays over 100k. Work that for a few years, you'll get some raises and likely be making 200k+ by now, so just pay off your loans and don't spend too much. By around the age of 30, you'll have climbed the ranks significantly if you work hard, and you can easily be a member of the upper class, earning 500k+.

I honestly don't see how nearly anyone can complete the above pathway if they really want to. At no point does being disadvantaged growing up actually hurt you, because loans are so easy to get, so, besides a little bit of interest, you can still get to where you want to go. 

Every time people talk about a lack of social mobility, I just think they are lazy or don't know enough about the economy to follow a proper path, and I feel a little guilty about my opinion, but I just can't figure out how it isn't possible. I'm specifically referring to the USA here too. Lastly, I'm someone who is young and had a privileged upbringing, so sorry if I see this from a warped perspective, but its just my 2 cents. CMV

I know things are supposed to be rough the first few months, but it's already October and I still feel like a total newbie.  My presentations are bad.  I forget things.  My base of knowledge is terrible.

Recently it's been particularly bad because I'm on a busy ICU rotation and Im totally overwhelmed.  I've been ""lucky"" enough to have relatively low-volume rotations over the past few months so it's a big change having to put my medicine hat on again and think ICU.  To make things worse our census has been really high and we are almost constantly capped.  I'm struggling to even keep up with the basics of what's going on with the patients and I'm making boneheaded mistakes all the time.  I get to the hospital early and stay late.  I'm not shirking, I just can't keep up with what's going on. 

Today the icing on the cake is that I made an especially stupid mistake that ended up hurting a patient and I just can't get over it.  I feel awful.  I think I'm too dumb to be a doctor and I'm questioning my career choice, not because I don't like EM but because I don't think I'm smart enough to be a good EM doc.

I am struggling with procedures as well.  I didn't get to do many as a medical student and I'm pretty terrible.  I am terrified that I am going to hurt someone badly.

One caveat, I had my quarterly evaluation recently and the program assistant director said that so far they have no concerns about my performance so I'm not doing anything obviously bad enough that they think I wont finish the program.  I'm not worried about not graduating at this point, I'm just worried I'm going to be an awful doctor when I do.

I don't know what to do.  I feel so incompetent all the time and I'm scared I'm going to hurt more people.  I read when I can but I don't know how to get better?  Help?"

My message to Jolla is this: Where you let us down is the following: You sold the idea of being open yet failed to do that. In fact you are selling a Chinese tablet as if it was your own. You've then botched the user expectations and made stupid blunders such as being able to write down your address correctly or having fundamental last minute changes.

*The Martian* continued Hollywood's streak of striking rich with space-set dramas released in the fall, as it easily opened #1 with $54M - just a hair short of 2013's $55.7M record set by another stranded-in-space tale, *Gravity*. With fantastic reviews and no competition this weekend, *The Martian* should bypass *The Bourne Ultimatum*'s $227M to become Matt Damon's highest grossing movie ever. One of the best reviewed movies of the year, *Sicario*, expanded wide to over 2,500 theaters and did better than expected with $12M over the weekend. It shouldn't have any problem ending its run around $40M and will factor big into this year's Oscar race. *Hotel Transylvania 2* continues to dominate the family market, only dropping 31% for a fantastic $33M second weekend.


This week's wide releases...

http://cdn2-www.comingsoon.net/assets/uploads/2015/04/panheader.jpg

**Pan (WB)** - Warner Brothers looks to cash in on the live-action remakes of classic animated fairy tales with their 2nd attempt in 3 years, as *Pan* sky-floats its way into over 3,400 theaters. This version of *Pan* doesn't aim to stray too far from the classic tale, as it follows Peter Pan (played by unknown Levi Miller) who finds himself in Neverland to fight Blackbeard (Hugh Jackman) to save the world and Tinkerbell - or something like that, I don't know shit about Peter Pan. Pushed into production not because WB had figured out a new spin on a timeless tale, but because WB saw a box office trend and decided to limp their way into the fray (again). Also showing up is Garrett Hedlund as Hook, Rooney Mara as (the traditionally Native American) Tiger Lily, and although they haven't been even hinted at in the marketing plan, apparently Amanda Seyfried and Cara Delevinge also are in this movie.

As noted before, this is indeed WB's 2nd try to break into that sweet live-action fairy tale money - following their bomb two years *Jack The Giant Slayer*, another unimaginative retelling of a ever-popular children's story. *Jack The Giant Slayer* reeked with the air of ""Who Is This For?"", which is rearing its ugly head again with *Pan*. *Jack* opened with $27M against very weak competition (the *Project X*-wannabe with *21 &amp; Over* and long-delayed horror sequel *The Last Exorcism Part 2*) and this weekend, *Pan* does not have that luxury. *The Martian* is absolutely dominating the market and *Hotel Transylvania 2* has its Adam Sandler paws on the family crowd, and *Pan* will undoubtedly draw the short end of the stick. Unlike *Jack* however, *Pan* will not be playing in 3D as WB cancelled its 3D run days before the release, which just reeks of cutting losses while they can.

WB has been pushing Hugh Jackman's turn as Blackbeard heavily in its advertising, but they seem to forget that Jackman is nowhere near a box office draw without his Wolverine claws. Jackman has only led a non-*X-Men* film past $100M domestic twice in the last 15 years, 2004's *Van Helsing* ($51M/$120M) and 2012's *Les Miserables* ($27M/$148M) - and *Pan* has neither prime release date that those two enjoyed (1st weekend of the summer and Christmas Day, respectively). 

The controversy surrounding the casting of vanilla-milk-and-Wonderbread-tinted Rooney Mara as Tiger Lily hasn't been huge, but I can't imagine it helped awareness of the movie. Director Joe Wright has had to come out publicly in defense of his decision, but Mara recently apologized for taking the part, saying she ""felt bad about it"" and initially wanted no part of the role.

[*Pan* trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0l434lvmGw)

The ^Prediction: *Pan* will fail to attract audiences of any kind, making WB 0 for 2 with their fairy tale adaptation attempts. It will open to only $19M, grabbing 4 Top 5 points, 1 PTA point, and topping out at $51M - good enough to guarantee we won't be getting a sequel centering on Hedlund's Hook as the villain. 


Note: *The Walk* will expand into non-IMAX theaters to make room for Pan into 2,500 theaters. Seeing how bad it bombed in its IMAX-only run, I can only see JGL's French accent grossing $3M this weekend, making it a bomb of the highest degree. Broad Green Pictures will expand its critically acclaimed festival darling, *99 Homes*, into mini-wide release with a theatre count of roughly 700. It has an outside chance of breaking $1M, if it plays well.


This week's limited release...

**Steve Jobs (Universal)** - After a long and tumultuous trop from page to screen that was laid bare for the world to see in last year's Sony hack, Danny Boyle's biopic of one of America's most famous and most divisive figureheads of the last half century, Apple CEO Steve Jobs. People loved to love Jobs, and even more people (probably Android users) loved to hate the man behind the Mac, iPhone, iPad, Siri, Apple TV, and the most popular laptops on college campuses, the the Apple Macbook. *Steve Jobs*, scripted by Oscar-winner Aaron Sorkin (*The Social Network*), takes a non-traditional look at the innovator's life, using three major events of his career as a microcosm of the man himself instead of the typical two hour compression of a subject's entire life. The film will see Jobs (played by Oscar-nominee and date-r of Alicia Vikander, Michael Fassbender) as he introduces the Macintosh in 1984, the NeXt computer in 1988, and the iMac in 1998 - filled with flashbacks and flash forwards in between. The film currently sits at 91% on RT and co-stars Kate Winslet, Jeff Daniels, Katherine Waterson, and Seth Rogen as The Woz.

Universal will be opening *Steve Jobs* in a prime 4 theaters this weekend in NY and LA, before slightly expanding next weekend and going fully wide on Oct. 23rd. Not too long ago, it would've been Sony releasing this film this weekend, but in a very different form. Probably the biggest non-*The Interview* story that came out of last year's Sony leaked emails, the entire industry poured through exec's communications as they desperately tried to put this film together in its original iteration: directed by David Fincher and starring Christian Bale as Jobs. But when Angelina Jolie convinced Fincher to direct her Cleopatra film instead (with former Sony head Amy Pascal calling her a ""stuck up bitch"" in the process""), Bale passed on the film as did Sony's second choice - Leonardo DiCaprio. Sony shut the film down and Universal quickly snapped the script up, slotting in Danny Boyle as director and Fassbender as Jobs. This fiasco brought the film national attention before it was even done filming, and will probably move the needle in the right direction at the box office.

Unlike the ill-fated Ashton Kutcher starrer from 2013, Universal is selling *Steve Jobs* on its unique layout and an All-Star cast - not just a look alike in recreations of famous photos. The film was the centerpiece of this year's New York Film Festival and amassed rave reviews soon thereafter - particularly for Fassbender's turn and Sorkin's 200+ page script, both of which figure to feature at this year's Oscars. Almost a lock for 10 PTA points, *Steve Jobs* will also open wide against a weak field of long delayed genre films and another *Paranormal Activity* that absolutely no one is anticipating. Depending on how the holdovers from the 16th hold, it has an outside chance of grabbing #1 at the box office. The comparison Universal would like is 2011's *The Social Network* ($22M/$96M), which would've easily been attainable had they stayed with the wide release this weekend. But opening only two weeks before *Spectre* will cut into its legs deeply.

**My predictions for the weekend of October 9th-11th:**

1. The Martian - $38M
2. Hotel Transylvania 2 - $22M
3. Pan - $19M
4. Sicario - $7M
5. The Intern - $6.5M


This week in Box Office History...

1994 - The world was given proof that wunderkind director Quentin Tarantino wasn't a one-hit, blood-soaked wonder when *Pulp Fiction* was released unto the movie going public. It opened to #1 with a $9M weekend starting a 5 weeklong Top 5 streak, ending up with $107M as the 10th highest grossing film of the year and 7 Oscar nominations, including Best Director and Best Picture. It also cemented Samuel L. Jackson and resurrected John Travolta as movie stars and each were Oscar-nominated, but strangely enough neither has been nommed since. *Wes Craven's New Nightmare*, a *Nightmare on Elm Street* reboot of sorts, opened to $6 at the #3 spot, and the best football-themed kids movie of all time, *Little Giants*, could only muster a #5 opening with $4M."
3o48tw,4,2015-10-09,Me [21M] with my gf[21F] of one year graduate undergrad this spring. Questions about how to weigh our relationship versus our careers?,lukekarasa,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3o48tw/me_21m_with_my_gf21f_of_one_year_graduate/,"We are undergraduate students and we have both agreed that our relationship is something new to us. We haven't ever felt okay with the idea of a LTR until now. Our careers are both doable in many cities, so we have discussed many times where we want to live after school. I am a CS (computers) major, and can pretty much find a job if I need one, where ever I am. She is an ES (environmental) major and doesn't have the flexibility I do.


Our plan was to go where she could find work and I would adjust. We talked this morning and she said she's investigating a program where she'd work abroad, in Greece. I doubt I would be able to tag along on such an adventure.


We had this conversation 3 months into our relationship wherein we decided that the relationship was worth taking a shot at because our careers aspects were so unpredictable. So...why not? We were also concerned that we'd have to split come graduation, but have ultimately acted and continued as if we were not going to. This is known and agreed upon, that we'd make an effort to find careers in the same location.


This new program in Greece changes everything. We have always agreed that a LDR is not feasible for us as we are very sexual and need to be in the moment, i.e. internet doesn't do it for us. The program lasts a year.


It seems her priorities have shifted. I am willing to up and leave wherever necessary. It appears she is not willing to make similar sacrifices. 


**I have a few questions.**


To those who have been here before... the cliche first love in college. What did you do? Did you compromise and find a location where both could succeed? Did one of you take a hit with your career for the sake of the relationship? Is that even a wise decision this early in life?


To those who tried a LDR for a year... was it easy to try and come back together after so much time apart?


My other concern is that we do not know if the Greece program will pan out until December. I do not like the idea of waiting around until then only to find out the relationship is doomed. But if the program doesn't work, we have a much greater chance of finding a place where we can both succeed and maintain the relationship (assuming the failed program means she'd stay in the states).


**tl;dr**: I'm not sure it's fair for me to wait around and see if my gf gets an internship (?) abroad, in order to determine if the relationship can continue as LDRs are a no-go for us. To those who have been in similar situations, what did you do under what circumstances and why?"
3o4ojw,2,2015-10-09,Kansas,Hobothug,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3o4ojw/kansas/,"You went away to law school; not so much for you, you said, but because it was what your parents expected. But I knew deep down that it was for you - that you would be good at it, that you would enjoy the thinking and arguing and writing and technicality of it. You definitely enjoyed the prestige of it, of telling people that you were going; and you promptly bought law school stickers for your truck. But, as soon as you accepted the invite, you changed. You weren't just you anymore; you were you-going to law school. You had the smallest of chips on your shoulder; but it was ok, because it is quite the accomplishment and you were proud of it, and I love you.

All summer though, you talked about how much you enjoyed your internship at the police department. How you wished that you could just be a cop instead, and forget doing 3 more years of tedious studying. I thought that suited you so much better; but ""the money"" you said. We talked about ""average"" incomes and money and happiness; entry level police officer jobs in our town pay a pretty good ""Average"" wage. ""But I want to be more than average"" you said. That's ok. Ambition is good. Not worth being miserable for, I don't think, Mr. ""I don't actually want to be a lawyer"", but you can make your own decisions.

And then fall came, and you moved so far away. Far away for law school; to a place you didn't know anyone or anything. But you have a full-ride, so I get it. And you wanted me to come with you. But I just couldn't; it was too far away, I'd gotten the job I wanted here, my friends were here, I'm pretty happy here. It's not too far away from my family, I got an apartment that I like, I'm making and saving a ton of money, paying off my student loans; my life is here. And I was kind of willing to re-evaluate the situation; but not right away. I wanted to make sure that you were going to stay in law school. That you were going to like it. And I always told you that you could come home and live with me if it didn't work out. I wasn't ready to drop everything in life without being sure. And I definitely wasn't interested in staying there forever. Maybe until you were done with law school; but not any longer than that.

But you're pretty tough and pretty driven, and you're doing ok. But your tune started changing a little bit. It went from ""I'm here for Law School"" to ""Even if I wasn't in law school, I'm not coming back"". When things were going rough at school, and you started looking at police officer jobs, you didn't even look back here, where I am. You only wanted Kansas. Going there for your full-ride, I understand and support. Staying in a place where you know nobody, just because ""It's not Illinois"" I don't. You say your family doesn't mind the drive, you didn't believe in the friendships you had here... fine. But all of that is the opposite for me. Why would I drop it all and move to Kansas with you ""just because it's not Illinois?"" Illinois has been great to me so far. I've lived my whole life here. My whole life is here. 

Your whole Kansas thing went from being about school to being about Kansas, and it started to sound every bit as selfish as you think I was in staying here for my friends and family and job; except I think your side was worse because aside from school, you have no reason to stay there other than ""I really like it here.""

And that's when I started to make up my mind. Now I was really never going to move to Kansas. Ever. Because moving to Kansas wouldn't be about supporting you while you were in school. Kansas would be about you ""not living in Illinois"" while I sacrificed my friendships, career, and ability to visit family for our relationship. 

And then you came up with this ""compromise"" - where I live with you in Kansas for 7 years while you finish school and start your career and then we move back... but I don't see how that was any kind of compromise. 7 years is a huge long time, and you're asking me to then uproot my life twice, and plus then you get what you want all upfront, and how do I know that I'll get what I want 7 years down the line? And in 7 years from now, the things that are important to me now won't be here. Or if they're here, they won't be a part of my life anymore in the way that I want them to be. Moving to Kansas really does mean trading all of my fulfilling things for only a handful of yours.

I love you so much. I love your sense of humor, and your good looks, and our nighttime adventures in the country, and your love of police cars, and your intelligent conversation, and your big loud rumbly truck, and your family and your dogs and your grandmother, and your stories, and you accent (which you claim you don't have but you do) and your hometown, and your cooking; I would marry you and have kids with you and grow old with you; but our relationship had to end because it's come to a point where we can't find a middle ground. We both would have to give up something too big, and we'd resent each other forever because of it.

I'm so heartbroken...

3o5efr,2,2015-10-09,Seeking some perspective. I feel like I'm going mad/being played.,[deleted],Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/3o5efr/seeking_some_perspective_i_feel_like_im_going/,"Ok, so this is going to be a long post. I know that right now. Also, if you don't read the first post you won't understand a lot of stuff, but the TL;DR is that I am an atheist that had a lot of crazy stuff happen to me over the last two months whilst hanging out with a group of Christians.

About a month ago I made this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/3jsshq/a_long_series_of_coincidences_i_dont_know_anymore/

I deleted the account because I'm a very private person, so you will have to take it on faith that I am the same person.

Anyway, to sort of pick up the story where I left off, I am still attending the campus ministry meetings. In fact, I actually started going to church with the interns. The coincidences stopped, and things were going fairly well.

However, It would be safe to say at this point that I'm not exactly a fan of the pastor of the church I am attending. He ended up saying some things that really caused me to reevaluate why I was hanging out with these people, which led me, last week to make a decision to cut contact with the group. 

I had signed up to go on a retreat with them, though, so I just told the leader to keep the deposit. However she messaged me back and told me that I needed to pay the balance in full even if I wasn't going. I was a little annoyed by this, but nevertheless arranged a meeting time with one of the interns so I could pay off the balance. 

Up to this point, I had not told them anything about what happened in the other post. However, since I thought it was the last time I was going to see these people, I figured they had a right to know both why I had been going, and why I was no longer going, so I told him the story in the other post. 

While I'm speaking with him, a bible study randomly starts right next to us. Let me be clear here. This is a huge campus, and literally while we are having this conversation, four girls decide to have a bible study at the table next to ours... I accuse him of orchestrating this and of course he denies, but undeterred, I pay him the balance due and walk off with the full expectation that I would never see him again. 

Well, it turns out that while I was having this meeting with the intern, the leader had done some research and discovered that I *don't* actually owe them the full balance after all... (at least, that's what she tells me..). So quite literally whilst I was meeting with the intern that I thought I would never see again, she messages me and tells me that now, I have a reason to see him again (to get paid back). 

So I message the intern that I gave the money to to arrange *another* meeting to get my money back. We sort of get into an argument, but it ends fairly amicably. I basically tell him ""Look, I realized I was going to these meetings for the wrong reasons.""

At this point I just want to be done. I just want my money back, and I just want to get on with my life. 

I go to Walmart to get some things and to take my mind off of everything. I'm standing next to the big freezers staring at the milk when someone walks up behind me and taps me on the shoulder. I turn around and see the man that had told me ""God bless you, brother"" the first two times. He is smiling but I get angry because I'm very suspicious of these people at this point (remember I accused the intern of orchestrating the bible study). I ask him why he is here in an agitated tone and he tells me he felt 'called', I get even angrier and tell him he is full of shit, when he says five words to me and walks off: ""Your understanding is not required"".

I'm thoroughly spooked at this point and go home. I immediately get on chat and tell the intern what happened whilst accusing him of orchestrating the whole thing. He denies of course and we get into a long discussion. Nothing really comes of it. 

I don't know what to think at this point, or what's going on. I feel like crap for a number of reasons, and I think I'm going crazy (still do..).

The following day I arrive at the place where I am to meet the intern to get paid back. As it turns out, some of the members are having a meeting in the same area (they definitely could have orchestrated this), but what was really crazy was that, while I'm sitting there waiting for the intern, I see 8 different people who have had an impact on my life in one way or another (to the point where I remember them), and this happens over the space of ~20 minutes. 

All of this is happening while I'm hearing the members of the group talk about me. It was surreal. (I don't think they knew I was there, but I can't be sure). When they end their meeting the leader turns around, sees me, and acknowledges me. I don't know why I said what I said but in that second I change my mind and tell her I'm going to the retreat. 

Less than a minute later the intern shows up to pay me back. 

Fast-forward to the weekend. I have a terrible first day at the retreat. I hated the atmosphere and a few shitty things happened to me, but it's not really relevant. I can't sleep so I find myself sitting in the worship center at 3:30 in the morning. I'm asking myself all sorts of questions like ""What am I doing here?"" and telling myself ""I don't belong here"", ""These people aren't your friends"", etc. We had been doing some bible study, and there were printouts of a bible passage all over the tables. The one directly in front of me was face up and whilst sitting there I had sort of been skimming the passage and what the person had written in the margins. I decided it would be interesting to read more of what others had wrote so I turn over the paper directly to my right.

At the very top of the page someone had written in big orange letters ""Can Jesus heal me?"". Within 5 seconds I get a text. It's one of those stupid chain texts that I have been getting (fairly new #). I've been blocking them as I get them, but the text says: ""Jesus heals all!""

These people don't know that number. I can't explain the above as anything other than a highly unlikely coincidence. 

Many other things happened over the weekend but all of it can be explained by the fact that they now know the first part of my story. 

I can't explain the text though.

You know the funny thing about this, though? I despise this group, truly. To be clear, I like the people, but I just can't stand the national organization. Every time I go to a meeting, or go to a church, I find something new to despise or disagree with. It's the insanity behind it all. 

There's really no question here, honestly I typed this up as much for myself as anyone else, but if you want offer some perspective feel free to do so.

3o5vz8,1,2015-10-09,I don't believe I will ever be successful,OMCdepression,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3o5vz8/i_dont_believe_i_will_ever_be_successful/,"I am 26. I am depressed. My dad literally is a narcissist, and I am not in contact with him. I went to college and got a B.S. in zoology.

I thought I would be a zookeeper. But I don't have someone to support me while I spend my time volunteering and doing unpaid internships to get enough experience to beat out other people when positions (rarely) open up.

I thought I would be a teacher. I had a statement of eligibility and a teaching minor that specialized in getting math and science majors into teaching. But that blew up in my face. I started out subbing, kept getting reinvited to schools, landed a long term sub position, and then got offered a job by the principal. But there was one catch - there was a hiring freeze at the moment, so they couldn't hire me until it was lifted. As I worked there, the administration treated me like garbage. When I reached out for help, they used it against me. 6 of 126 students had Fs, and I was blamed for them. Nevermind the fact that one of those students (6th grader) had been suspended for literally smoking pot in the bathrooms. Nevermind the fact that another of those students had attended literally only three days of school. And somehow two boys getting into a physical altercation with each other was my fault. I documented their horseplay the first week in the classroom. I asked for help from administration when they wouldn't abide by boundaries in the classroom. After they decided to not hire me, they separated the boys into separate class periods. When they decided to not hire me, the principal told me that I was ""so young"" and that ""maybe"" in a few years I would be ready. But she was also the one that told me they ""don't fail students"" there and if a student has a failing grade due to not attending school, or issues like that, then she ""finds another place for them"" meaning sends them to a different school. I was powerless and made to feel incompetent. And these things are not uncommon - there are loads of news stories about teachers being treated like garbage. If I try teaching again, I am going to wander from school to school trying to find a supportive administration, all the while being abused. I don't have the fortitude to be able to do that.

I thought I could work in an office. After that experience, it took me six months to find a job. I didn't expect it to take so long, and I was trying for anything. I figured I could work in an office. I am good with computers, great at solving problems, and can learn anything. So I finally got hired at a place from a temp position. They were having a lot of internal issues after one of the staff retired and her replacement turned out to be entirely incompetent and just up and left. I felt appreciated there. I felt valued there. In fact, I was so valued that people often came to me for help with random issues. Since my position was essentially office support, I figured it was a good thing. And it was. To everyone. Right up until the incompetent manager was fired. The new manager that took over didn't like me, I guess. The issue was that the place had been mismanaged for so long that it was causing a lot of difficulties with my job. My primary responsibility was to make sure the schedule was done. When the manager and the production manager made changes to the schedule, I had asked they let me know so that I could accurately plan and give accurate information to our sales reps and customers. Several times both myself and the other scheduler were kept out of the loop, and one day I made a mistake. I found out they had changed something without telling me, and I stormed back to the production manager's office and gave him an earful. The problem, you see, was that there were other employees in his office at the time. I got written up before I could talk to the manager about it, but not only for that. I was also written up for apparently not keeping an eye on the scheduling capacities (LIES!) and for not completing my work in a timely fashion (an issue that had only began existing when I was given too many new tasks by the manager himself - an issue that I tried to seek help from him about. Because it was both myself and the other scheduler that had too many tasks - she had the same problem.) When he spoke to me, he said ""maybe it's because you're young"". When he spoke to me, he said, ""I'm not saying you're going to be fired if you don't have X done by this time."" But he fired me - to the surprise of all the sales reps and other co-workers. I saw it coming, too, and the shitty thing was that I couldn't find another job in time.

I am applying to more and more jobs each week, but it doesn't seem to matter. My application goes off into cyberspace, never to be pulled for an interview. I have walked into places where I could talk to people, but it didn't matter. Handing out my resume didn't matter.

I've been working part-time as a tutor through all of this. The trouble is that since I have a job at all, my state won't cover health insurance. Since I have a job at all, I don't qualify for unemployment. It doesn't matter that it's only part time and can only be part time and will only ever be part time.

I can't shake the feeling that there are no opportunities for me because I am not supposed to exist. I am not suicidal, but I think about it a lot. I think about drowning. A lot. Because I could build in a release - tie myself with a knot that can easily be undone if I really wanted to, but if I didn't really want to untie it, then I had my answer. But I wouldn't do it. But I can't help but think about it often.

I've given myself [the moviestar speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKEUqgLd4-I) from Bojack. But I can't make myself believe. I have re-watched the episode of Rick and Morty where Morty tells Summer ""Nobody exists on purpose. Nobody belongs anywhere. Everybody's gonna die."" a hundred times, but it doesn't matter, because I can't get to a level point. My friends keep telling me that things will work out. BUT THEY DON'T ALWAYS. That's why there are homeless people. And a poverty cycle. Because they don't. THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THINGS DON'T WORK OUT. And I don't want to be a part of it.

It's easy for them to say that. Two of my friends who are married (also 26) own a house. One of them is going to grad school, and the other has a job because both of her parents are still married and have worked at the same company for a long, long time. But I can't seem to get a job there, even applying to and taking their ""suggestions.""

I could probably go work where my dad works - that is where my brother works. And then be around someone that psychologically abused me for 17 years of my life. Every. Day. Be around him. Because he doesn't respect boundaries. And then what, when he keeps coming up to me and I break down and cry at work all the time because he's there? Get fired again? Have my brother bear some of the brunt of me being fired because my dad is an asshole?

Whenever I talk to my mom about this, she just gets upset and says she wishes she could help. She doesn't have any pull at her job and is miserable there anyway because administration a couple levels higher than her views her department as ""just an expense."" Should I willingly apply to a job where I know I will be miserable too? When I am already miserable? She also is helping my narcissistic/alcoholic single-mom sister raise my nephew. I love him. He is just unfortunately the result of a series of poor decisions from my sister that also resulted in me getting pushed out of the house. My mom constantly chooses her over me. And it is frustrating to know that I don't have a place to go. Because I can't live with my sister again. Not if she still drinks ever. Because she's an insane person that doesn't respect boundaries when she drinks.

I have talked to my brother about this - I won't do it again. He got to feeling just as depressed and lost as I felt for a few days.

I can't keep talking to my married friends about it. One of them doesn't understand. He keeps telling me things will get better. It is so easy for him to say that - he has opportunities, and he has someone that can fund it. And his wife, my best friend, she just doesn't know what to say or do, and ends up saying nothing. The last time I was totally honest with them about all of it, we ended up in a huge argument, where I was told that I was being too negative. It is true that I feel like I have no opportunities.

I don't have a boyfriend to talk to. I broke up with my last boyfriend because, among other things, he was completely unsupportive, manipulative, and I started to see how he was being psychologically abusive to me. And the one before that, who I had been with for 7 years, was no longer making me a priority in his life at all.

I don't have anyone that can support me doing things. I don't have any choices that make things better that I am not already doing - I keep applying, knowing that I will probably never be called for an interview.

I don't have any choices. I don't have any options. I cannot make anything better, and I have exhausted the people around me when I have tried to reach out. They say they'll listen. They say I can tell them anything, but when I do, they tell me that I need to start thinking positively, and that something will work out. BUT IT WON'T. And they can't see that. I am not saying it won't because I am sabotaging anything. I am saying that it won't because I keep ending up in this position where I am restarting.

Again, restarting.

Again, restarting.

And it is longer and longer each time.

I am 26 and I have no future, and I just want to get into an accident so that I die."

While I was working a couple of nights ago my apartment had been broken into for a second time. The first time the thief had only taken my old Xbox 360 and some cash I had laying around. So I wasn't too upset around the issue. This time it couldn't have happened at a worse time. This time the thief had taken my MacBook Pro, gaming desktop, brand new Xbox One, and my television. I had bought all of these items on my own throughout the years and worked my ass of for them. I have contacted the local police, but as with the first incident I doubt they will be able to recover any of the stolen property. If you guys think you could help me out by donating to my gofundme that would be greatly appreciated. Therefore I can buy myself another laptop for my studies for these last two semesters.

3o6a6w,5,2015-10-09,I’m [F 22] having problems with my SO [M 22] because I’m going through a temporary hard time right now and am stressed/depressed/have less time for him.,uh-whatever,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3o6a6w/im_f_22_having_problems_with_my_so_m_22_because/,"Hi. I’m in a kind of bad situation right now where I’m doing a required internship for school. It’s a fast paced medical environment, full time, very long commute, doesn’t pertain to my interests, and the work is somewhat above my skill level. It’s really stressful and has triggered anxiety and depression for me. It’s not a good fit for me but I have zero choice in the matter. I just have to get through it for another 5 weeks. That’s a problem in and of itself, but it’s affected my personal life at home as well. 

I have a boyfriend that I’ve dated and lived with for 6 years. We’ve had ups and downs in our dating history but the last couple years have been very stable and enjoyable. Typically we don’t have too much on our plates: neither of us have ever worked full-time before and we usually spend a LOT of time together and we like it that way. Well now that I’m working full time and have extra work to complete at home, we’re spending way less time together than usual. When I finally come home at night I’m exhausted: like I-could-crash-at-7pm kind of tired. We really can only have a couple of hours together and during those couple hours I’m not really myself: I’m either exhausted, depressed, anxious, or all three. I try to perk up but it’s not easy. 

Also, I have little interest in sex. I mean, I’d love to have sex but I’m so. effing. tired. I just can’t get into it when I feel this way. We’ve been having sex 2-3x per week when normally we’re used to sexual activity 5-6x/week. Now my boyfriend hates me. He doesn’t feel satisfied emotionally or sexually by me. He’s asked me to not come home to him if I’m not feeling like my normal self. But I’m not going to be my normal self until this internship is over. I don’t really know what else to do in this situation. I’ve tried expressing how I feel but it’s not getting through- he’s never experienced anxiety or depression so he can’t put himself in my shoes. 

He’s mentioned that if things don’t shape up by next week that he wants to break up. I don’t want this. I just want him to be supportive and understanding until this internship is over and we can get back to our normal lives. In case you’re wondering, I don’t plan on working full-time ever in the future because it’s not good for my mental health. I think if he would just wait it out like I’m waiting out this stressful situation, everything will be fine. Any advice about what we should do in the meantime?
   
**tl;dr**: My boyfriend is hating me and wants to break up because there’s way less quality time together during this internship I’m doing. How do I prevent a break up and make things right between us?"
3o6t18,0,2015-10-10,Signs that maybe the interview didn't go well?,mllax,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/3o6t18/signs_that_maybe_the_interview_didnt_go_well/,"On my resume, I have the fact that I'm currently IB analyst intern and for the last year or so, have been doing equity research for my university's portfolio, as well pitch decks for investors that sit in on my university's presentations.

My interviewer didn't seem impressed, telling me they have nothing to do with the position, and why I wanted to go into the said position, or if I even knew what the position entailed. His questions ended around 20ish minutes, and I asked him questions for the next 10, to fill in a 30 min gap. Maybe it was because we reached 30 minutes, but at the end of the last question, he immediately got up, handed me his card, giving me the cliche, ""write to me if you have further questions."" 

The only positive note I can think of was he would respond by saying my answers were great/good and applicable in the real world because x, y and z would occur in our position/firm. 

After being turned down by the big 4 every year since freshman year, I basically concluded I'm a shitty interviewee, despite having 3 internships. I left the interview room really ambivalent, and a little thinking he thought I was shit. 

Basically what are signs that the interview went poorly, and probably won't hear back for a 2nd round? Or based on what I wrote, what're your opinions? "
3o6xxh,8,2015-10-10,My Roommate/Best Friend [21 M] and I [22 M] have been having numerous disagreements involving my GF [22 F],throwaway199312345,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3o6xxh/my_roommatebest_friend_21_m_and_i_22_m_have_been/,"Where do I begin? 

I have known both my roommate (let's call him Brad) and my girlfriend (let's call her Gabby) for a long time. I've known Brad since I was three/four and known Gabby since we were fourteen and we eventually started dating sometime after that. 


Brad has always been fairly secluded. While I have known him for seemingly my whole life he has never had a girlfriend. This summer while Gabby was out of town for an internship he admitted to her (in confidence) that he liked her. Now, before you jump to conclusions Brad isn't the type of individual to try to break Gabby and I up. So I'm not and have not been worried about that. 

Instead. Brad has decided that he doesn't want to see her ever again. This is despite the previous year at college when we all hung out as a group. He wants none of that at all. Brad is intentionally forcing himself to no longer see Gabby because he likes her and doesn't want to. Also because he is envious of our relationship because he is single.
 

This weekend I decided to visit my family for the first time in about 3-4 years. I figured that it would be a good opportunity to invite Gabby to meet my family as well because she has never met my extended family. This whole plan came together fairly suddenly as I wasn't sure if Gabby could get off of work in order to come up for the weekend. When Gabby mentioned passingly that we were going to be visiting my family in Atlanta he grew irate that we were planning this without him and that he can ""take a hint"" if we wanted to spend the weekend together. 


I don't know how to deal with this situation. Brad is seriously starting to piss me off. I love him dearly but he's stubborn as all hell. There is really a lot more to this situation that I don't feel is relevant at the moment but I'm free to explain more if asked. 



TL;DR- My best friend starts to like my girlfriend and decides to stop liking her that he pretend she doesn't exist. He gets further pissed off when she comes over because it reminds him that he is single. (He doesn't truly try to date anyone). Won't let her come over at all and simply wants to deny she even exists.

[28F]?,redindian92,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3o74ee/how_do_i_23m_control_my_feelings_for_a_departing/,"So there is this woman, who I interned for at a law firm when I was still in law school. She is the prettiest person in the firm, and very energetic, fun and smart. She does not flinch while using expletives and is very up front with everything (something I find very attractive)

 She showed me the ropes and sort of taught me how to behave like a lawyer and I reported to her during my first internship, we got along really well. She is just an associate at the firm, and not someone senior (capable of making hiring decisions). 

Eventually as my time at law school came to a close, she told me that the firm is looking at past internees to see if they are interested in a job. I eventually went for an interview and got it. 

However, a couple of my classmates interned at the same firm 
and stated that they never got any call at the firm. I was not in touch with her till the day I joined and she stayed quiet about telling me over everyone else. Eventually, when I asked her, she gave me a cryptic reply stating that she did what she did because 'Some people care' (Which I interpreted in a totally non-romantic way). I eventually learned that not only did she only tell me, but she also recommended me to the partners behind my back and kept mum about it.

I am hopeless with meeting women, and I have serious personal issues (for more info, check out my posts),  which I don't have any time to discuss. When I joined, I learnt that she got married, a fact which admittedly made me sad.

 One day, She was working on the table opposite me, and I just kept staring at her face. She noticed it and typed something into Skype (Ours is a small firm, 12 associates and 3 partners, we use Skype as an internal communications tool). I got a message from her asking her why am I staring. I got embarrassed, told her I was 'zoned out' and resumed my work.

Five months down the line a new partner joins the firm. The new partner is simply put, a stupid woman. She is just a micromanager who keeps hovering above people and crimping their independence without actually contributing much to our knowledge of law. Both me and my colleague work under her, but she couldn't tolerate the new boss. 

Last week, when the boss asked us to come on a sunday, I agreed to, but she didn't arguing she had a family to take care of. The boss asked her to resign and she did. She took a gamble, but she also got another job in an instant, cause she is very good at what she does. I was among the first to know in the firm. 

Off late, she has gotten a bit emotional and more personal with me. She laughs at my jokes with an adorably cute giggle and has apologized for getting me to this firm. She has also been acting a little vulnerable around me by coming to me when she is panicking, or simply to vent out (she never used to do this earlier, before she quit). She has now offered to get me a couple of beers when a bunch of us go out in the next couple of days. 

Today is a working saturday (a day when we don't have to come with stupid formal clothes), she is currently wearing a tight t-shirt and I can't take my eyes off her :(. 

I guess this is an ordinary work crush, but she also got me my first job and I also owe her a lot professionally. I have a feeling she has some clue of how I feel.So now for my questions:

1.) I feel extremely sad that she is leaving, how do I deal with it?

2.) Do I tell her what I feel? (she is happily married). I am scared that I might blurt out something stupid after getting drunk.

3.) How do I convey my genuine feeling of professional gratitude without appearing too 'creepy' or stupid?


UPDATED: I DO NOT HAVE ANY HOPES to do anything with her. I know my feelings for her are inappropriate and I do not want to be a homewrecker at all. I am just wondering, will she be kinda pleased with herself if I tell her?, or should I avoid it altogether?


  tl;dr Have a crush on a colleague who got me my first job. She is leaving the job. I don't know what to do, I owe her a lot professionally, but I also have a crush on her. What do I tell her?"

I went to my boss, to tell him I'd chosen one of the two, and was told that the program needed to choose a female student this time around. I explained why either of the male candidates would be better choices, but boss explained that he felt, for appearances sake, that a female intern would be better.

I feel like a- my autonomy as IT head has been reduced, and b- we just deliberately hired an inferior worker just to be inclusive.

Since the student is an engineering student, she's not foolish. I'm sure, with 6 months of training, she will eventually be quite competent- but by then, she will most likely leave the company. 
What can I do to ensure her success, and to make sure this doesn't happen again?"
3o8tuv,4,2015-10-10,Entrevista completa a Gemma Ubasart a 'El Crític',CristianFerrerG,podemos,https://www.reddit.com/r/podemos/comments/3o8tuv/entrevista_completa_a_gemma_ubasart_a_el_crític/,"Gemma Ubasart: “Els mítings de Pablo Iglesias no havien d’eclipsar que érem una candidatura catalana”

La fins ara secretària general de Podem a Catalunya, Gemma Ubasart, ha presentat avui la seva dimissió davant del Consell Ciutadà del partit. Aquesta és l’única entrevista que donarà, almenys ara per ara, per explicar els motius de la seva marxa enrere després de menys un any a la direcció. Ubasart seguirà sent militant de Podemos i es plantejarà si seguirà o no com a secretària de Plurinacionalitat de la direcció estatal, però es mostra molt crítica amb l’excés de partidisme de Catalunya Sí Que Es Pot i les intervencions a Catalunya del líder de Pablo Iglesias contra la CUP i sobre els orígens d’una part dels catalans.

P: Per què dimiteixes precisament ara, i no abans?

Després de les eleccions del 27-S i amb l’inici de curs comença una nova etapa a Podem. És el moment adequat perquè jo faci un pas enrere. Jo he fet aquesta tasca durant un any de manera voluntària i militant compaginant-ho amb la meva feina a la Universitat. Jo em vull centrar en la meva carrera acadèmica en Ciències Polítiques. Entenem la política com gent normal fent política i li dedicarem un temps de les nostres vides a la política institucional. Jo vaig assumir el repte després de les eleccions europees per construir el partit a Catalunya. Ara ja tenim parlamentaris que han d’assumir un paper important en el futur de Podem. Jo continuaré sent militant i treballant per consolidar aquest projecte i per fer Pablo Iglesias president del govern espanyol. Sense Podemos no hi ha cap possibilitat de donar-li la volta al taulell polític i plantejar una resposta transformadora a la crisi de règim.

P: Però tu ets crítica amb la campanya electoral i la candidatura de Catalunya Sí Que Es Pot. Per quins motius?

Com a màxima dirigent de Podem a Catalunya, per acció o per omissió, assumeixo les responsabilitats d’uns resultats electorals que no han estat bons. Però hi ha coses que es poden replantejar per aprendre de cara al futur.

P Quines? Comencem pel principi.

Les eleccions del 27-S, plantejades com un plebiscit entre el sí i el no a la independència, eren difícils per a una formació com la nostra. Això facilitava les coses a formacions com Junts pel Sí i la CUP i el PP i Ciutadans. Això ho sabíem des d’un inici. Però nosaltres no vam saber construir un altre espai més enllà de l’eix nacional. És a dir, no en contra d’aquest eix, ni tampoc a favor, sinó superant-lo per poder reivindicar el nostre dispositiu de canvi. No parlaria d’una tercera via, sinó d’un altre espai.

P: Per què no heu estat capaços de construir-ho si ja sabíeu d’inici que les eleccions serien presentades com un plebiscit nacional?

Primer, no vam aconseguir prioritzar el caràcter ciutadà de la candidatura. Havíem d’haver transitat d’una coalició de partits a una confluència. Ens va faltar temps per construir-la, ens van faltar independents a la llista i ens va faltar cooperar amb Barcelona en Comú, Procés Constituent i altres espais político-socials.  I segon, no vam aconseguir sortir de la marginalitat unionista light on ens volien situar els mitjans de comunicació. La majoria del nostre discurs va allunyar-se d’aquest espai. Però algunes patinades van dificultar que sortissim d’aquest espai. No vam ser suficientment hàbils per sortir d’aquest espai del ‘no’. Quedar-te en aquest espai no serveix per guanyar eleccions a Catalunya. Ho diu sempre l’historiador Xavier Domènech: ‘Qualsevol projecte transformador i hegemònic a Catalunya ha de tenir un component catalanista. Sempre l’ha tingut’.

P: Creus que ha faltat perfil catalanista i han sobrat intervencions de dirigents polítics de Podemos?

No hem sabut dosificar les intervencions de dirigents estatals. És rellevant que vinguin i un valor afegit, però la seva presència va ser massa destacada. Nosaltres teníem un punt fort: hi ha un debat sobre la qüestió nacional i nosaltres som els únics que tenim una contrapart a l’Estat que entén la plurinacionalitat i el dret a decidir. Però més dosificada. Aquesta intervenció de dirigents estatals no havia d’eclipsar que érem una candidatura pròpia catalana.

P: Pablo Iglesias va dir en un míting de campanya: “Esa gente de barrio, esa gente de barrio que no vota tiene que sacar los dientes. Esa gente de barrio que no se avergüenza de tener abuelos andaluces o padres extremeños tiene que sacar los dientes“. Ajudava o no a guanyar vots?

La frase no era la més adequada ni la millor expressió. Però també cal dir que Pablo Iglesias està sota la lupa al màxim dels mitjans de comunicació i que es va obviar per complet el context en el que surt aquella frase.

P: Quina solució vas proposar tu per trencar amb un debat dual del sí-no en una campanya com la del 27-S?

No era fàcil. En plena campanya tot és molt complex, no es veu tot tan clar i jo ara faig la meva valoració amb ànim d’aprendre i millorar pel futur. Havíem de plantejar sense por la nostra proposta nacional de llarg recorregut i plenament viable. Però era difícil d’explicar en un moment de simplificació dels discursos. Havíem de continuar explicant, i crec que Lluís Rabell ho ha fet molt bé, la nostra proposta per poder exercir el dret a l’autodeterminació i buscar les fórmules per fer una consulta amb garanties. Nosaltres tenim una resposta en clau nacional que crec que és bona. El mateix Alex Salmond, exprimer ministre d’Escòcia, apuntava l’altre dia que la mateixa sortida que nosaltres proposem. Però l’àmbit nacional no era l’àmbit on nosaltres havíem de centrar la nostra campanya. Havíem d’haver potenciat més l’eix de radicalitat democràtica i l’eix social.

P: Vau quedar atrapats en un discurs del ‘no’ i d’anar a la contra de l’independència?

Exacte. El que havíem de fer era construir en positiu i amb missatges emotius per radicalitat democràtica i en polítiques socials.

P: Per què no ho vas dir abans? Què vas fer per evitar el que ara critiques? No et van deixar canviar-ho?

No és això. Tot és molt complex i el context electoral era molt complicat. La campanya electoral s’anava construint dia a dia. Hi havia gent dins de Podem que apostaven per anar cap a una disputa del vot amb Ciutadans. Però jo crec que a Catalunya, amb una candidatura com la nostra, anar a batallar vots a Ciutadans significa perdre. Mai seràs tan espanyol com Ciutadans i, en canvi, intentar disputar-li vot t’allunya d’una part del teu electoral més catalanista. Nosaltres volíem arribar a un espai molt ampli en l’eix nacional però no centrar-nos en l’eix nacional.

P: Dins de Podem hi ha un sector més espanyolista i més partidari de la unitat i un altre sector més catalanista i partidari radical del dret a decidir?

Jo crec que això és dir massa. Hi ha pluralitat en l’eix nacional. Però no veig sectors diferents. Veig més que hi ha un debat sobre quina és la millor estratègia per arribar a la ciutadania davant d’unes eleccions.

P: Parlem de Procés Constituent. És cert que Podemos no veia clar un pacte amb ells i molt menys una candidata com Teresa Forcades?

S’ha de dir que hi va haver un debat intern dins de Procés Constituent sobre si anar o no a la candidatura de Catalunya Sí Que Es Pot i, al final, ells ho van descartar. Segurament la decisió de Procés Constituent necessitava uns tempos de debat molt més llargs que els que teníem la resta d’actors. Però és cert que tots els partits vam tenir una visió excessivament partidista en l’elaboració de les llistes. A Catalunya necessitàvem construir un subjecte per la transformació molt ampli. Podem té un paper important però cal tenir més en compte els altres actors socials i polítics. Això és una característica pròpia de Catalunya que no passa en altres llocs de l’Estat. Ens hauríem d’inspirar molt més en la filosofia del PSUC d’aglutinar molts sectors i diferents ànimes més enllà de Podem si volem ser un projecte hegemònic amb capacitat de disputar l’hegemonia.

P: Però Procés Constituent havia decidit que Forcades fos la seva candidata i, en canvi, Podem ho va rebutjar, no?

Sí. Vam defensar des del primer moment que cap dels actors que confluïa podia imposar com a número 1 el que era el seu candidat. Necessitàvem un candidat de consens.

P: Podemos ha criticat la CUP per les relacions que ha pogut o no tenir amb Convergència, per exemple, durant la consulta del 9-N. Fins i tot Pablo Iglesias va criticar durament en un míting l’abraçada de David Fernàndez i Artur Mas. Com ho veus?

Jo crec que la crítica a l’abraçada va ser una errada. Posar-lo com un element important del primer míting de presentació a Catalunya de Podemos va ser una errada. Pablo Iglesias també ho ha reconegut. Crec que espais com la CUP, Procés Constituent o d’altres no han de ser objecte de les nostres crítiques. I menys una figura com David Fernàndez, que és un company de viatge de moltes aventures polítiques dels últims vint anys. Podem tenir debats i podem no estar d’acord, però crec que hem de comprendre’ns i respectar-nos més. Som al mateix costat de la barricada.

P: T’ha perseguit una polèmica sobre unes suposades declaracions teves demanant agitar “l’odi a Artur Mas”. Et reafirmes o creus que també va ser un error?

Aquest tema és un clar exemple del nostre amateurisme i de la manipulació que es va fer des de l’establishment. Allò va succeir a l’inici del projecte de Podem. Convergència necessitava construir a Podem com l’enemic. Jo dubto que pronunciés la paraula odi perquè no encaixa gens en la meva manera de ser ni de pensar. Aquesta polèmica surt d’una trobada que jo faig amb una periodista d’El Periódico de Catalunya. No era una entrevista sinó una conversa informal. No s’hauria d’haver publicat. Però, en tot cas, assumeixo que va ser un error no actuar bé davant dels mitjans de comunicació. Vam optar en aquell moment per no dir res ni explicar-nos millor, i la bola es va fer més gran. Ara encara em continuent atacant per això. Nosaltres no estem d’acord en agitar l’odi cap a ningú ni hem fet mai una política en aquesta direcció.

P: T’has sentit incòmoda en algun moment com a líder de Podem per defensar qüestions que no eren molt coherents amb la teva trajectòria política anterior a Podem a les Candidatures Alternatives del Vallès -que ara tenen vincles amb la CUP-, al moviment antiglobalització o, fins i tot, com a assessora del govern de Correa a l’Equador?

Un dels valors de Podem és les ganes de construir projectes polítics amplis i, alhora, la voluntat de governar. Construir projectes de majories pot voler dir assumir complexitats i contradiccions. No és fàcil per a cap dels dirigents de Podem, ni a Catalunya ni a l’Estat. No sempre pots ser la cara bonica i la cara amable amb tots els subjectes polítics dels que formaves part. Jo, però, ho veig com un element positiu per poder transformar la societat.

P: Personalment, et sap greu haver-te enemistat o haver rebut crítiques dures d’antics companys de viatge?

Els atacs sempre fan més mal quan vénen del foc amic que de l’establishment. De l’establishment ja t’ho esperes i fins i tot és desitjable. Hem de dialogar i debatre sobre propostes polítiques que poden no entendre’s en un moment donat. A Catalunya no hem sabut trobar espais de debat tranquil amb projectes polítics d’esquerres.

P: Però alguna cosa malament haurà fet Gemma Ubasart, no? Fas autocrítica d’aquest any al capdavant de Podem?

Sí, faig autocrítica. No haver-me pogut dedicar al 100%. Jo vaig voler continuar amb la meva feina a la Universitat. Això genera disfuncions. Ho accepto. Però no volia deixar la meva carrera professional per dedicar-me només a la política. Per això no he pogut tenir una relació fluïda amb tots els cercles de Podem al territori, ni tampoc una presència contínua als mitjans de comunicació. Reconec que, tot i que ha de ser una feina bàsica d’un polític, em costa la relació amb els mitjans.

I learned a lot from her. I wanted to tell her how much I appreciate having had the opportunity to work with her since I don't know whether we will work the same shifts again before I'm off to the next internship.

Since I'm just out of the grasp of depression this has been the first awesome collaboration I've ever had.(which I'm not going to tell)

I started by telling her that I respect her a lot but I felt like she doesn't like compliments because she retorted immediately with a compliment on my language skills.
 
I want to let her know how I think she's a saint.

On the other hand I don't want to force it.

3o9h6i,0,2015-10-10,I'm unhappy at my college for the price I am paying. I want to transfer but my parents refuse to consider it. How can I argue with them using finances?,eduardoquickfoot,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3o9h6i/im_unhappy_at_my_college_for_the_price_i_am/,"I am a first year Out-Of-State student at a prestigious engineering school, however this was never the school I wanted to go to. I wanted to go to an instate school that I felt was a better fit for me academically and socially (and much much cheaper). However my parents are very big on rank and reputation and threatened to withdraw any financial support for me as well as pressured me through relatives and friends and I ended up resignedly committing to the out of state school.

My family is definitely not rich (Dad found a job just two years ago) and we are sinking almost all our savings (28k) plus around 15k in gift money from relatives in order to pay for my first year in college.
I am told that hereafter I will have to take out full loans for the next three years.



Here are some facts:

Tuition: 30,000

Room &amp; Board: 13,000

Scholarships: 0

Federal Loans: 3,000

Major: Computer Science

In state school cost: 4,000 (tuition) + 10,000 (room and board)

Family income: 110,000

We just bought a 500k house two years ago.

Two younger siblings

As far as I'm aware very small savings



The primary reason I want to transfer is because I feel I am overpaying for a college experience I am simply not enjoying (both inside and outside the classroom).  Additionally I believe it is unfair that I have to shoulder the burden of repaying loans for a college I didn't even (and still don't) want to attend.

Whenever I bring up my concerns about taking out full loans for the next three years (which should be 100k to 150k dollars), my parents say I am foolish and naive and that it is easily repayable. 

My mother argues that if I earn 10k a summer from internships and live frugally once I graduate I should easily repay it. I have linked her websites cautioning taking too much debt but she claims that white people don't know how to manage finances (we are a first generation asian family). She claims that I can get a much better job from my current school than from the instate school. I am both uneasy about trusting her and still discontent with having to shoulder this burden for something I never wanted.

Are there any arguments I could present financially (they won't listen to anything else) that could persuade them to support a transfer?"

3o9vmd,7,2015-10-10,"Me (31/m) with my wife (31/f) together for 13 years, married for 4. Not compatible for a few years. I want to keep trying, but is it time to get divorced?",devilwiththerunning,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3o9vmd/me_31m_with_my_wife_31f_together_for_13_years/,"My wife and I met the first day of college orientation and have been together ever since.


During college, we had a ton in common. We were both great students, great athletes, enjoyed the same things, and were great together. There was always a small incompatibility issue with sex (I wanted it much more), but I met her halfway. Sure, there were fights just like any relationship, but we always made it through.


I took a job across the country after college for a year. She stayed home and attended grad school. We saw each other once/month (flying home, etc). and things stayed great. I quit my job for the sole fact that I didn't want our relationship to end. I took a job at home and she finished up grad school.


We bought a house and moved in together. She began working two jobs, a regular job and a paid internship. We pretty much only saw each other on weekends. The sex had been tapering off...but it was at the point that it was once/month. I brought it up several times that it was an issue. She said she didn't like sex and was not interested and only did it for me. She refused to see a doctor to see if she suffered from low libido or if she had any other medical issues. She said I needed to accept her for the way she was...and that a doctor was not going to fix her sexual desire.


Sex continued to be bland. When we did have sex, she clearly wasn't interested. I knew she did it just to do it.


She began (what I thought was) starting arguments more on small things (cleaning, chores, etc.) but there was really no need for it. She would complain about how certain parts of the house were not clean when she wasn't contributing at times.


It got to a point where we were fighting every day. Every single day. And we would only be seeing each other a couple of hours a day due to work...so imagine that. I suggested a relationship counselor to try to work on things. She refused and said she was not going to waste money on it. I told her it's important to me that we try to work this out. She said we didn't need a counselor. I told her that we were through. She broke down and got very emotional...saying she would change. I gave in and said okay.


Things were fine for a year...and then started getting bad again. During the time things were good...I proposed. Once we got married...things were again fine for a while...then were on and off.


We're 31 now. Our sex life is the worst it has ever been. For her, she claims that she doesn't really care about sex and could go without it. However, she wants to start trying to have kids..and that sex would be worth it then. In fact, she wanted to start having kids four years ago. I told her that we would start trying to have kids once we had a normal sex life...so that was going to be her decision.


During the entire time we have been together...she refuses to compromise on things. When we argue, she often gives 3-7 day bits of silent treatment in that she won't say a single word to me (this is what her parents did to teach other when she was growing up).

I'm no saint, but I really don't know what to do anymore. I know she really wants kids. I do too...but our relationship is not good right now...and our sex life is horrible. Not to mention she doesn't even want to go out on weekends anymore. She was always a homebody (and I was fine with that for the most part)...but she doesn't even want to go to concerts, out to eat, etc. basically anything on the weekend. She goes to sleep at 9pm each night.

I'm really not sure what do to. We have been through so much together. We have seen each other grow up and be successful in each of our careers...and have been there for each other. The fighting and the incompatibility is really showing through these days though. Have I always wanted a family with her? Absolutely. But having a kid when the relationship is like this I doubt will solve things.

She won't see a relationship counselor, we are sexually incompatible, she never wants to do anything fun, and quite frankly, is almost always irritatable.

I'm not a quitter. I took a vow to love and care for this woman for the rest of my life. I love her more than anything. I just don't know what else I can do. I am all for sacrifices...but my quality of life has started to diminish. I walk around on eggshells not wanting to say the wrong thing, etc.

Personally, I think I would be fine on my own. I think I know what I need to do. I do NOT think she would be okay with a divorce...and I think she would crumble. I don't want her to. Because I love her and because she doesn't deserve it. I just don't know what else to do. Thanks in advance everyone.
   
**tl;dr**: My wife and i have been together for 13 years. We are no longer compatible and always fight. Is it time to end it while we are still young (sort of) and move on?"

First time poster, but had a rough fight via whatsapp call with my LDGF, to the point I'm worried I'll lose her,so really looking for some perspective and/or advise from a non-biased source. 

To give you the long version, we have been together apx 5.5 years, 3 of those doing long distance from the US (Boston then Chicago once I got a job after college) to Austria, 1 year of Chicago to Minnesota (she was studying abroad for a year) and now a little over a year of Germany (my company has a major office in Frankfurt) to Austria.  She is in latter stages  of getting her masters in education in Austria which typically takes 8+ years (7+ years  of studying and 1 year internship which must be completed in Austria) but through shear force of will power she should be able to finish (with internship) in 7.  This (coupled with the distance) buts a great deal of stress on her from a school work and side job standpoint to the point that it impacts her health and mental well being (from a bike accident she suffers from chronic headaches that get worse with stress or lack of sleep, and has all but forfeitted a student life to accomplish this speed).  

After she studied abroad for a year in Minnesota and living with me in Chicago for the summer, I was able to get a transfer from my company to our office in Frankfurt when she had to go back to Austria.  To an American, this is a great victory of diminishing the distance, but to her/other Europeans this is little to no improvement.  Though things were great at first (going from seeing each other 3-4 times a year to 1-2 times a month on weekends), lately things have been strained.  She has stated that she cannot do long distance anymore and is frequently depressed (and admitted to me that she has cried herself to sleep at least once a week the past 5.5 years, hiding this from me the whole time).  She has also stated that my immaturity (the fight was over the fact that I spend 400 euros per month on groceries/drinks with friends on travel to see her and now joined a gym from 55 euros a month - all of which to her is ""dumb and ridiculous"") and that she feels taken for granted (she works so hard, has no student life while I go out with friends) - specifically that I have not surprised her at her doorstep (which is tough to do with my job and her study schedule to find a weekend to surprise her).  

For these reasons, she has put it on me to find a solution to the distance or she will leave me.  This would either be by leaving the job I have - which I like quite a lot (she still resents me for not moving to Austria after university even though I did not speak German at the time and would most likely have ended up working in service job after my parents paid for my expensive tuiton) by finding a new job in Austria (not easy given my lack of connections there) or by having my company transfer me there (which would be more ideal, but VERY difficult given our Vienna office is tiny compared to Frankfurt).  

I love my GF and do not want to lose her, but I also like my job a lot (she  cannot move to Germany - and would not want to), so I am at a lose of how to cheer her up or find a solution.  

What do you think? What should I do? Do you agree with what she says about me? Am I missing something (I am terrible at reading subtle signs)?  

TL; DR - My LDGF states she can no longer do long distance and that my immaturity and that I take her for granted mean that I need to find a solution by either leaving the job I like a lot, finding a new one (no guarantee), or get a transfer to where she is (more ideal, but still no guarantee).  Advise/perspective on this is welcome.   "

3oac9y,1,2015-10-10,Convinced myself I have HSV.,silkeeeejohnson,STD,https://www.reddit.com/r/STD/comments/3oac9y/convinced_myself_i_have_hsv/,"Hey gang, 

I need to know I am not alone right now, and could really use some compassion. 

But first, some back story: 

This whole saga started about a month and a half ago while looking for a place to live, somewhat frantically. I had been posting on FB looking for anyone in need of a roomie, to which this girl I knew from an internship replied saying he was in the same situation. She comes over one evening one day to help look for places...but instead of doing that, we bone. And how. 

A week goes by and we have sex a few more times, not all of which were protected. I felt fine, until I notice some tingling feelings during urination and occasional discomfort emanating from my junk a week or so after the fact. I thought very little of it, as I'd never had an STI and had nothing to compare the feelings to. 

I then also found out she escorts on the side and has the most ACTIVE Fetlife page ever, and is a major casual sex practitioner.

I flip my shit, and feelings of regret, panic, and paranoia now grip my soul. She says she's safe and gets tested regularly, but she might as well have just looked at me an said ""cat, dog, or pencil"" because all I could hear was the sound of my heart pounding in my ears.  

So I go get tested and am diagnosed with NGU and test positive for chlamydia. Which came as much of a relief, because I was scared out of my mind and thought I had the clap, or herpes, or cancer of the rectum, and everything else under sun. And still kind of do...

I don't even know where I pulled the herpes association from, I just kind of convinced myself I have it. And although I tested NEGATIVE, my mind still races and I sometimes panic that any weird pain, itching or discomfort, however mild, is the herpes stopping by to say hello and ruin my life. 

In reality, I am probably fine because I am past the time frame where people typically show signs of their first outbreak. But my mind still wanders to crazy, irrational places. I feel so embarrassed, and disappointed in myself for letting the panic consume me the way it has.

Has anyone else ever gone though this? Please let me know I'm not alone, and please do not be mean. I need you reddit. "

3ocyum,8,2015-10-11,Career advice for 23 y/o,craygeeboy,vba,https://www.reddit.com/r/vba/comments/3ocyum/career_advice_for_23_yo/,"A little background before I unload.

I graduated with an econ major last year from a state university that is decent (top 60). I had a 2.9 GPA because I'm a dumbass that prioritized things like club sports, fraternity stuff and other extracurricular activities over my studies. On top of that, I didn't have any internships and worked at restaurants during my breaks. So right after I graduated last year, I was unemployed for two months and finally got an offer for a temp position at my current company as a biller after sending out hundreds of applications. They paid me $13 an hour and I was mindlessly entering invoices for about 4 months until this guy in reporting jumped ship to another company. So they offered me a full time position for $15 an hour to replace this guy. It was more like this though: “Congrats craygeeboy we like your work ethic and we want to award you by giving you this opportunity to become a full time employee for $15 an hour.” I took it because well it beats $13 and it’s better than being unemployed.

So here I am now, a reporting guy who prepares reports for my company and its clients. To give a basic description of what I do, I have a reporting schedule that has various types of reports for different accounts that runs daily, weekly, monthly or quarterly. The number of reports in my schedule is over a hundred and growing (I’ll get back to this later)… I basically pull data from queries and then format them to make it presentable in excel and send it out to whoever needs it. I do a lot of other bullshit that comes into our reporting inbox. Some of these reports take me a few minutes or take me an entire day. Also, these reports are all warehouse shit so nothing to do with financial statements. The closest thing that I do with money is billing clients’ summary bills, provide A/R reports or give an order history that includes the net, freight, tax &amp; total.

You can probably tell what my skillset is. I am really good with vlookups, nested if statements, pivot tables and a bunch of other useless excel formulas. Not surprising since all I’ve been doing is looking at data all day every day since I got this new position. I think the breaking point though was around June. I poked around with macros/VBA and within two months, I have automated nearly half of my reporting schedule. I’ve also created working copies of these spreadsheets that generates summary bills, inventory details &amp; item status reports by simply entering in the account number in a cell reference. When I finished my first working copy that could generate any summary bill by simply entering in the account number, I fell in love with macros/VBA. I am still a beginner in VBA because I taught myself using the record button. If any of you guys look at my code, you guys will think its cancer because its basically a record of what I did in the macro recorder and me throwing in variables, loops and other random codes. I try to make it readable by putting in some comments so that I know what I’m doing in each segment. I’m still learning VBA using that free 10 week course from cal poly tech, this subreddit, google, and other sites.

My manager considers me to be some kind of duct tape that can fix anything and he gives me all of these fucked up accounts/reports to take over since I usually always resolve them. Like, this one summary bill everyone who had it before me were manually marking up the freight based off of a chart on a sheet of paper. You have to realize though that this summary bill occurs every month with hundreds of lines and manually editing 100s of lines every month obviously leads to a shit ton of mistakes. I had the honor of cleaning all of that shit up and figuring out where this extra random $10k was from on the client’s on account balance. I eventually did clean it up and have setup the working copy so that the freight is automatically calculated (was a simple solution.. just needed to do a lookup using TRUE instead of FALSE since the freight markup was based on ranges). After I cleaned all of that shit up, he decides to give me two more accounts recently that are even more fucked up and I’m not even going to get into that because it gives me a headache just thinking about it. Moral of the story, I have a ridiculous schedule and if I were to quit tomorrow, my company would probably need at least two or three people to cover my schedule. That’s how much I’ve taken over the past year and that schedule is still growing. It’s like the macros/VBA have become a double edged sword. I’ve become so much more productive and in response, my manager has dumped all of these fucked up reports to me. I would put through with all of this bullshit if my salary was somewhat competitive but it’s not. When everyone got a 3% raise in the summer, I got bumped up to $16 instead and my manager told me he had to fight for that since that was about a 6% raise and gave me this look as if I should be thankful. I’m pretty sure I make the least in my group even though I have a more difficult schedule than most of them. 

I just want out now. I don’t want to deal with this anymore. I feel as if I am undervalued/underpaid and there is no hope for me career wise since it is a small company. Are there any careers that I can jump into? I’d be interested in any entry level position that uses excel, vba and data but since my experience and knowledge are limited, I am willing to study/earn certificates. However, I really don’t want to do anything with upper levels of calculus so please don’t recommend actuarial sciences.

**TL;DR I’m good with excel and I’ve fallen in love with VBA after I got a glimpse of its potential. What career do you guys recommend? Nothing with advanced calculus please.**

3odky0,1,2015-10-11,Getting a software engineering internship in Robotics,RobotIntern,robotics,https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/3odky0/getting_a_software_engineering_internship_in/,"I'm looking for advice considering where to look, which companies could be looking and possible things I could do to increase my chances at a Software Engineering internship in a Robotics field. I'm currently a junior Computer Science student with no internship experience but a wide variety of robotics projects. However, they're more individual projects rather than the kind of robotics research you'd do with a professor. I'm proficient in Java, C, Common Lisp, Matlab and know a little Python. I've also used Linux/Unix based systems, and generally know my way around ROS. I've applied to ~30 robotics companies (ranging from big companies like Lockheed to multiple startups like Jibo) over the last 2-3 weeks but have only heard from about 2-3 of them, with general responses of ""We don't plan to have interns this summer but..."". At this point I'm open to anything but I'd much prefer to work in a robotics hotspot location. I don't think my resume is the problem considering my robotics professor loved it, so I think it's in the emails that companies request you send your resume through when applying. What are robotics companies generally looking for in the message? I generally explain myself and my skillset in 5-6 lines, but is that not enough?"
3odnex,4,2015-10-11,I think I'm partially dreaming my future,LivingAdventures,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/3odnex/i_think_im_partially_dreaming_my_future/,"So, the past three nights or so, I've had some pretty realistic/vivid dreams.

It started around Thursday night. So last Winter, I had an internship. For reasons beyond my control, they couldn't hire me once it was finished. I've been pretty bitter about it for awhile. Anyway, the dream was that I was working for the company....and resigning. I just kind of ranted about how I got screwed over, etc, etc. Pretty quick, but not extremely vivid. I woke up Friday morning and I just felt much better about life.

Friday Night: Also not too vivd, but real enough. I had a dream that I got a job. I don't even know what the job was. The dream ended with me getting in my car to go to my first day of work.

Last Night: The weirdest. I'm sitting on a my bed, my beautiful wife comes up to me and hands me something. She says ""you look, I'm too nervous."" In my hand is a positive pregnancy test. I'm overjoyed and I think I even excitedly yelled in my sleep. She's in tears of joy, we hug, I wake up. Even when I woke up, I was excited and didn't even feel tired.

Ready for the kicker in all of this? I am unemployed, single, no kids. I've never even had a girlfriend.

Any idea what this sequence of dreams could mean?"

I still remember when I moved to Bay area, looking for a job and starving. Now that I finally have a small full time job (Target IT intern), I would like to help out a little bit to those who need it.

Sadly I am unable to provide a $20 pizza, as I myself haven't had such a filling meal since like ever. What I can help with is a $5 target GC (I got it as part of welcome kit from my boss). This should be good enough to buy you a nice Large pepperoni/cheese frozen pizza.


Rules:

* Please comment below with a reason why you want this.

* Make sure you have a target closeby

* You need to post a picture of Frozen pizza bought from target with your reddit username (e.g. /u/generic_user) written on it within 24 hours of getting the GC.


Sorry for making it strict, just want to make sure it gets into proper hands who need it.

Good luck all!

EDIT: I will choose a winner on Monday 10/12 after work.

EDIT 2 : Winners were chosen and GC were sent. Ended up giving away two GC."
3oedgp,3,2015-10-11,"Discussion/Vent: Met on chatroulette over a year ago, still talking every day",ninety_three93,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/3oedgp/discussionvent_met_on_chatroulette_over_a_year/,"So about 14 months ago I [22M] met someone [21F] on chatroulette. We're both at university, graduating at the end of next year. We had a nice chat for about 30 minutes or so and she gave me her Skype. I never thought anything would come of this: I thought she was pretty and pleasant to talk to, but when I added her on Skype I never thought we'd have anything more than an occasional polite conversation. She lives in Russia, which is literally on the other side of the globe from me; I thought the distance alone would deter both of us from putting in too much effort into being friends. 

For the first month or so it was like this - we would exchange some pretty trivial messages about what we were doing every couple of weeks. I don't know what triggered the escalation exactly but we started talking more and more, for hours at a time, often video calling. We joined each other's social networks (she signed up to Facebook, I signed up to VK, the Russian equivalent) and started following each other's lives outside of our conversations. A few months of this led to us admitting that we had feelings for each other. 

Since then we talk basically every day - not like we sit down and chat for hours, but throughout our days whenever we have idle moments we send each other messages, so we have a continuous conversation going. On weekends we normally have at least one skype call lasting about 2-3 hours. We watch movies together, show each other where we live, and she puts a lot of effort into teaching me Russian. I've even gotten to know her friends quite well because they've all been so amazingly welcoming - I understand their inside jokes and hear about their gossip etc. I have my first care package in the mail for her at the moment (it is almost her birthday) and she apparently has sent me something as well (because why not?). 

So over time, especially recently, we've started to talk more seriously. Neither of us has brought up the idea of a LDR, and I know I wouldn't want one until we had actually met in person at least once. I still see people here, but nothing serious, and I have made it clear that she can do the same thing (though she says she doesn't want to) because I know we're only human and I feel if we start setting rules then there's a high chance of them being broken and whatever we have ending. But we do talk about the future and the possibility of something serious happening. 

Obviously we need to meet. I've told her I'll come to her rather than vice versa for the first meeting at least (she was very grateful about this, not sure if for financial reasons or just because it's a fairly scary thing to do). The problem is when. First of all, being in different hemispheres, we have summer breaks at different times of the year. Secondly, over my summer breaks I've always done a full time internship so I haven't really had enough time to go travelling. Financially it's not a big deal for me but since I'm going so far I'd like to make it a decent trip (about six weeks) even if a part of it is travelling around without her. We've talked about it, and she was really hoping I could come this year, but it looks like the best opportunity is going to be after we graduate university but before we start full time work (the end of next year approximately). She insists if I could come before then she would find a way to work it around her university, but I know that my final year (and her's too I'm sure) will be intense (dissertation etc) and I cannot afford to risk messing it up. 

I know this has been an essay, but I've just needed to tell someone about this whole situation for a long time. I don't really know what I'm hoping to get out of this but if anyone has some advice, or can relate at all it'd be much appreciated. Even just general thoughts on the situation would be great. I really do like this girl, but I'm worried that we're dreaming and nothing is going to come of this. At the same time I'm optimistic that if it's meant to be, it'll happen. 

Some closing points: 

-We don't do anything kinky online, or even talk about that. She implies that it would happen if we were together in person, but says she just doesn't enjoy talking about that kind of thing. I (surprisingly) do not mind this at all and have never tried to steer things this way. 

-I normally HATE txting people about the random shit that I'm doing 24/7. I also never normally skype people unless I have to. But with this girl I always find time for it, and enjoy it a lot. I often completely lose track of time in a skype call and suddenly realise it's been nearly 4 hours and I'm meant to be waking up soon. 

-She talks to her mother about me, who says I'm going to be keeping her waiting forever. Why girls always talk to their mothers about this stuff is beyond me. 

-She talked to someone recently (an acquaintance) who went to live in my country for a few months and met a guy here. They talked for about a year after she left, then met up again and went travelling around Europe. Apparently it was ""awkward"", there was ""culture clash"" and it didn't go well - now they don't talk at all. This upset her (my girl) a lot because she apparently had been really excited to talk about my country and the whole situation with this other girl. She was ""very worried"" that this would happen to us.

3oejsm,1,2015-10-11,To Mechanical Engineers,ElonMusksPotatoes,oilandgasworkers,https://www.reddit.com/r/oilandgasworkers/comments/3oejsm/to_mechanical_engineers/,"I'm a 2nd year Mechanical Engineering student and I want to know what skills and knowledge the industry is in need of so that I can work backwards and cater my learning and experiences towards filling those roles.  
Some questions for you:   




* What do you do?  
Describe your typical day at work.  
  
* What are some books, resources, software, tools, etc that you use in your job on a regular basis.
  
* What are some books or resources that you had to use to learn how to do whatever it is you do?     
  
* What are your personal opinions on the recovery of the oil industry? Do you expect to see some major rehiring in 3-5 years? Also, would this hiring be primarily the experienced engineers who were sacked before or do you expect to see a surge in graduate hires too? 
    

I feel that companies are more likely to hire you if you know exactly what it is you want to do and you have the skills to do it. At the same time I also feel that they might prefer someone they could train and mould to meet their needs?  
For example I know most Mechanical engineers end up become maintainence engineers or working on tool sustainence, does that mean that if I spent my time learning more about drill bits and failure modes that it would increase my chances?  

I just think it's become too competitive to get these highly sought after jobs and a high grade + internships + extracuriculars has just become the basic requirement. I want to be able to have an edge when I graduate and apply. I've set my sights on where I want to be and now it's just a matter of finding out what is needed to get there.

3oem4m,1,2015-10-11,"Update: 3yr long distance breakup - started seeing ex again after 1 month NC despite her new man, and weeks after that guilt has caught up to her. Advice?",LDRtossit,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/3oem4m/update_3yr_long_distance_breakup_started_seeing/,"Greetings again reddit! So awhile back I made a post asking for advice on my situation. You can find that post here &gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/3fph4e/two_weeks_ago_my_gf_26f_of_3yrs_last_two_long/

Tl;dr for that post; Long distance relationship GF of 3yrs (one year together, 2yrs LDR) broke up w/ me weeks before I moved to her location to find a place and move in together. The position she received after her internship would've had us in another LDR, although 1.5hrs away w/ once or so a week visits vs. 14hrs away w/ 4 or so visits/year. She also cited me being in a rut and stagnant in life as a reason, although that was also the reason we decided I should move to her since there are way more opportunities in my field where she is. She was obviously checking out of the relationship, but still was/is very much in love with me (her words) 

Since the last post, my ex did indeed come back to our hometown, and we did meet up while she was here. Previously I had not contacted her. We ended up spending the entire time she was home together having the best sex we've had in the entirety of our relationship (words from her mouth, and my feelings as well) and getting along super well. She told me she still loved me deeply on more than one occasion. 

After the first night, she informed me she was seeing someone new at the remote area she was working. This was not surprising to me, and I assumed it was the case. If we could stray away from non-pertinent infidelity discussion in this that would be great, as I have never had an issue with her seeing other people even when we were together. Her new guy apparently would, but that is a separate discussion on morals that I'm not concerned with getting into. Feel free to PM me hate msgs lol. If she had told me they had hooked up and asked me if it was ok to continue instead of breaking up I would've given her my blessing w/o blinking. 

While together I informed her of my intentions to continue on with my move to her general area as if nothing had ever happened. She seemed very excited about this. I had my flights booked already, and had a pair of backstage passes for a sold out 3-night run of concerts for a band both of us have travelled to see many times in the past happening in her area. The plan originally was to give them to a friend and then use the time in town to find a job/housing, but I ended up giving them to her. We grabbed an air bnb in town, and had an awesome weekend. 

While in town I secured an awesome job, found an amazing place to live, and have successfully gotten myself out of the rut I was in. I'm now firmly planted here, and am thriving for my own sake - not just to please her. Shortly after I became planted, she found out that the place she was interning at was stringing her along, and her position was no longer going to be available. She kindly told them to go fuck themselves, moved away leaving her new guy there (but staying together), found a new place that's much less remote (although still an hour from me and 2hrs from her current guy), and got a new job. This gave me quite a bit of hope, and it seemed like things were finally coming together. 

Two weeks after this she informed me that she doesn't think the two of us should be sleeping together for the time being. She is torn about what to do, and the guilt over cheating on her new guy finally got to her (her words). She is now not sure what to do, and nor am I. New guy is, in my eyes, clearly a rebound/grass is greener/convenience boyfriend. I had a chance to hang out with him for over an hour when I first got to town, and am not threatened by him in the least. I can't foresee their relationship lasting, she just needed the comfort after the breakup. Maybe there's something I'm missing, but myself and all my friends who met him all agreed there is no way it would last.

Lately she has been wanting to hang out more and more, but in a ""we're just really touchy-feely/lovey friends"" way - basically line drawn at passionate kissing and groping. I'm really not sure how to handle this. My first intuition is to tell her that I can't just be her friend, and to re-establish no contact telling her I need to move on. I obviously don't want to move on, but I feel like she needs a push to either dump the guy, tell him the truth about what was/is happening, or decide she likes him enough to stay with him. I can't just keep putting in all this effort to be her backup plan. How should I handle this?

Any advice would be appreciated immensely, thanks in advance kind strangers :)

Tl;dr for this post - Ex and I became intimate again after a 1 month no contact period. She afterwards told me she had a new man. We continued seeing each other and having intimate relations. Later she found out her position at the remote area she works with this guy at fell through, and got a new place/job. Recently the guilt of cheating caught up to her, and she decided we couldn't be intimate until she figures things out. She still wants to hang out in a platonic manner though. How do I handle this?"

At the moment, I'm using a 7 year old laptop until October 26th comes. Would the sp4 (i5, 8gb ram) be sufficient for what I have or should I also get a laptop? If the laptop is not outrageous, I don't mind the cost since I have some extra money from my internship this summer.

What do you guys think? Should I get another sp4 version?"

Here's some details. 

I went to a decent school but I don't think we're winning any awards or anything. Except AICHE outstanding chapter awards but I don't know how hard those are to get. 

Had a shitty GPA. Let's say it was between 2.5 and 2.75. What can I say? I was lazy for a few years, played wow a little too much, and had to work throughout school to support me and my wife. I did however pass the FE first shot. 

Had no co-op experience. See above GPA. 

So for me the job situation was looking a little bleak. I was applying like a madman. Judging from my jobs email folder I applied to somewhere between 800-900 jobs. Got 8 phone interviews of those 8 I got 3 in person interviews. One even called me back in for a 2nd round interview. I didn't get that one though. Out of that I got 2 job offers. One was for an internship in my college town with the prospect of full time employment. I took this one instead of the full time job far away because my wife is still in school and I didn't want to uproot her or have to pay for 2 places. 

So my internship went pretty well. Until they got put on a hiring freeze. Again it felt like the world was falling apart. My internship had a month left and I would be out in the cold again. Back to applying I went. 300 to 400 more applications. 2 interviews. One near my hometown and one a few states away. The one near home made an offer and the other rejected me a mere 4 hours after my interview (yeah fucking harsh). So I accepted this job and I have been loving it. Great people and we have some cool stuff to work with. The job has more mechanical and electrical engineering aspects than chemical but still not bad. 

Now here's the kicker. After I got hired I found out that they weren't going to hire me at first because of my GPA. Apparently they were doing their due diligence and basically interviewing me in the off chance I said something they really liked. And apparently I did. When they asked me what I liked to do in my spare time I mentioned that I liked to work on and build computers and it just so happens they have a lot of aging computers that need or will need upgrading and my boss needed someone who could handle this. 

Also I've been told I interview really well but the only advice I can give is to adopt a mindset of confidence. I just don't get nervous talking to people. I also basically interview the other person the whole time. Turn every question around on them. 

Anyway I just thought I'd like to share my experience with my fellow CHE's and I hope it might offer some hope or encouragement to those seeking jobs. 



tl:dr I got hired because I mentioned in an interview that I build computers. "

Like always any criticism are greatly appreciated. 

~~~

Amber couldn't help but smile when she saw Freddy there.  He had always protected her when ever she was sad or hurt, all she had to was draw the special mark he had taught her.  “Fweddy!”  Her lisp comping out in her excitement to see him sitting on the corner of her bed.  As she got closer to him she could smell the scent he always brought with him, one of fireworks or when a bonfire is just starting. 

The girl ran up to him, taking his hand in hers as she looked at him.  He was smiling down at her, like he always did.  Amber couldn't remember a single time where he wasn't smiling with all his perfectly white teeth shown for all to see.  Even with his long nails she held on tight to his hand never fearing that he might prick her.  

“Tell me little one did you call me for some need?”  Amber shook her head when he asked.  “I was just feeling kinda lonely not seeing you for so long!”  The girl smiled trying to get her grin as large as Freddy's, even if she knew her lips couldn't go that far, still she tried.  

The two of them spoke for some time, Freddy never showing any sign of tiring of the girl's topics of choice, never missing a beat when she would suddenly change topics with no link except in her mind. Time passed and she ran around her small bedroom as the two of them talked.  Eventually the shadows cast from her window started to grow long until finally there was a knock at the door. 

Slowly Amber's mother opened the door to see just what her daughter had been doing all this time. She sniffed at the air, almost smelling something, but not quite sure what it was that she was smelling, just that she could.  “What have you been doing up here all alone?”  Wither her large smile and a proud voice the girl proclaimed the truth to her mother.  “I've been playing with Freddy!”  Amber pointed to where Freddy sat on the side of her bed though her mother never so much as glanced at where he was sitting before replying to Amber.  “Were you having a good time with him?  Because I think it is about time for you to say good bye for now so we can go and have dinner.”  As soon as the words were in the air Amber put on a pout, not wanting to eat dinner instead wanting to continue her play in this room. 

“But mom...”  The girl's voice was small in protest. They all knew how this would end, and yet she was still going through the motions.  She had to after all, it was only right.  As her mother took her hand and lead her out of the room Amber turned back and waved to Freddy, not wanting to leave him there alone.  “How is your imaginary friend doing today?”  Amber's mother asked her as they slowly took each step down the stairs.  No sooner had the question been asked then Amber stopped moving forwards and puffed her cheeks out.  “I keep telling you!  He's not imaginary!  He's just invisible!”  The girl protested before continuing down the stairs with her mother for dinner.

~~

With her hand held by her mother, Amber walked towards her school in the early morning.  Her shoes were damp as she tracked through the dew covered grass.  It wasn't a long walk from her home, though every day it always seemed like an adventure to her, never knowing which way her mother would choose to take.

As they came up to the front of the school Amber's mom let go of her hand, and knelt down giving the young girl a hug and kisses on her cheek.  The woman looked over her daughter once more, straightening the white dress the girl was wearing. “Be a good girl today.” Amber simply smiled a wide smile.

Once this morning ritual was done Amber took off like a shot towards the back of the school where the yard that all the students were expected to congregate before the first bell.  When she got to the back she dropped her pastel coloured Lisa Frank backpack with kissing dolphins fall to the ground, the second bag in the line her class would all fall into when they heard the bell. 

Amber ran off from the various bags, none of them holding any interest for her when instead she could be sure that her best friends were all about to arrive at any moment.  As she ran to the places her friends would normally be playing, she found nothing.  

After her third trip around the yard Amber couldn't help but let out a sigh, now finding it clear that none of her friends, best or otherwise had shown up yet.  Her gaze went to the forest that the school backed onto, it wasn't large and she had played in it a number of times, both on weekends and during school, even if the teacher always told the students they weren't allowed to.  Either way, Amber figured, it was before school even started so she was allowed to.

Amber wondered through the forest, looking for the periodic wild flower.  She sang songs to herself from the various cartoon she would watch in the morning, switching at random between them.  At first she was looking just to find a flower for her best of best friends, then it expanded to all of her best friends, finally to her entire class, all nineteen of them. 

When Amber finally came out of the forest onto the edge of the yard that was now much more lively with the ever growing student population.  Still as she looked at this she was struck with a disquieted sense.  It took her a moment to realize there were scattered torn papers being blown around the yard that had been pristine before.  Looking around she spotted a destroyed backpack, all of its contents that hadn't been strewn across the yard were dumped in a pile, shredded and stomped by small feet.  

At first Amber wondered if wild dogs had been the ones who had done this, but with so many other children so merrily playing still that couldn't have been the case.  As she got closer to the bag laying there she let out a small gasp, surprised by her recognition of the bag, it had been her bag.  The kissing dophins now ripped apart were unmistakeable, she had been the only one in the school lucky enough to have that one, along with the lunch her mom always made her now ground into the dirt under someone's heel. 

Before she could bend down to examine the mess in front of her, Amber heard someone call her name.  The young girl looked up trying to find the source of the voice, she thought it had come from her right, just on the edge of the forest.  With her gaze locked on the edge of the trees she scanned for whomever called her but didn't spot anyone.  

A wet thud impacted the side of Amber's head, quickly followed once more by her name being called. This time though she spotted the source out of the corner of her eye, Colleen, the girl she would tell anyone was her 'bestest of best friends'. 

Slowly amber turned to face the girl, never raising her hand to see what she had been hit with.  The acrid smell and feeling of thick ichor as it slowly oozed down her blonde hair and onto white cotton of her dress.  Amber knew that there could be no mistake as to just what she had been pelted with; dog dirt as her mother would have called it.

As Amber turned to look at her friend she was at a loss for words, her mouth just hanging open.  Her mind was spinning as she tried to make sense of what was happening, why Colleen was standing there with such a self satisfied grin on her lips.

Colleen was talking but Amber couldn't hear any of the words that she was saying.  She just watched her, slowly she realized that there were others there with her, though still they seemed like phantoms she couldn't focus on.  

She felt another impact against her body, this time from a different angle, colliding with her chest,  breaking a number of the flowers she had still been holding.  Everything felt numb in her body as she just stood there watching the world around her move, her feet bolting her there. 

As Colleen along with her 18 phantoms placed her finger on her nose turning it up Amber was finally assaulted with the cavalcade of mocking oinks.  Finally she broke into a run, through the mocking line of children and into the forest. 

Amber simply ran, no idea of where she wanted to go, falling as she went.  Before she knew it one of her shoes was lost, her dress was torn and dirtied, where she could no longer tell the difference between where she had been attacked and where she had fallen.  

After a particular tumble down a hill Amber had the wind knocked out of her.  So instead of running she cried there as she lay flat on her back, the tears flowing over her red face.  Finally after losing all sense time she picked herself up, the tears replaced by a rage that shook her to the core, she tried to steady her hands as she stood there.  

Slowly as Amber walked forwards to a clear patch of dirt, she became aware of the pain from her scrapped up legs and arm.  Picking up a dead branch she scratched the mark Freddy had shown her, calling his name, looking around frantically for her last friend.  When he failed to instantly appear before her she collapsed to the ground, pulling her knees up to her chest and proceeded to cry once more.

A warm hand was placed on the top of Amber's head and she looked up to see him, to see Freddy with his impossibly large grin standing there, his dark eyes looking over her. “You called me, little one?” He asked, saying nothing of her dirty dress and hair, nor her battered arms and legs. “Freddy!” Amber jumped up and wrapped her arm around him. 

It was a long time before she was able to say anything as Freddy stood there, giving the small child as much time as she needed. “Yo- You said you'd do anything for me, right Freddy?” Amber asked as she spoke into his stomach.  Standing there Freddy nodded to her, stroking her dirty hair.  “Of course little one, anything that you ask me to.”

Amber's tiny body shook as she stood there, barely able to stand any more.  “I want you to punish them, Colleen and all the rest who did this to me.”  Freddy stood there, letting out a long sigh as he thought about her request.  “And what would have me do to them?”  His words were slow and exacting as he asked.  “What ever you want!  Send them all to heaven for all I care!”  Amber screamed into him, just wanting the pain she was feeling to stop.  

Gently Amber could feel Freddy's hand on her arms as he loosened her grip on him.  He stepped back, and knelt down so he could be face to face.  “I can do as you ask little one, but you must understand it will take a long time before I can see you again, are you okay with this?”  He watched the girl, as she stood in front of him with her tear stained face.  “Fine!”  Amber screamed at him, simply wanting that sweet vengeance that only her Freddy could give her. 

“Very well my littlest one, I will do as you have asked me.  We will not meet again until I have done as you asked of me.”  Freddy stood and started to walk away from Amber, never looking back as he did.  She started to follow him, wiping the tears away, glancing away from him for only a moment, though long enough for him to disappear. 

Amber didn't call out for Freddy, he had disappeared like this before, and calling him again never worked, even drawing the image he had taught her wouldn't work, she was alone now. 

Now she could only wander, lost in a daze, through this small forest.  It was some time before one of the school's teachers found her, still looking for that lost shoe. Amber was shocked at the reaction, someone had started a rumour about a cougar attacking one of the students and dragging the poor child off. 

~~

After a week of staying home Amber finally returned to school, though nothing that Freddy had promised to do for her had come to pass, she still hadn't seen him, even after calling him each night after her parents had tucked her in to bed he hadn't appeared like he promised he always would. 

In time Freddy slowly faded from Amber's mind, he had always just been an invisible friend to her, not real like those in her class that had terrorized her that day, in some play to take her down a few pegs, but still from time to time she would still try to summon her friend throughout the rest of the year, only stopping when her mother one day told her that her father had been given a new job and that the family was going to be moving once her school year was over. 

~~

With a light drizzle taking over the city Amber absentmindedly store out of the office window ignoring the pile of forms she had to complete for work.  This job had been nothing like what she had expected, instead of the exciting and dynamic environment with new challenges it was just her filling out the same four forms each day, pushing them along so they could be stamped. 

Her hand was doodling some just what ever it felt like as she listened to the radio playing in the office, they'd cut off the music to talk about a train accident, from everything that was being said it sounded to her like it was something of a miracle, the train had been nearly empty when it derailed, so far only three people had lost their lives: an attendant, a passenger, and some poor person who had been stopped  at a railway crossing. 

A pair of feet stopped by her desk as continued to stare out the window. “Just leave them on the desk.” Amber said, never bothering to even look at the person who had come up to her desk. She knew who it was, just some intern with a new stack of forms that needed to be filled out, that was the only reason anyone ever came up to her desk. 

“It has been a long time... little one.”  The man standing by her desk said.  At first Amber simply raised an eyebrow as he spoke to her, not quite sure just who this guy thought he was to speak to her like that, though something in a long forgotten part of her soul screamed at her to remember.  

Finally she looked at him, and her voice was stricken from her.  The man that was standing there was a horror to behold. The first thing she saw was his long gaunt fingers that continued on long past where she thought they should have ended, in a razor's point ready to render any flesh that he could choose.  His face was worse.  When she was a child she thought was a smile was a lack of any lips, exposing his teeth from ear to ear, while the dark comforting eyes were impossibly dark sockets that just sat there, she felt like they were peering into her soul. 

“It has been so long, little one.”  Amber glanced around wondering just how her coworkers would be reacting to him, but there was nothing, none of them even seemed to notice the three metre horror that she had once thought looked so handsome.  “Fweddy?”  The name came flooding back to Amber as she gasped it out, the lisp reappearing after so many years of being locked away. 

“I am glad that you still remember me, and had the foresight to call me on this most glorious of days.”  Amber was dumb struck by what he was saying, she hadn't called him and there was nothing to make this day glorious unless you liked some light rain.  “What, just what do you mean by that?”  Amber asked, doing her best to keep her voice down and gaze locked on the space where Freddy's eyes should have been.  “Has it been so long little one that you have forgotten what you asked me to do for you?” Freddy asked, tilting his head, now looking to have a grotesque smile.

Amber felt the bottom of her stomach drop as he spoke, but she had to be sure.  “Just what did I ask you to do?”  Her heart leaped into ears, seeming to try and match the movements of her stomach as she waited for his answer.  “Why I have simply sent them to be in as close a place to heaven as I can get them.”  The words were flat as he said them, but all the same it make Amber want to vomit.  “How... how many?”  She asked, her gaze falling to the floor not quite able to believe what she was hearing. 

She just continued to stare at the floor not quite able to process what Freddy had told her.  When a gentle hand was placed on her shoulder she jumped back trying to get out of her chair, but instead falling over it, hitting the ground hard, barely missing the sharp edge of a filing cabinet.  She looked up to the person that had touched her and a surprised face was looking back at her.  Ed Barr stood there, a look of shock on his face.  “A-are you alright?”  He managed to stammer out as Amber pulled herself up.  

“I... I'm sorry I need to take the rest of the day off.”  Amber practically yelled out as she tried her best to escape the office. In her hands she fumbled with her phone, she had to know if what Freddy had told her was real, if she had killed them, nineteen people from her elementary school, could that really be.  No, it had to be all crazy talk, something like that simply couldn't have happened. 

Slowly though call after call, and having to say the dreaded line “I'm so sorry for you loss.” Only three names from her second grade class remained, unable to reach anyone who knew those three. So Amber waited, glued to the T.V. fearing what Freddy had said applied to those people who had lost their lives from that derailment.

Near morning a break on one of the channels, a victims name had been leaked, the attendant on the train “Colleen Rose.” Amber repeated back to herself, unable to believe it. 

She wanted to call him, to call Freddy to tell him it had all been wrong, a child's anger that burned so hot though for only an instant, that she wanted him to undo it all.

Just two names left she thought to herself. There was one other question that she had to ask her self even if she was trying to avoid it, the one thing that she knew needed to be asked ever since she saw Freddy for the first time.

Can God even forgive me?"

3ofcg6,0,2015-10-12,"This will get buried, but I [18 M] just really need to talk about how to NGAF about telling ex girlfriend [18 F] that I like her again.",breated,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3ofcg6/this_will_get_buried_but_i_18_m_just_really_need/,"Okay. I'll try to avoid making this a wall of text. I was debating writing this but I just need to ask someone because my roommates just don't give me good advice.

When I was a junior in high school, I started seeing this girl that I worked with. We had a pretty good relationship, she just lived really far and we went to different schools and even though the time I was with her was nice, I just felt distanced from her and I was about to leave for a long internship in France and we had only been seeing each other for a month or two so I ended it- this was near the end of junior year, I think late April or early May. 

It was rough and I could tell that it just destroyed her (I felt really bad too) and even though we stayed in contact, we just had different lives and generally didn't talk to each other much. She came over to my house every once in a while late at night and we would have sex and then she would go home. I always felt sleep deprived and guilty the next day, I think she may have too. I've always felt terrible about the way that the relationship went.

I started freshman college, and I found out that she goes to the same school as me. Not only that, but we have a class together. I was so nervous and planned on not talking to her because I just felt guilty and didn't want to make the situation even worse, but she was incredibly nice and took some initiative and we hung out and visited each other's rooms. That weekend, we both got drunk and had sex and the next day I felt terrible again and we decided to get plan B. 

However, for some reason, the next day it felt like things were back to normal. We continued talking and even went hiking together a few days later. We would talk every once in a while and get along amazingly (a few times a week), we even did a few things (saw a few movies, stayed up until midnight talking in a field, etc) up until a week ago when she texted me to meet with her because she was sad and didn't wanna do her homework alone. I hung out with her in a library and then we snuck onto a rooftop downtown and talked until 1 in the morning. We even reminisced on all of these stories from our first go at a relationship and got mad nostalgic. The next day we went on a drive. We've been talking a lot more, and last night we even took a bus an hour away to the capitol of the state (in a college town) until 3 in the morning. I spent all day with her today doing homework. 

We've both talked at length with each other about how neither of us really fits in the college and how we don't really have friends there. I've told her many times that I feel like she's the only person that I can really talk to here and she's felt the same way. In the year and a half since I really talked to her, she has grown up so much and I feel so connected with her now. I really like her a lot. I like how rational and intelligent she is as a person, I think she has such an awesome sense of humor and can totally handle my sarcasm, and I just want to spend all my time with her. I just feel like I'm making compromises talking to everyone else at this school because I just haven't found people that I feel really comfortable talking to and with her I feel like I'm just being completely honest.

There have been multiple points where we're saying goodbye and we kind of stand there for a second and it feels a bit drawn out, and then she goes inside and moments like that I feel like telling her, or kissing her, but even though I feel like I've been giving relative signs (texting stuff like I'm glad we have class together, sitting close to her when we're together and really listening to everything she has to say because I'm interested), she hasn't been completely reciprocating all of them (she has a bit, texting me stuff like ""you make me feel better when I talk to you"" or taking these long trips with me late at night and really talking to me/making an effort to hang out), and I honestly can't tell if she is trying to make a close personal friendship here or if she feels the same way, so I just say goodnight and go home. I don't know if I'm over analyzing that.

Damn, sorry for going so middle school on this shit, she's just always on my mind and it's eating away at me and my close personal friends are all at different schools, and my roommates aren't even worth talking about this stuff with, but I HAVE to ask SOMEONE. I have ZERO idea what to do. I want to really get something started with her but I also don't want to have misinterpreted the situation and ruin a really good friendship, because as I said, I think we are really at a different point in our lives and I think we really get each other.

Sorry for the long post! Thanks for anyone who took the time to read this- I just don't want this kind of thing to go on too long and have it be cemented as a friend thing.

TLDR; Ex Girlfriend and I had an unhealthy break up, a few years late are now living at the same college and are really helping each other/understanding each other far more than anything else, and feels like a completely different dynamic. I like her and I'm not sure if we are doing a close friend thing or not and I want to know how to maybe NGAF about talking to this girl about how I feel! 

*ring the ""this shit is so damn middle school I can't even stand it bell*

This will get buried, but I [18 M] just really need to talk about how to NGAF about telling ex girlfriend [18 F] that I like her again."

3oh2fc,1,2015-10-12,"I have the responsibilities of three full time jobs, but am only being payed for one. Was promised a raise in Spring, that never came.. What do I do?",RenaissanceGraffiti,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3oh2fc/i_have_the_responsibilities_of_three_full_time/,"Here's a bit of context. First off, I'm 24, and before this, I was a full time tour guide, and trying to make ends meet was proving to be more challenging than it was worth with that job. So I began to get my career in the arts up and going and decided to apply for an internship position in a pretty prestigious post-production studio, hoping to get a foot in the door in the recording industry as a voice over talent. 3 months into my internship, I was offered a full time position at the studio, where I'm expected to finesse the Client Services, spearhed the Internship Program, and facilitate the flow of the studio (i.e, make sure things are working properly). 

What's great about this is that this position was a HUGE ""promotion"" from my previous one as tour guide, (in terms of responsibilities). And my previous job before THAT as a busser. It's also my first salaried job. So I consider this progress.

The life goal is to own a production company, so I consider this new position as an opportunity to work out the kinks of managing people and juggling lots of things at once.

But you see, essentially I'm expected to wear three full-time hats. Which is to be expected in the production industry. I assume.

I asked a business mentor of mine what I should do when going in to negotiate my salary. I was told to ask for a job descriptions for all three primary responsibilities, or, at the very least, write my own job descriptions, calculate the time per week needed to complete it, compare average salaries for each respective job, and calculate the average of all three to get a rough number. Then I was told to ""high-ball"" that number, and then negotiate with my new employer to reach a more middle ground. Something like that.

So the number that I came up with hovered anywhere between 35k- 50k a year.

Well the meeting happened, and I must admit that I was taken aback when he offered $27.5k. 

Weighing my age, my inexperience in the field and industry, and considering my apparent naivete, I agreed to it. It was a risk, but I considered the learning opportunity and the development experience as more valuable in the long-run than a yearly salary.

I was hired in November 2014, and was essentially ""promised"" a small raise the following Spring. Well Spring happened, then Summer, and now Fall, and still nothing. This whole year, my boss has made it pretty clear to everyone here that the company is ""poor"" and that this is the ""slowest we've been in 20 years"" and that they're worried about making payroll every month.

Hearing this puts me on edge, because not only does this mean I shouldn't expect my raise anytime soon, but it also makes me worried about job security. Because if it came down to it, and money was tight enough, I can expect to be the first one to be let go, no matter how hard I work or how good I do, since my position isn't as ""vital"" as a say an Executive Producer, or even front desk, receptionist.

so I've spoken with my boss about taking on more ""sales"" or ""producing"" responsibilities, since the amount of money the company makes directly effects my position in the studio, but nothing has come from that.

I come to this subreddit to seek a bit of anonymous guidance. I don't know when to begin asking some of these difficult questions about pay. If we're so poor, should I be looking for another job? If so, it's important to me that it's somewhat involved in the industry that I want a career in, so I'm not sure what my options are in that. I have a whole new set of skills to employ that I don't even know what other job to seek if it comes down to it. I don't ever want to work in a restaurant again. ever again. ever.

I appreciate your halp ahead of time.

3ohhks,94,2015-10-12,Lithium Being Used In Airborne Spraying Over Oregon,[deleted],conspiracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3ohhks/lithium_being_used_in_airborne_spraying_over/,"In January 2015, I began receiving reports by email, telephone and over Facebook of very specific symptoms from very specific locations under very specific spraying activity throughout Oregon. From my experience as a counselor, having had to do an internship for drug rehabilitation many long years ago, I instantly recognized that the symptoms were being caused, almost certainly, by lithium intake. How could so many people be suddenly dosed up on lithium? 

And then it hit here in Reedsport, a tiny town on the central coast of Oregon. I had no more doubt. I posted my findings on the various FB pages.In direct response to these posts, the first letter from the whistle blower arrived on January 30, 2015. I at first thought it was another letter of complaint from someone who thought I had the solution to the horrors of Geoengineering. Instead, the letter is the real thing.For six months, I respected the danger this person, who uses the pseudonym Locke, was putting himself in and I was very discreet about who saw the letter. And I was very discreet in putting messages on the FB sites to confirm to Locke that I was working on his message. I used the letter as a teaching tool and it was very effective. Either readers were completely convinced of what is happening in Oregon or they went into horrified denial. The Geoengineering activists to whom I sent the letter almost always dismissed it, ignored it or immediately responded that they couldn’t do anything about it. This was very disappointing until I realized that the atrocity of Geoengineering, and these experiments, is on such a vast scale that each of us is struggling to fight in our own corner with very little mutual support.That being said, I finally sent the letter to Elana Freeland (author of Chemtrails, HAARP and the Full Spectrum Dominance of Planet Earth). She pointed out that despite Locke’s fears for his family, he is desperate to get the information out to the media, social media and beyond. So shall it be.

A second letter has surfaced, which I will quote from. It was received by HH in Medford around the first of March. Locke expresses his disappointment that the activists he had contacted never responded. Having had essentially the same non-response, I understand his frustration. So, after much research to back up Locke’s disclosures, here is the pertinent information from the whistle blower. His private information will remain private.We can deduce from his excellent use of English and from his job description, that he is well educated in a science field, probably a DSc or PhD, he is most likely in his late 30’s or early 40’s, and is equally at home outdoors as in a lab. His use of the name Locke indicates he knows American history. The original John Locke created the concept of the social contract and whole portions of his writings were copied into the US Constitution. Our Locke lives in central Oregon but travels the state extensively. He enjoyed his work up until it was subsumed for what he is describing.Excerpt from Locke’s first letter:“For example, I could have warned thousands of people of the ongoing (as of January 27th) spraying to manufacture air stagnation in the Rogue and Umpqua Valleys, as well as much of the Oregon Coast south of Florence. The artificially induced period of air stagnation is part of a larger experiment testing the efficacy of psychoactive chemical dispersal from high altitudes.

 Currently, spraying is most intense along the coast itself and above inland valleys. The stagnant air currents in the region allow for more direct application of psychoactive agents to test populations. I have little formal contact with the chemistry department, but to my knowledge, Lithium is the primary substance being dispersed in the aforementioned experiment. Given the psychoactive/social nature of the ongoing tests, my department is playing a secondary role collecting water and soil samples. The Sociological Research Division however, has operatives throughout the region gathering a massive amount of data regarding the test population’s behavioral traits, like consumer habits, political engagement levels, and awareness of geoengineering programs. I would urge you to inform your friends and peers of this fact, as avoiding observation by refusing to take surveys and engaging in similar actions that can disrupt this sordid research. “Excerpt from Locke’s second letter:“These dispersal plumes contain lithium and other psychoactive compounds. The areas targeted as of March 1st are inland valleys and coastal towns south of Florence. Over the next two months, additional spraying operations will be conducted to increase targeting areas in the Portland metropolitan area.”In both letters, he explains that he is …”an employee of a weather data collection company and, by proxy, a subcontractor for the National Weather Service office in (central Oregon).

 In my work for the aforementioned institutions, I collected data, e.g. soil samples, that were used to direct spraying operations for the last three years.”He sent these letters because of his own family crises which …. “made me recognize the inherent evil of using human beings and the natural environment as a laboratory. Ethical considerations should never be disregarded. Unfortunately at my workplace, they routinely are.”What he says is part of the picture of what is happening on a global scale: a complete absence of morality. Without compunction, these experimenters are capable of killing subjects with side effects or by doing an LD (lethal dose experiment).So here are the facts: For three years, up until July 2015 the small towns on the south coast of Oregon: Reedsport, Bandon, Brookings as well as the Klamath Basin and Rogue Valley’s small towns are being used to test lithium and psychoactive compounds on a regular schedule and have been used for such for the last three years. Soil samples are taken and social interviews carried out, and one can assume, medical records which are now computerized, are monitored.In July 2015 I began receiving reports from observers of symptoms other than from psychoactive compounds. The symptoms indicate an application of a pathogen (disease) component most likely correlated with the use of certain electromagnetic frequencies. 

This has happened before during the last three years when a round of severe diarrhea was reported, almost entirely in women and female dogs (October – November, 2014).As of this month, September 2015, another step in this program of direct experimentation has occurred. Up until now, they have had to manufacture a weather inversion or stagnant air inversion to apply the lithium and psychoactive materials directly onto one spot. I noticed the new method of holding the lithium haze cloud in place first over the area in northern California where the massive fires have hit. Elana Freeland wondered if the multiple fine chemtrail lines were of aluminum or some other conductive metal that could interact with the lithium for military communications (C4 -command, control, communication, cyber warfare).At first I didn’t realize what I was seeing: hundreds of thin chemtrails throughout a lithium haze. Despite fairly high winds, the haze, with newly applied daily lines, stayed in one spot for daysOn Monday, September 21st, directly over Reedsport, my town, there was a little square cloud that had been placed there from a storm system up in Idaho. Despite offshore winds and the usual breeze along the Umpqua River valley, that square cloud stayed in place all day like a message seeking recognition.The next day, Tuesday, September 22nd, which is when I travel to the Coos Bay / North Bend, Oregon area to teach Tai Chi, the Geoengineers hit full bore soaking the area in lithium and some sort of psychoactive compound.

 Let me explain that I had considered this kind of action to be nearly impossible because of the terraine of this area. It is wide open with vast bays and rivers and the ocean to the west, and always strong offshore winds every afternoon. Yet, here was an obvious haze application directly and very low over the entire area and it was holding in place. I wasn’t the only person experiencing vicious and intense symptoms.When I got home, I caught the radar image. It was exactly the same technique as was used over the fire zone in northern California. Elana Freeland (author of Chemtrails, Haarp and the Total Spectrum Dominance of Planet Earth) wondered if the multiple fine chemtrail lines of aluminum or some other conductive metal interacting with the lithium for military communications (C4 – command, control, communications, cyber warfare).By that evening, I was receiving FB messages from Eugene, Portland and Vancouver,BC of cases of severe chest congestion, coughing, sinus pain, headaches, extreme muscle pain, lethagy. 

Reports were also coming in of crazy behavior and wild driving.Locke was right. The experiment over the small towns in Oregon seems to have been successful and is now being used all along the west coast of the U.S. Without a doubt the rest of the world will experience the use of this technique very soon.This is far more than global weather manipulation. The only reason such experimentation can happen without massive uprisings is because of the thorough disinformation campaign and behavior programming we are subjected to. Anyone in the public health field should instantly see that the patterns of these symptoms have no correlation to any known disease vector.Hopefully this article will be the stimulus to investigate and take action.Lithium (Li) is the softest of all metals and is an alkali metal. It is relatively inexpensive to mine as it is fairly common. Lithium, refined, is highly reactive and flammable. Lithium will ignite and burn in oxygen when exposed to water or water vapors. It is HIGHLY conductive of both heat and electricity, which is why it is used in batteries. This is why it is now being widely used in geoengineering, to increase electric conductivity, as a dessicant (drying agent) and to increase volatility in forest fires. Without any regard as to its extreme toxicity to living creatures. https://enwikipedia.org/wiki/lithiumFirst and foremost, lithium is an FDA PREGNANCY CATEGORY D drug which means, even in very small doses, it causes birth defects, most especially of the heart. Lithium also passes through breastmilk and will harm the baby.

Although the many websites which list the uses and warnings of lithium as a drug often divide the symptoms into COMMON SIDE EFFECTS and DANGEROUS SIDE EFFECTS, these effects are only gradations. The toxic dosage is small and each person is affected differently. For some individuals, even the smallest dose of lithium as a drug can be highly debilitating and some people react allergically. THERE IS NO ANTIDOTE FOR LITHIUM OVERDOSE OR ALLERGIC REACTION.Here are all the side effects listed at once:First and foremost – LETHARGY. You feel heavy and drugged.• THIRST. You can become quickly dehydrated especially if overheated. You crave salt.• STOMACH DISTRESS including both diarrhea and constipation.• TWITCHING of hands and head, sometimes of the whole body.• LOSS OF appetite. You can’t taste your food.• SLURRED SPEECH and BLURRED VISION.• ‘IMITATION’ GOITRE. Looks like thyroid malfunction but isn’t.• ENDROCRINE DISRUPTION CAUSING SEVERE MENSES/PERIODS. Stomach swells up as if you’re pregnant.• KIDNEY PAIN as the renal glands become dysfunctional.Here are just two links to the symptoms of Lithium as a drug. There are many, many more ( via thelibertybeacon.com )."
3oi7g2,0,2015-10-12,Do I have a chance of winning if I fight a parking ticket in court?,juicerbox,FortCollins,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortCollins/comments/3oi7g2/do_i_have_a_chance_of_winning_if_i_fight_a/,"I'll try to make this story somewhat short.

Here goes.

Like everyone and their mother, I just moved here from Arizona. I've got a master's degree in mass communication and I'm looking for a job. In the meantime, I'm starting a blog about Fort Collins nerd culture with the excellent people who made Fort Collins Comic Con happen. So I went to the old town library to work on that for a few hours on Wednesday two weeks ago. I got out to my car and I had a parking ticket for $75. I hadn't parked incorrectly or in the wrong area—I had outdated tags. Some time in the last week someone had (partially) peeled the tags off my vehicle. However, you could still see part of the new tags covering up the old '09 tag. The new ones were pretty clearly visible (the year wasn't visible but you could tell that there were newer tags on top). Point is, I had updated registration. 

I really wished they had just given me a warning or something since I clearly didn't peel off my own tags. Anyways, I go to the court building intending to fight the $75 ticket. However, the clerk lowers it to $25. If I fought the ticket and won, there would still likely be a $35 court fee. So it was in my best interest to pay the $25, which I did.  

The clerk told me not to park anywhere public until I get my new tags in the mail. Fine. Except for the fact that I got an internship in downtown Fort Collins about a week later. There is literally no private parking in that area that I know of (I did just move here so if you know of any let me know). So I waited for my tags to arrive in the mail (I ordered them the day after I got my parking violation but because they are from Arizona I had to wait for my parents to get them and remail them to me.) My internship started last Wednesday. I figured that if I parked in the garage on Lemay and paid money for parking they would be less likely to ticket me. I did that on Wednesday, backing my car in just in case, and it worked. No ticket. But today I got back to my car at the end of the internship day and there was yet another $75 ticket on my car. The tags will most likely arrive this evening or tomorrow. If they had just arrived in the mail on Saturday, I would have been fine. But that's not how the world works.

So I went to the courthouse and asked if they would reduce the $75 ticket to $25 again. Clerk said no way. Second ""offense"" is $75. So I decided to take it on in court. If I lose, I pay $110. If I win, I pay $35. I work a minimum wage job while my boyfriend goes to school. I'm trying to find real work but I've only been here two months and it takes time even when you've interned at National Geographic and earned your master's degree by age 21. 

I'm trying to better myself with an internship and with this blog. I'm trying so damn hard. But it feels like the City of Fort Collins keeps kicking me down. It's not my fault that someone stole the tags off my car. I can't control that. I had to park downtown for my internship. It's not my fault there's no private parking in that area.

I can't afford $75. That's two weeks of groceries for me and boyfriend. If we pay that we will literally starve. 

Do you think the city is going to care? Will they listen to my case and maybe (just maybe) consider mercy? Or am i screwed?

Sorry this was so long! Thanks for reading!"

**Notable Box Office Stories:**

* Ridley Scott and Matt Damon are back. The Martian’s good word of mouth and high critical praise kept the film at #1 this weekend, dropping a mere 31.9% from its opening weekend. This strong hold on the box office represents the lowest week-to-week drop in the last five movies directed by Ridley Scott (66.4%, 56.9%, 59.4%, 48%, 47%) or starring Matt Damon* (54.1%, 68.5%, 37.3%, 45.2%, 40.2%), respectively. The Martian’s staying power was also aided by weak openings for Pan ($15.3 million) and The Walk ($3.7 million). Look for next week’s wide release of adult minded fare Steve Jobs and Bridge of Spies to make a dent in The Martian’s audience.

* Sony’s Hotel Transylvania 2 continues to tap the children’s market with excellent word of mouth, only dropping 38.5% between its second and third weekend. This box office win is helping offset Sony/TriStar’s disastrous opening for The Walk (opening this weekend). Look for Sony’s very own family friendly Goosebumps to take some of this audience.

* Warner Bros.’ $150 million production of Pan bombs into third place with a paltry opening of $15.3 million. The Joe Wright directed, Hugh Jackman and Rooney Mara starring drama was planned as the origin story for a franchise. Unfortunately, the lack of audience turnout and critical condemnation (Metacritic: 35%, Rotten Tomatoes: 25%, Cinemascore: B+) means this is a one and done for the studio. Look for the studio to rely on foreign audiences to make up the slack, as they did with Jupiter Ascending ($18.3 million opening weekend, $181.8 million worldwide cume).

* Warner Bros.’ The Intern stays in 3,224 theaters at #4 with a 25.7% drop this weekend (smaller than the 34.1% drop from it’s opening-to-second weekend). As stated last week,  Nancy Meyers is a brand unto herself and her films have a great track record of posting strong multiples from their opening weekends. We’ll keep an eye on this one to see how it finishes, but with minimal drops and a domestic cume of $49,592,234 we expect this to finish near $100 million domestic.

* Sony/TriStar’s The Walk is this week’s notable wide release, expanding from 443 Imax theaters to 2,509 screens. The Robert Zemeckis directed, Joseph Gordon-Levitt starring picture severely disappointed this weekend, opening at #11 with $3,719,177. This is the lowest domestic opening for Robert Zemeckis and while it was made on a budget of $35 million, this is still wildly below studio expectations. Sony’s decision to rollout this film via Imax seems to have played a role in why audiences aren’t connecting, despite high critical praise (Metacritic: 70, Rotten Tomatoes: 86%, Cinemascore: N/A).

* Universal's Steve Jobs opened in four theaters in New York and Los Angeles to a stunning $130,236 average per screen, for a grand total of $520,942. This is the year's highest average per screen opening weekend for a limited release, and the 15th highest of all time. For comparison, last year's American Sniper (11th of all time) opened with an average of $158,364 for a total of $633,456 and Moonrise Kingdom (14th of all time) opened with an average of $130,749 for a total of $521,522. Look for this to exceed box office expectations as critics love it (Metacritic: 82, Rotten Tomatoes: 87%, Cinemascore: N/A) and Universal is the studio that can do no wrong (Jurassic World, Furious 7, Minions, 50 Shades of Grey, Straight Outta Compton, etc.).

*Does not include ensembles Interstellar, The Monuments Men or Contagion.

I am no longer happy, and I don't think she is either.",pellojudding,Divorce,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/3oiv5h/have_i_31m_done_all_i_that_i_could_to_save_my/,"We met in college and fell in love. We were both athletes, both great students, etc. The big difference from close to the beginning of the relationship was sex. We probably had sex 2x/week for the first year of the relationship. Over the years that dwindled.

We fought like normal couples fight...not more, not less (at least compared to my friends). Once we graduated we moved back in with our parents. We both had small houses with a lot of siblings. Sex, needless to say, went down. I didn't expect her at 23-24 years old to be having sex in the back of the car...but she always said she wasn't comfortable having sex in either of our houses when people were home. I understood. However, when I would suggest going to a nice hotel for the weekend she always said it was a ""trashy"" thing to do. So we didn't...and the sex was down. She said when we moved in together sex would be normal.

I proposed to her 4 years after we started dating and we got married and moved in together. She worked two jobs during that time (one a paid internship, one a full-time job, so she was essentially at 80 hours/week). We saw each other at night and on Saturdays. She was always extremely stressed out because of all the hours she was working. I told her to quit her non-internship job (it was not for her career) because we did not need the money. I made enough money to support myself and her with her paid internship. We are married at this point, so it should not have been an issue. She continued to work 80 hours/week. This cause tension. She was always irritable. Obviously, most people who are exhausted and work 80 hours/week are not going to want to have sex if they already don't really like doing it anyways. And we didn't. Sex was a chore when we had it...and I had to pretty much nag for it.

Things got to a point where she was moody, criticized most things I did (cleaning, etc., mind you, when she wasn't the best cleaner in the world). I told her I thought that we should see a marriage counselor. She said that's a complete waste of money and she refused to see one. I also forgot...I earlier asked her if she would see a doctor due to the low libido issue and she said that she's ""not going to see a fucking doctor to tell her that she doesn't have a sex drive.""

I told her I wanted a divorce since things were not working out. She broke down and apologized for everything. She said she was sorry for how things had been, that she was tressed, etc from the two jobs (remember, she didn't need the second job).

Things were fine for 6 months. I applied for different jobs online and got a call from one 2500 miles away. It was a great opportunity for me, paid me more, etc. She was 100% on board, was excited about it, etc.

So we move across the country. I have a brand new job working 60 hours/week (at least for the first 6 months, which she knew would happen). Every single day I came home from work she complained about how she couldn't find a job and that she was lonely with no friends. I told her she would eventually find a job. I also told her to maybe join a gym or do something during the day, even part-time, to get her mind off things. She refused.

So then started working for the company she worked at back home (Nordstrom). She met new people, etc. and loved it. Things were good again.

She ends up getting a job in her field, 50-60 hours/week. But here we go again, she doesn't want to leave her job at Nordstrom. She cut her hours down to 15 hours/week...but now she's working 75 hours/week again. Always tired. Always irritable. Never wants to have sex, rarely wants to go out because she's tired.

So here we are at 31. She works all week, then works a full day on the weekend. She is completely exhausted. She also wants to go to bed at 9pm every single night because she's tired. I'm not 21...I don't need to stay up until 4am and go out drinking. But I also don't want to be laying in bed at 9pm on a Saturday night because my wife wants to wake up at 7am on a Sunday to work for a company that will not help her career. I have asked her to quit that job and she has refused each time.

In her defense, she came from a ""high-pressure"" family (for lack of a better phrase. You were always expected to have a job and always be working. If not, you were considered lazy. Her father is a huge alcoholic and was verbally abusive to her and her family growing up. Her mother worked for the same company for 30 years and anything my wife did growing up was never good enough. Ever.

For years I felt bad for her because of the family part of her life. They all put each other down and guilt trip each other. When they get in fights, they don't speak to each other for MONTHS at a time. Some of her immediate family hasn't spoken for over a year. My wife has also done that silent treatment to me for weeks at at time when she doesn't ""approve"" of something that I do. After that time is up she will say ""well I think you know I had nothing to say to you for two weeks because you made a rude comment to me.""

I'm not perfect. Do I sometimes not clean the bathroom perfectly? Yes. Could I clean the counters more? Yes. But you know what? I go to work everyday for 10-11 hours, workout during lunch so that I stay in shape for my wife (and my health), I do chores around the house (laundry, dishes, etc, duties we split). 

I love my wife, treat her with respect, and try to make her happy. She's obviously not happy, and I'm not happy anymore either. I feel guilty to a degree because I felt like this a few years ago and could've ended it when she was in her 20s. I know it's harder for a woman to find a man when she is 31 years old. Part of me feels like I robbed her if I leave, but at the same time, I wanted to try to work it out.

She won't see a relationship counselor like I mentioned earlier and refuses to change. She continues to give me silent treatment when things don't go her way. Hell, even if I do say something I shouldn't (not a threat or anything like that, just something in the heat of an argument), do I really deserve to be ignored for two weeks?

Is there any chance for this? Should I spend anymore time trying? Or is this thing over?

Thanks in advance. I really need help on this one.

Edit: Two more things:

1) With cleaning: I suggested that we get a cleaning person to do a deep clean once/month. That way it would free up 8 hours/month of us being able to do things we wanted to do. This didn't mean we would stop doing dishes, picking up after ourselves, etc. This just meant we would get a little bit of relief and be able to spend the time on each other. Her response? ""We're not rich and we're not lazy, we can clean our own house.""

2) Cooking: She does not cook. She's a vegetarian and eats salads and other small veggie meals. I don't expect her to cook for me, this is not the 60s and I know she works. But when I don't get home from work until 7:30pm, I don't want to cook all the time during the week. When I pick something up, she says I'm wasting money. It's not 7 days/week, it's 2-3 days/week. Could I sit home on Sunday and cook 5 meals for the week? I suppose. But that's really not what I want to be doing on a Sunday in my free time. If I can get a $10.00 dinner during the week somewhere that saves me 30 minutes of cooking, yes...I would prefer to do that.

Should I give up?",CuriousMaster303,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/3oiw5a/ms_accounting_student_who_didnt_get_a_single_1st/,"Here is what my resume looks like:
http://imgur.com/36o2dkM

I used my schools OCR and applied to all the big 4 and about 10 middle market firms like (McGladrey, BDO.....) for internship positions for summer 2016.

All the results are in, and each and everyone has said no to a first round interview.

I networked extensively at the events these firms held at my school, I got their business cards and sent good follow up emails. 

I even hosted an event through my BAP accounting fraternity and networked myself in a professional manner.

I have 1.5 years of schooling left after this semester, its going to cost me 30k total for this masters. 

I know how important internships are for getting a chance to work after you graduate. If I don't have the relevant experience, you can reasonably expect you won't be getting a job at least at the big 4 or any middle market firms.

Honestly I'm very disappointed, I put lots of effort to get to this point, I was more financed focus but eventually grew to really enjoy accounting as a subject, and not just a means to a stable job. 

However, not even getting 1st round interviews, should I just give up and stop myself from wasting all this money?

Maybe there is something wrong with me, or I'm just really unlucky."

I wasn't sure where to go with this question so I came here-- if there's a better place let me know!

This weekend I attended a conference for my very specific career path. I was surrounded by the top people in this business from all over the country. I'm graduating college in 2 months and this was my only opportunity to meet the people I've applied for jobs with or will be soon. I prepared as best as I could-- got business cards, dressed professionally, met with career services, etc. However, I was attending the conference with a male friend and during the conference we became friends with other college-aged men who have similar goals. 

Every time we met someone in the industry, these men wouldn't let me speak. I would try to talk, and they'd finish my sentence or simply talk over me. One guy, who I'm actually friends with, would immediately change this subject any time I brought up an accomplishment that I have and he hadn't. He would downplay what I've accomplished to an extreme measure from the start of our conversations, and I could tell it made people assume I wasn't very smart or successful. After that point, if I made any sort of insightful comment (if I could get a word in) people looked shocked. I'm a tiny, quiet person but I'm confident and good at my job and I usually do a good job at portraying that. I have noticed throughout my career that people seem to assume my male coworkers are more skilled or smarter until I can show them that's not true, but at least in an office I have more time to prove them wrong. In these speed networking situations I'm at a loss.

The other guys I was with wouldn't let me get a word in with someone who's very high up in a major company and is currently hiring people our age to the point that the female coworker he was with made eye contact and gave me a knowing look after the millionth time they interrupted me. I'm sure she's experienced the same thing so that's why she noticed, but by this point it didn't matter-- this male executive already barely looked at me, even though I can start working in December, live in his city, and have had 3 internships doing exactly what he's hiring for, and the guys I was with graduate in 2 years, live 1000 miles away, and are just getting started.

I don't know what to do. I really think I completely screwed up my chances. I know in the future not to introduce myself with these guys, but I think I'm going to run into this problem a lot. 

How do you deal with getting noticed when surrounded by men who speak over you or when people assume you're not qualified? "

Everything was perfect, we got along great and enjoyed every minute of each other's company. Then, this summer I was on a different continent and we struggled to stay connected. 

Upon returning to school she broke up with me and we both thought it was the right choice. Now, being back at school together has brought us closer together and everything is basically to the way it was. But here is the catch. She will be studying abroad next semester and we will be taking internships for the summer in 2 different locations, more than a drive away. That's 9 months apart. 

I want to say yes to taking her back because I really care about her and she makes me very happy. However, I am scared of what being apart will do to us and part of me just wants to be free when she is away. I am also very nervous about being able to meet new people and part of me thinks holding on will just be the easy thing to do because I will risk not meeting someone new who I care about as much. 

I can post more details if they're necessary but thats the basis of my problem and at this point I just needed somewhere to vent and hopefully someone with a wise word of advice.


tl/dr: should I take back my ex girlfriend who I really care about even though we will be apart for 9 months once December rolls around?"
3ojr55,3,2015-10-13,[M/22] Looking for an outside perspective on my situation,forquestions12121431,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/3ojr55/m22_looking_for_an_outside_perspective_on_my/,"Throwaway because this story alone is more than enough to pinpoint who I am if you were remotely related to the situation.

Here is some back story, and an apology in advance that it’s going to be long as hell. Tl:dr at the bottom

I am in college majoring in physics/philosophy and last semester in one of my philosophy classes I ended up in an outside-class discussion group purely by chance (there were only two options left when I got to make my choice of groups, though I didn’t really care anyway, and I mistakenly thought there was someone I disliked in one of the groups so I chose the other). As a note this group was mainly female and already friends (except for me).  These discussions would play out over the course of a semester. 

The first couple of discussions were kind of uneventful, as you’d expect, and like most group discussions I have been a part of, it felt kind of pointless and forced (i.e. people either didn’t really have an opinion or even knew what was going on). But eventually, towards the end of the semester, one of the discussions touched on something that was polarizing, as well as something I was interested in and have a relatively unique, thought-out view on, and as a result the discussion became relatively lively. One girl in particular had always been surprisingly kind to me, and suddenly seemed particularly interested in what I said.

After this discussion, we had already met our necessary discussion quota for the course but there was talk among the girls for some reason of doing another one (I still am not sure what the motive was for doing an additional discussion session, but I was happy to oblige because I like this stuff). I had another class with the girl mentioned above, and on the last day of said class she turns and says to me that the rest of the group is planning to have this one last discussion right now, if I am interested. I agree to come down. The same sort of things comes up, albeit in a different philosophical context. Again this girl is giggly and smiling at what I say, though it seems to contrast somewhat with what she believes. At a certain point, it becomes one of the girls essentially interrogating me about what I believe and me defending it sufficiently, while one seems checked out and the girl in particular continuing to smile and laugh (from across the round table we are sitting at). After making some poignant point that I no longer remember, I look at the girl that is sitting across from me smiling and on the verge of laughter, while the others are writing notes, and I smile back in a sort of playful way as if to say, “what did I say/what are you smiling about?”. I hold this eye contact for a second or two, before she responds laughing, “You are just so interesting to talk to,”.  This is obviously a good sign but I do not want to read too much into it. 

The conversation continues in this general pattern for a while, with one girl interrogating me, the girl across smiling and laughing, the other checked out. As the conversation comes to a close and we decide the specifics of how we are going to report our discussions for credit, I get up to throw away my coffee cup and as I am walking back past the table, the girl in particular has a funny look on her face (as if wondering whether I am going to walk back past the table or continue in the other direction, or at least that’s how I interpreted it) and says something to the effect of, “hey our dorms are close by, mind if I walk back with you?”.  Of course, I assent and we walk and talk for the five or so minutes the walk takes (important to note here that my social anxiety takes this semi-unique form where I have trouble initially talking to someone or starting a conversation, but once I get rolling I think I am relatively outgoing and smooth, as if am a shy extrovert; thus already warmed up I took the lead during this conversation and it flowed naturally and smoothly). Turns out she apparently knows where I am living based on looking at some roster (she occasionally works the front desk at the dorm I live despite living in a different one), which again seems like a relatively good sign that I do not necessarily want to read too much into. At this point, in hindsight, I should have made a point to ask if she wanted to have such a discussion/conversation again or just hangout, but instead as we approached my stop, she said something to the effect of, “well you are really interesting to talk to,” again and continued on her way while I felt content to smile and go my way. *As a note, this isn’t like she waited for me to say something, so I am not a complete tool, she did just keep walking past my stop while saying this, so I would have had to interrupt her and get her to turn around (and I am really not used to doing such a thing).

	
At this point I have grown to really like this girl, she is beautiful, kind, and is a bit of a thinker, i.e. pretty much exactly what I desire in a girl (or even just a friend for that matter). However, after this walk there is literally no interaction between us in class or otherwise (to be fair there is only like one day left of class at this point) and she makes no further effort to contact or interact with me. This seems like an extremely negative sign. I do talk to her once of my own volition after the end of classes (because she happens to be working the desk of my dorm at the time) about preparing for the final in the other class we share and she offers to add me to a Google Doc that a number of other people in the class are working on for said final. This is essentially my last contact between the summer and now. This is a good point to note that I do not have any social media presence (i.e. I’m not on Facebook or Vine or Twitter or Instagram, etc.) for no real reason, I just did not initially sign up because I felt there was no point/didn’t want the added drama and by this point it would feel weird (or too late) signing up, especially because the only people I would really add as friends are 4-5 other people who are actually and genuinely my friends. I express that I do not have a Facebook to her during the Google Doc conversation, as she asks something to the effect of, “Well if you don’t understand something, you can message me on facebook,”.  I am still aware that 99% of western teenagers and young adults have at least some form of social media (and to be honest I didn’t think it would ever actually matter until I realized at this point that it would make it difficult to cultivate this particular relationship), so her lack of contact in the wake of this revelation is probably a bad sign. 

Anyway, I focus on finishing my finals for the time being, but I check her twitter afterwards to see what her situation is, assuming that she likely has an internship lined up since she was a junior, and the first tweet I see is geotagged from a completely different state and is about an internship as I expected. At this point I decide that it would be weird/pointless to text her (especially since the reason I have her number is due to the group discussions and not for the explicit purpose of pursuing a relationship, romantic or otherwise). I thus wait out the summer till this semester, where it turns out by pure chance that we have a class together. 

Now the problem comes. I have been cognizant of not creating too great of a mental idealization of who she is (at the end of the day she is just a girl, one of many that I assume I could be happy with). But she has not given me any explicit, over-the-top indications that she is interested (there are moments of somewhat extended eye contact or other such minors things, but it seems to me that this could easily be by accident, and if I didn’t feel the way I did about her I would brush them off as nothing significant). So I am left wondering if she is interested, but I get the feeling there must not be much there otherwise she would be taking the initiative. Obviously the way to solve this is I walk up to her after class and ask if she is interested in hanging out sometime, but as I have found over the past couple of classes, the thought of doing this makes me so nervous and my heart beat so fast that I am not sure it is an actual physical option available to me. Even getting a moderate buzz (not so much that I am stumbling, but that I will sort of stumble every now and again on a long walk because I just don’t particularly care to stop myself), I am still not able to approach her. I had the option to tonight, having bought a reusable water bottle and filled it with a somewhat calculated amount of alcohol for the explicit purpose of lowering my inhibitions and asking her after class; seeing her walking away slowly I could not bring myself to run up and talk to her even in this state. (A note here, I have surprisingly have had girlfriends in the past, but they have all been the one that has taken initiative in starting the relationship).

Potentially, I could fix this in the long term by asking out other girls that I have no such strong feelings towards to build confidence, understanding of the social game, etc. (I assume that I will do this eventually, as long as this particular scenario falls through), but given that this is my last year in college and I have no real guarantee I’ll ever see her again, I’d at least like to make an attempt at it. Given this, it seems that my only option left is to text her, which I recognize is a bit shit: we see each other twice a week at minimum in class, (though we haven’t talked) so why couldn’t I just ask her about it then? A normal person surely would have said something by now?

But given my extreme anxiety at approaching her (note I feel relatively confident that after the initial garnering of attention I would have relatively little trouble talking with her), do you think it is reasonable to text her, or at least, I should text her considering that the other options are seemingly unavailable? I was thinking of texting something tomorrow like, “I probably should be asking this in person, but I enjoyed talking with you last year, would you like to hangout and do something like that again?”. Is that reasonable or no?


Tl:dr – I like a girl and have not really had an opportunity to sharpen my skills when it comes to approaching a girl I like, and am starting to really overthink everything: thus when I begin to approach her I get so insanely nervous that it is impossible for me to continue, even when a bit buzzed. Since I do not have a Facebook, the only option I have left is to text her, even though I only have her number as a result of a group discussion instead of for the explicit purpose of friendship or romantic relationship (even if you could say we got along well during the discussions).  Though she at one point seemed to be giving me positive signals, I am unsure at this point where we stand. Should I text her? I feel like I might as well at this point but I’d like to get people’s opinions on it.

I got offered a second round interview for an internship but it is for next summer!! I really want to work at the firm but what am I supposed to do until then? I want to study for the CPA exam but I need to have some income. Is it possible to ask to intern part-time until the position starts? And when should I bring this up? Thank you! "

Here is some back story, and an apology in advance that it’s going to be long as hell. Tl:dr at the bottom

I am in college majoring in physics/philosophy and last semester in one of my philosophy classes I ended up in an outside-class discussion group purely by chance (there were only two options left when I got to make my choice of groups, though I didn’t really care anyway, and I mistakenly thought there was someone I disliked in one of the groups so I chose the other). As a note this group was mainly female and already friends (except for me).  These discussions would play out over the course of a semester. 

The first couple of discussions were kind of uneventful, as you’d expect, and like most group discussions I have been a part of, it felt kind of pointless and forced (i.e. people either didn’t really have an opinion or even knew what was going on). But eventually, towards the end of the semester, one of the discussions touched on something that was polarizing, as well as something I was interested in and have a relatively unique, thought-out view on, and as a result the discussion became relatively lively. One girl in particular had always been surprisingly kind to me, and suddenly seemed particularly interested in what I said.

After this discussion, we had already met our necessary discussion quota for the course but there was talk among the girls for some reason of doing another one (I still am not sure what the motive was for doing an additional discussion session, but I was happy to oblige because I like this stuff). I had another class with the girl mentioned above, and on the last day of said class she turns and says to me that the rest of the group is planning to have this one last discussion right now, if I am interested. I agree to come down. The same sort of things comes up, albeit in a different philosophical context. Again this girl is giggly and smiling at what I say, though it seems to contrast somewhat with what she believes. At a certain point, it becomes one of the girls essentially interrogating me about what I believe and me defending it sufficiently, while one seems checked out and the girl in particular continuing to smile and laugh (from across the round table we are sitting at). After making some poignant point that I no longer remember, I look at the girl that is sitting across from me smiling and on the verge of laughter, while the others are writing notes, and I smile back in a sort of playful way as if to say, “what did I say/what are you smiling about?”. I hold this eye contact for a second or two, before she responds laughing, “You are just so interesting to talk to,”.  This is obviously a good sign but I do not want to read too much into it. 

The conversation continues in this general pattern for a while, with one girl interrogating me, the girl across smiling and laughing, the other checked out. As the conversation comes to a close and we decide the specifics of how we are going to report our discussions for credit, I get up to throw away my coffee cup and as I am walking back past the table, the girl in particular has a funny look on her face (as if wondering whether I am going to walk back past the table or continue in the other direction, or at least that’s how I interpreted it) and says something to the effect of, “hey our dorms are close by, mind if I walk back with you?”.  Of course, I assent and we walk and talk for the five or so minutes the walk takes (important to note here that my social anxiety takes this semi-unique form where I have trouble initially talking to someone or starting a conversation, but once I get rolling I think I am relatively outgoing and smooth, as if am a shy extrovert; thus already warmed up I took the lead during this conversation and it flowed naturally and smoothly). Turns out she apparently knows where I am living based on looking at some roster (she occasionally works the front desk at the dorm I live despite living in a different one), which again seems like a relatively good sign that I do not necessarily want to read too much into. At this point, in hindsight, I should have made a point to ask if she wanted to have such a discussion/conversation again or just hangout, but instead as we approached my stop, she said something to the effect of, “well you are really interesting to talk to,” again and continued on her way while I felt content to smile and go my way. *As a note, this isn’t like she waited for me to say something, so I am not a complete tool, she did just keep walking past my stop while saying this, so I would have had to interrupt her and get her to turn around (and I am really not used to doing such a thing).

	
At this point I have grown to really like this girl, she is beautiful, kind, and is a bit of a thinker, i.e. pretty much exactly what I desire in a girl (or even just a friend for that matter). However, after this walk there is literally no interaction between us in class or otherwise (to be fair there is only like one day left of class at this point) and she makes no further effort to contact or interact with me. This seems like an extremely negative sign. I do talk to her once of my own volition after the end of classes (because she happens to be working the desk of my dorm at the time) about preparing for the final in the other class we share and she offers to add me to a Google Doc that a number of other people in the class are working on for said final. This is essentially my last contact between the summer and now. This is a good point to note that I do not have any social media presence (i.e. I’m not on Facebook or Vine or Twitter or Instagram, etc.) for no real reason, I just did not initially sign up because I felt there was no point/didn’t want the added drama and by this point it would feel weird (or too late) signing up, especially because the only people I would really add as friends are 4-5 other people who are actually and genuinely my friends. I express that I do not have a Facebook to her during the Google Doc conversation, as she asks something to the effect of, “Well if you don’t understand something, you can message me on facebook,”.  I am still aware that 99% of western teenagers and young adults have at least some form of social media (and to be honest I didn’t think it would ever actually matter until I realized at this point that it would make it difficult to cultivate this particular relationship), so her lack of contact in the wake of this revelation is probably a bad sign. 

Anyway, I focus on finishing my finals for the time being, but I check her twitter afterwards to see what her situation is, assuming that she likely has an internship lined up since she was a junior, and the first tweet I see is geotagged from a completely different state and is about an internship as I expected. At this point I decide that it would be weird/pointless to text her (especially since the reason I have her number is due to the group discussions and not for the explicit purpose of pursuing a relationship, romantic or otherwise). I thus wait out the summer till this semester, where it turns out by pure chance that we have a class together. 

Now the problem comes. I have been cognizant of not creating too great of a mental idealization of who she is (at the end of the day she is just a girl, one of many that I assume I could be happy with). But she has not given me any explicit, over-the-top indications that she is interested (there are moments of somewhat extended eye contact or other such minors things, but it seems to me that this could easily be by accident, and if I didn’t feel the way I did about her I would brush them off as nothing significant). So I am left wondering if she is interested, but I get the feeling there must not be much there otherwise she would be taking the initiative. Obviously the way to solve this is I walk up to her after class and ask if she is interested in hanging out sometime, but as I have found over the past couple of classes, the thought of doing this makes me so nervous and my heart beat so fast that I am not sure it is an actual physical option available to me. Even getting a moderate buzz (not so much that I am stumbling, but that I will sort of stumble every now and again on a long walk because I just don’t particularly care to stop myself), I am still not able to approach her. I had the option to tonight, having bought a reusable water bottle and filled it with a somewhat calculated amount of alcohol for the explicit purpose of lowering my inhibitions and asking her after class; seeing her walking away slowly I could not bring myself to run up and talk to her even in this state. (A note here, I have surprisingly have had girlfriends in the past, but they have all been the one that has taken initiative in starting the relationship).

Potentially, I could fix this in the long term by asking out other girls that I have no such strong feelings towards to build confidence, understanding of the social game, etc. (I assume that I will do this eventually, as long as this particular scenario falls through), but given that this is my last year in college and I have no real guarantee I’ll ever see her again, I’d at least like to make an attempt at it. Given this, it seems that my only option left is to text her, which I recognize is a bit shit: we see each other twice a week at minimum in class, (though we haven’t talked) so why couldn’t I just ask her about it then? A normal person surely would have said something by now?

But given my extreme anxiety at approaching her (note I feel relatively confident that after the initial garnering of attention I would have relatively little trouble talking with her), do you think it is reasonable to text her, or at least, I should text her considering that the other options are seemingly unavailable? I was thinking of texting something tomorrow like, “I probably should be asking this in person, but I enjoyed talking with you last year, would you like to hangout and do something like that again?”. Is that reasonable or no?


Tl:dr – I like a girl and have not really had an opportunity to sharpen my skills when it comes to approaching a girl I like, and am starting to really overthink everything: thus when I begin to approach her I get so insanely nervous that it is impossible for me to continue, even when a bit buzzed. Since I do not have a Facebook, the only option I have left is to text her, even though I only have her number as a result of a group discussion instead of for the explicit purpose of friendship or romantic relationship (even if you could say we got along well during the discussions).  Though she at one point seemed to be giving me positive signals, I am unsure at this point where we stand. Should I text her? I feel like I might as well at this point but I’d like to get people’s opinions on it.

I have a 3.1 g.p.a., no internship experiences, and very few networks. My professors' connections mostly are in academia, which is amazing if you want to go to grad school, but I want an entry level job. 

There are 50 people in my graduating class and of those 50, around 10-15 get recruited by companies that come to career fairs at my school. That leaves the other 35-40 in the dust. I'm going to the career fair this fall and of the maybe 50 companies there, only four are actually hiring chemical engineers, which dampens my hope a bit. Usually there is a huge line of my colleagues with better experience/grades than I have in front of me when I try to talk to them in hopes of scoring an interview.

I am willing to relocate to anywhere across the United States for an entry level job. I'm also willing to go to the career center at my school every single day for resume/cover letter critique before I send out any applications. That and I am totally willing to send as many thank-you notes, calls to HR, and reminder e-mails to companies as needed. Besides that, how else should I go about getting a good job lined up before graduation? Am I too worried? Are chances better than I think they are? I don't want to send up to 1000 applications before I get a job. :("

* All tablets should download the same applications as tablet 1, and use the same app settings (if possible)


Extra info:

- We are talking about 14 tablets, specifically made for school environments by a company called Prowise.

- 3 tablets are the older model, Prowise PT002, while 11 others are the newer Prowise PT201. Hardware specs are pretty much the same, but the PT002 run stock Android 4.1.1 (can't upgrade to a newer version), and the PT201 run stock Android 4.2.2."

And I know that I'm probably more privileged than most others, so I want to make the most I can out of it. But I need some pointers that can help me find something I will enjoy doing.

For the most part, I was really into computer science in school and didn't really consider studying anything else. In fact I started studying comp sci here in my home town (it's basically free) on Monday. The thing is that while a career based on a degree like this seems really attractive financially wise I doubt that I will be happy working as a software engineer if not for google or valve or so. Also, I'm 17 years old. I skipped 2 years in school (sorry if that comes across as bragging, I'm really trying not to) and just studying computer science till im 20 and then starting to work seems so incredibly dull even with a year of working holiday or so sometime. But with how old or rather young I am, I can luckily start with something completely new.

So I've been thinking about other things that might interest me:

* **Biology/Marine Sciences** - this seems like an interesting field to work in. I did an internship at an institute and enjoyed it a lot, same with Biology class in school, but my grades weren't exactly the best.

* **Aviation** - being a pilot or working as an engineer in that field. I don't think I'd like being an airline pilot tho and I don't know how different other piloting jobs are.

* **Space research** - another thing I'm interested in and working at NASA or ESA rather seems nice

* **Military** - maybe not as a foot soldier but there's so many other careers I might find something.

On a slightly unrelated note to what I study, another question is *where*. I've been toying with the idea of studying abroad in some english speaking country a lot. I think it would be far more interesting, a good experience and I like the idea of living in a dorm instead of alone at home:

* **USA**: rip-offfff

* **England**: Seems nice but really expensive...

* **Scotland**: Actually way cheaper. I sadly don't match the minimum requirements for some majors at Edinbourgh and Glasgow. I tried really hard in school but seemed to have always fucked up my grades in the end at some time. Also as I said I didn't think about studying something else than comp sci so at some points in time I didn't care about my grades. Oh well, can't change that anymore. 

* **New Zealand**: I was there for 4 weeks in September and absolutely loved it. I liked Wellington specifically and the German Astronaut Alexander Gerst studied there. I had a look around one of the Halls in Auckland and the people there seemed really cool and happy (might just be confirmation bias and the tour not being longer than an hour). Seems especially good for Biology or Marine Biology. But even though there are some scholarships I could maybe get, and I could work while I'm still here in Germany, soo expensive. But if I could freely choose I'd actually go there, I think.

* **Germany**: In all objectivity, and financially, the best option would be to stay here where I am. I live in Berlin which is pretty cool. I just wish I wouldn't want to go somewhere else so desperately.

Did anyone actually read all of this? If not this is still a good overview for myself. I'm well aware that I might came across as whiny or so, and I do know how well off I actually am compared to other people in this world. So it feels a bit.. arrogant? to think about this so much and not know what to do with all these chances that are given to me."

I feel like the voting system could be *a lot* better, so I'm gonna change it up. I'm just going to put eight parent comments with the matchups instead of sixteen comments with the characters names so you guys don't have to memorize them/keep scrolling up and down, and I'll reply to the parent comment with the characters in said matchup. That way, it's a bit more organized. I considered doing straw polls for each matchup, but I figured it'd be a lot easier for you guys to upvote than to open up eight new links to vote.

Also, I meant to get this out to you on Sunday, *(even though I said ""See you Monday at the end of my post for some reason,)* but I couldn't get ahold of the mods for /r/comedybangbang in time to request contest mode be taken off so I could count the votes. I couldn't count them until about 10:30 on Monday night. Nothing against the mods over there at all, they're great.


So another thing I'm going to change is that the tournament posts won't be coming out every two days like my last tournament. That way, I don't feel like I *have* to meet a deadline with this thing, and get mad when things like this happen. No more voting deadlines, either. Not like it mattered anyway, since there's no way to see what times people upvoted a post. And also, this slightly prevents it from cluttering the subreddit with tournament posts. If these aren't coming out every couple days, then they won't be cluttering the subreddit.


Sorry if none of this is understandable, I'm typing this at midnight and I'm super tired right now.

Boy, I really wrote a fucking novel about such a silly tournament.

With that ...

I am fairly new in the UK and have only just secured this housing, so to be going through this is very stressful. I appreciate any and all advice and perspectives.

I moved into my current room on October first. I am living in a private home, but the landlady/mom seemed quite nice, and we signed a contract specifying my monthly rent. Because I had only arrived in the UK a few days before, the mom generously allowed me to hold off on paying her the rent and deposit until I had opened up a bank account and transferred funds from my German account.

My bank account and money transfer issues were settled last week. I paid her the deposit in cash, and requested her bank details so I could transfer her the rent money, as my rent is over what my bank allows me to pull out of an atm. She delayed for several days on giving me this information. 

Today I finally get her bank information by text. In that same text she informed me that she thought my rent was not in line with other listings in the area and that she would be raising it £30, effective immediately, and another £50 come January. I reminded her that we had signed a legally binding contract, and referred her to the uk's government website on tenancy agreements--namely the part where she can't legally change a fixed-term let price until after my fixed-term let is over. I also said I would be paying my rent today--the amount we agreed in the contract. But she's insisting on carrying this through and says it's different for a private house.

What is the legality of this situation, and what are my legal options? I can't afford the rent increase as I am just an intern, but I also can't afford to move out again. I'm really stressed and really upset, so anything you can offer me I will happily take.

**Update: The landlord and I have come to a compromise: the rent stays what it is until January, at which point it increases £80. This gives me a bit more time to find new housing. I was debating just paying the increased rent, but then I figured there's nothing to stop her from pulling this on me again, given that she's already demonstrated how incapable she is of sticking to a contract.**"
3om4rs,16,2015-10-13,"Me [19F] with my best friend [19f] of 6 years lives across the country from me, and just informed me that she is suicidal. I have done as much as I can think of to help, but I am not sure if it's enough. PLEASE HELP.",suicidalbff,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3om4rs/me_19f_with_my_best_friend_19f_of_6_years_lives/,"I guess I'll first start by saying that I am a longtime r/relationships lurker, and I have seen this sub give some amazing advice and help a lot of people tremendously, and I am really hoping you all can pull through for me as I am REALLY in over my head here. I'll do my best to keep this as short as possible, however I want to provide you with all of the details too, so this will probably end up being pretty long. I made a throwaway account because my best friend knows my usual reddit account. 

BACKGROUND: (if you don't want to read this, skip down to PRESENT DAY. Essentially, I went through some major shit in high school and Sam helped me through it)
My best friend, ""Sam"" and I have been extremely close since freshman year of high school. We had known each other all through middle school, but we really became close after my mom was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer our first semester of high school. I struggled a lot with her diagnosis, and as a result became really withdrawn from my friends. Sam was the only friend in our ""group"" that was really there for me through all of this. While my other friends claimed they ""felt awkward"" around me and, ""didn't know what to say"" to me, Sam stepped up and supported me through it all. Flash forward to senior year of high school, my mom is still battling cancer and we are having serious financial struggles so I am not only taking really hard classes in order to get into college, but also working up to 30 hours per week to try and support my family as best as I can. At this time I start missing a lot of school because the pressure of my family issues and work is starting to get to me, and as a result I start failing multiple classes. Sam and I were in the same higher level education program, so we had every class together, and Sam took it upon herself to communicate with our teachers what I was going through because all of my teachers were starting to worry about me not graduating. This was honestly the lowest point in my life. I was failing classes because of the overwhelming amount of stress I was under, and I just shut down. I found myself laying in bed for days on end, completely incapable of finding the strength to get out of bed and face the day. I called into work and school pretending to be sick, when in reality I was laying around ignoring my responsibilities. After weeks of answering our teachers questions about me, and essentially covering for me, Sam showed up to my house unexpectedly and basically told me to get my ass up out of bed and get ready, because she was taking me to the library to do all of the work I was missing, and was not going to let me miss anymore school. She came over everyday for the last few weeks of school and literally forced me to do my homework and get my ass out of bed. She made me appointments with the therapist I had stopped seeing, and made sure I attended them. She basically single handedly dragged me out of the hole I had dug myself into, and for that I am eternally grateful. Without her, I wouldn't have graduated high school and been able to attend the university that I am now going to, and I would likely still be in that awful dark place. 

PRESENT DAY:
Sam is going to a really prestigious school in the mid-west (she's insanely intelligent and got a full ride scholarship) and I am going to school about an hour away from our hometown. We just started our second year of college this Fall. I didn't see Sam all summer because she landed a really awesome internship at her school for the summer, so I was only able to see her for about two days right before school started up for me. From what Sam has told me about her college experience thus far, she seems like she really loves it and is finding that she fits in really well at her school. She struggled a LOT with her identity in high school (she is bisexual) and she has found a lot of acceptance in college from what it seems. However, she has always had issues with depression and anxiety and has only recently since moving away to college had the resources to get help. She has always found little to no support from her family about her mental health problems, and they tried to force their religion on her in an attempt to ""reverse"" her ""gay tendencies"". She essentially, has been through quite a lot of adversity in her high school years as well. Since being at school she appears to have been doing all she can to better herself, and from our phone and skype conversations I have learned that she has been seeing both a therapist and a psychiatrist and has also been spending a lot of time working out and changing her diet. The psychiatrist has her on different meds for her anxiety and depression and it seemed overall that she was really serious about getting help. I have noticed though, that she goes through extreme highs and lows. One day I'll talk to her and she seems to be doing really well, another day though she'll tell me that she is really struggling and feels very alone. I check up on her frequently, and encourage her to continue exercising and going to therapy, but overall I am not with her physically so it is hard to gauge how she is really doing. I guess I always wrote off her extreme highs and lows to the tumultuous road to recovery from depression. I always assumed that yes, she was struggling, but because she was being very proactive in trying to get better that it was all okay. I was wrong. 

She called me this weekend hysterical because her girlfriend of almost a year had dumped her. She said she just wanted someone to ""cry to"" and of course I listened and tried my best to comfort her. I encouraged her to hit the gym and keep herself busy because that (in my experience) is the best way to deal with a breakup. I checked up on her everyday since the breakup, and she seemed to be doing alright considering the circumstances. She called me last night though, hysterical once again, and said she was dropping out of school because she couldn't handle being alone and that she was ""afraid she might do something really bad"" if she had to spend any more time alone. I asked her what she meant and she said that she had already attempted suicide once since the breakup (which I had no idea about even though I talked to her everyday because she was telling me that everything was alright and she TRULY sounded like she was being genuine!). She told me that she's alone for the next week in her apartment because her roommate is on a trip and that she ""doesn't trust herself to be alone"". I told her that she has to call a close friend at school ASAP to come pick her up and let her stay with them for the rest of the week. She told me she was going to hang up the phone and call them, and then get back to me. Ten minutes later she calls and says her friend is on the way, and during that time I had gathered the numbers of the suicide hotlines for her area, which I then forwarded to her. While on the phone with her I STRONGLY encouraged her to have her friend drive her to the hospital so she can seek psychiatric help IMMEDIATELY and she agreed that that was a good idea. I also insisted that she send me her friends contact info so that I can get in touch with them and make sure she's alright. She then had to hang up because her friend was apparently there to pick her up, and she said she would keep me updated. After the phone call I google searched ""what to do when someone is suicidal"" and I learned the following things:
#1) that it is extremely important for this person to feel loved and supported #2) that it is important that they have numbers for suicide hotlines and #3) that if they have continuous suicidal thoughts or have already attempted suicide to get help ASAP. So, I contacted two of our very close friends and informed them what was going on. I told them that it is really important for her to feel supported and loved and if they could both reach out to her that could be really helpful. I don't know if this was the right thing to do, but she seemed to appreciate it. She sent me a long text explaining that she was at the hospital and that she was probably going to be admitted to the psych ward for a few days and that she really really appreciated me getting our friends together to support her through this even though we couldn't physically be with her. I asked her if I should contact her family and explain to them what's going on (normally I would have already done this but like I explained above, her family is not the most supportive and understanding, and she doesn't have a close relationship with them). She said she has already informed them about this so she does not want me to contact them. She then told me that she couldn't talk for a few days because they were transferring her to a hospital in the city (her college is in a small town) and that she couldn't text back until she was out of the hospital. This all happened late last night and I sent her one last text of encouragement before she had to say goodbye because she had arrived at the hospital. 

At first I was really relieved that she was getting help, but then I realized... how do I REALLY know? She never gave me her friends contact information, so I have no way of knowing if she really is where she says she is. She has always been an honest person but I am starting to question everything because this is an extremely serious situation and her life is at stake. I am totally in over my head here! If she were here or I was there it would be an absolute no brainer that I would be there with her to take her to the hospital and see she gets through this, but I'm thousands of miles away and I feel like the support that I can offer isn't enough! I don't know what to do. Should I call her family and make sure they know what is happening? I don't want to get them involved if they are only going to make things worse because she doesn't get along well with them but at the same time I don't feel comfortable potentially being the only one knowing what is happening! She said that she has kept them informed about this, but once again, how am I supposed to know if that's true? I feel like such an awful friend. She helped me through so much and I want to be there to help her through this dark time in her life but I do not have the financial means to get there and help her the way she helped me. I also (as horribly selfish as this sounds) have so much responsibility tying me down here (school/work) that I don't know if I could even put that all on hold to fly out there and help her even if I could afford it. I am not experienced in dealing with suicidal people, so I may have totally taken the wrong steps here and I am not afraid of taking criticism from you guys. What I really need is advice on what to do next. Her phone is currently turned off so talking to Sam is out of the question. Please help me figure out what the next step in all this is. Sorry again for the length of this post, and also sorry if it is really incoherent and all over the place. I am really upset right now as this whole situation is tearing me up inside. Sam is my best friend in the whole world and I love her so much and couldn't forgive myself if anything happened to her. All I want is for her to be okay.

**tl;dr**: Best friend that lives far away told me that she is suicidal and says she has admitted herself to the hospital but I am not sure if this is true or not. Need help figuring out what else I can do to ensure her safety.

3om62i,2,2015-10-13,[Advice] Need advice on pressure and labido effect,researchallthethings,sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/3om62i/advice_need_advice_on_pressure_and_labido_effect/,"Hey Sexxit! I'm hoping someone has had similar experiences in the past and can lend some helpful advice. I've tried to give as much background and context as I can, hence the wall-o-text, but skipping to the end bit is probably sufficient for most.

Wife (W26) and I (M26) have been together for about 10 years and married about 5 years. As a point of current comparison, I would say I am high libido and would love to have sex (PIV, mutual masturbation, whatever) every day or every other day at least. She is probably closer to average, maybe on the lower libido end, and says she'd be happy with once every week or two. Early on, as is typical of both early relationships and teens, we were quite sexually active; probably had sex on average once or twice a day for a year or so. We did it enough that she expressed the need to slow down a bit, if for nothing other than physical exhaustion. Now, we weren't having PIV five times a day or anything, but mutual masturbation and PIV usually would total twice or three times a day sometimes. So, I restrained myself a bit, and all was fine and we were at about three or four times a week.

Fast forward to college and living together, we would have sex (PIV or mutual masturbation) maybe two or three times per week if I recall correctly. This of course ebbed and flowed a bit, but that's about average I think. During that time, it got to the point that she actually felt I wasn't pursuing her enough or letting her know how I felt. Thus, I increased my external displays of affection and that seemed to help her feel more comfortable. I'd say, by the end of undergrad, we had sex maybe one or two times a week though. So, again, a drop, but still in at least a reasonable range.

Fast forward again to grad school and professional life, and the stress definitely impacted us a bit to have more ebb and flow (projects, reports, thousands of pages of reading, etc. and the associated stress/exhaustion will take time away from sexy times obviously). We're now in the once a week or two weeks range now. I would say I attempt to initiate, or at least tease her, a few times a day. I'm not necessarily trying to always get her to have sex, but it's probably leftover from needing to increase my external affections towards her in undergrad. And perhaps that is the major problem here.

She's now out of town for most of the week on internship and returns home during the weekend. The first couple weekends, we had sex again like at the end of high school. Over the weekend, we probably had sex three or four times total. It was great! And I honestly felt like she really wanted it. However, the rest of the time and for the past few years, the once a week or every other week has been the average frequency. I initiate, she usually says no, and I usually feel a bit let down (and show it I'm sure, even if I try not to) if I'm actually trying to get her to also have some fun. She then feels like she's (according to her after a large fight and then discussion regarding this) being pressured, ""broken,"" and potentially going to ruin the marriage because of not wanting sex as much. On the other hand, I often feel like she's not attracted to me (she says she still is very much and that is not the issue) or she's found someone else (highly doubtful and she says that's stupid of course).

So, at this point, I've agreed again to try to back off a bit (have done this before back in grad school, but I don't really think it changed anything) and try to not take it so bad when she doesn't reciprocate. On her end, she acknowledges that she's got something like a pressure block that, if she could stop worrying about it, would probably end up in wanting sex more, reciprocating, and initiating (I'd say I initiate 99% of the time).
So, fellow Sexxit-ers, has anyone ever encountered a similar issue? IE: not typically ebb and flow, but what appears to be a longer-term block due to pressure and/or expectation anxiety? Any tips on how to work through it? We've discussed potentially going to a sex therapist, but want to try to work on it ourselves first. Honestly, communication really isn't much of an issue with us for almost anything, and we love each other very much, and the sex is great when we have it, but the frequency is just too low for my preferences.

TL;DR-Longterm relationship where wife apparently feels too much pressure to perform, which in turn continues to reduce sexual frequency and anxiety. I've tried taking steps back and generally trying to be as accommodating as possible in the past, but it never seems to help much. Any tips?

3oma16,2,2015-10-13,(BEL) Any tips on how to support an international internship?,play2jens,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3oma16/bel_any_tips_on_how_to_support_an_international/,"I'm in my last year of my 3 year bachelor education of business with a specialization in Marketing. For this degree, we have to do a three-month long internship abroad. I was pretty excited about this. I found myself a company in Barcelona, Spain which would like to hire me and pay me € 300 a month. I also applied for an Erasmus+ grant which would be about € 320 a month. 

So, everything was going well until today. My company send me an email saying that they won't be able to pay me because of some policy. (We didn't sign anything yet, so it's okay). Later that day, I got an email saying that I won't get the grant (probably because my grades are not high enough). I talked to my parents about it, they told me that they won't be able to give me much each month. I can expect about € 200 each month. 

I did some research; most shared apartments in Barcelona still cost me about € 300-350 a month. Food to support myself will be around € 150-200 a month and a flight ticket about € 120. I was hoping to have some money so I could go out or at least do things in the weekends, but I can forget about that. 

I barely have any money on my saving account ( € 600 ). I have no student job atm because I'm studying Computer Engineering as well and I would like to avoid borrowing money at all costs. Even from relatives. 

Any advice?"
3omazz,1,2015-10-13,Office Women Part 13: Final Chapter,Scast716585,sexstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexstories/comments/3omazz/office_women_part_13_final_chapter/,"Monday morning I dragged myself to work, 24 hours ago I thought I would be in a great mood following my weekend with Kim, was now the worst I have ever felt. First, Kim and I confess our love for each other then she proceeds to tell me that she is moving out of town and we will not be seeing each other again. Then, I return home and find a note that my wife, Debbie, had left me for a woman, we had been together since high school and she leaves me a note, how fucking horrible. 

I went up to my office and did not want to see anyone, I also did not want to tell anyone about Debbie it was too soon and I did not want to talk about it. Unless the whole office knows because the woman she left me for was Linda from our accounting department. I also could not say anything about Kim as we kept our relationship a secret except for a few of her friends that she told about us or had seen us together. I tried to immerse myself in work to keep me going but it was not working. I had also made a decision to stop fucking all of the girls that I had been in the office. I know most guys that have their wife leave them would chase as much pussy as possible but I had found that all of the random fucking had left me empty and I was wanting more. That was what was so great about Kim was our connection, the sex was fantastic but it was the time together not having sex is what made it so special. I was determined to take it slow for a while. 

With that thought running through my head I looked up from my desk when I heard a knock on my door, it was Courtney my intern, “Hey boss, was wondering if I could meet with you over lunch and discuss whatever comes up” she said, as she licked her lips and played with the button on her blouse. Fuck she looked hot, her blouse was black silk that clung to her thin frame, you could see the outline of her nipples pressing against the fabric and she had the top three buttons undone and a long pearl necklace that hung down between her breasts. She was also wearing a tight skirt that was mid-thigh length, the material clung to her young, thin fit ass and legs but stretched when she moved. She came into my office and sat on the edge of my desk and spread her legs in front of me making her skirt slide up to her hips and giving me a view of her bare pussy, she rested one foot on my crotch. 

There could not have been a sexier creature ever in front of me. A few days ago I would have shut the door, right then and fucked her good and hard. Now I was in such a bad place I did not get hard with this ravishing creature in front of me. “Courtney, sorry but I just don’t think I am up to it today. You look so beautiful and sexy, but I just can’t. Any guy would be lucky to have you but I am so sorry I am not up to it” I said in a somber tone. 

“It is obvious you are not up to it” She said looking at my crotch and her foot rubbing my limp dick. “Let me know if you change your mind, I sure would love to wake up that big cock of yours” She walked out the door and god did her ass look great in that skirt. For a moment I questioned my decision thinking I should just take her out of the office and fuck every sweet tight hole of hers all day long. But I just thought better of it. 

I made it through the day, trying to avoid seeing Kim as I knew it would be tough. At the end of the day I was leaving and stopped to talk to Vicki our receptionist that is a good friend. 

“I was shocked to hear that Kim put her notice in and is moving, and isn’t it odd that Linda up and quit and just did not show up today, did you hear that” Vicki said to me as I came down. “You don’t seem like you are feeling that great, everything ok?” She said in a concerned tone. 

Vicki and I shared most things but I did not ever go on with her about all of my relations in the office and she never let on that she knew from any of the women. “Yeah, Kim told me she was leaving, I am real sad to see her go, we had gotten pretty close” I replied not wanting to say too much out of respect to Kim. “I also knew about Linda, I found out about that yesterday when my wife left me, to go live with her” I had to tell someone and Vicki and I are close, it felt good to say something.

“Holy shit, you are kidding aren’t you?” Vicki said totally stunned

“No that is the truth, they met each other a couple of months ago at a dinner we all went to and they had been seeing each other regularly, I did not know how regularly until last week, and then Debbie said they were going away together this past weekend. So I went away with a friend for the weekend and when I came home all of her stuff was gone, and she just left me a fucking note, a fucking note, do you believe it.” I still could not believe it as I said it. 

“Shit, I thought I had a bad weekend, my boyfriend broke up with me. I really did not feel like coming in today I felt so crappy about it. But I think you have me beat. At least he didn’t turn gay on me, at least I don’t think he did” She said jokingly. 

Hearing her make a joke about it made me smile. “Sorry to hear that, what kind of an idiot would break up with you. You are beautiful, fun, intelligent, you are just wonderful.”

“Thanks, you don’t have to say those things. Do you want to go get a drink and drown our sorrows together” Vicki asked

“I could really use one, glad you asked, and I do mean it he would have to be a fucking idiot to break up with you” I replied, we agreed on a place to meet and headed out. I did mean the guy would have to be an idiot to break up with her. Vicki has long blonde hair, the most beautiful blue eyes I have ever seen, she is at the most 5 feet tall but is real fit and has the most perfect ass I have ever seen and firm small breast that are the perfect size for her petite build. I had wanted her since the first time I met her but she was usually in a relationship and when she was not she made it clear she would never want to date a married man. This left us in the friend category but our friendship grew over time. 

I get to the bar a few minutes before her and ordered drinks for both of us, we had been out in a group before so I knew what she liked. She came running into the bar and gave me a hug. She looked as good as always wearing heels, tight black pants and a tight blue t-shirt that perfectly complimented her eyes. 

That night we drank allot for a Monday night, but we had fun and bitched about our relationships enough to make both of us feel better. We drank more than I thought and we ended taking a cab back to her place because she was only 5 minutes away. She got a pillow and a blanket and tossed them on the couch. “You should be pretty comfy there, I will see you in the morning, thanks for being there tonight.”

“No, thanks to you I feel much better having someone to talk to” I replied. We hugged and she gave me a quick kiss on the cheek and she went upstairs to bed. I thought to myself how different she is, all of the women I have been hanging out with would have had my dick in their mouth by now. Not that I did not really want her to, but it was a nice change. 

That morning I woke early to hear Vicki moving around in the kitchen, she was wearing sweat pants and a baggy t-shirt she looked cute and sexy. “Sorry did I wake you, I can’t help it, I get up early every day, just can’t sleep in” She said. I sat up “No problem, I like to get up early but I do admit I do feel a little hung over” I replied. 

“Were you hot last night, sorry about that, I like it warm in here, I noticed your shirt is off” She asked. 

“Oh yeah, sorry, I have trouble sleeping fully dressed, my shirt is not all that is off” I said looking at my pants laying on the floor. “You might want to turn around while I throw my clothes on” I realized that I had my usual full morning erection and just my boxers on which did not hide my huge bulging thick cock. 

“I am not embarrassed, why are you” Vicki replied edging me on. 

“No, not at all” I answered and pushed off the blanket and walked across the room with my large bulging cock leading the way. I proudly stood there facing her for a moment so she could take a good look and imagine what I was hiding. 

“Holy fuck, I heard a rumor that you had a big cock but from that bulge I don’t think the rumor does you justice” Vick said walking closer to me. “What do you think now” I said as I pulled down my boxers and released my massive thick cock that was begging for attention. 

“Steve, I really like you, but I like to take things slow, and I think we need to, so I don’t want to go too far right now, if that is OK with you?” She asked looking up at me with her beautiful blue eyes and grasping my cock in her small hand. I leaned down and kissed her. She is so tiny and petite, I was used to her in heels and with her walking around now at her house just made me more attracted to her. She led me to the couch and we kissed deeply and she stroked my cock. I caressed her perfect little ass and gently touched her breasts through her shirt, she was not wearing a bra and this aroused her nipples. We never broke our kiss and she kept on stroking my cock. I went to slide my hand under her shirt, I really wanted to see her small breasts and perky nipples. “No, not yet, let me just take care of you right now, lean back” Vicki asked and I responded leaning back against the couch and pushing my cock up as high as I could. “Wow you are so big, my hand looks so small around it, does that feel good?” she asked. 

“Yes that feels wonderful” I replied just laying back enjoying the attention and the sensation of her massaging and stroking my dick. She increased the pace of her stroking and started massaging my balls with her other hand. “You like that, I want to finish you” she said rubbing a little faster. “Oh yes, a little more that will do it, a little more” I moaned and finally exploded, a huge amount of cum shooting up in the air and all over my stomach. “Wow you did like that, let me clean you up” Vicki said as she went into the kitchen to get a towel. I thanked her and we kissed again, grabbing another feel of her firm ass. She told me that was enough for now and I dressed, she made me breakfast and I called for a cab to take me to my car so I could go home to shower and change before work. 

That day I was feeling better, I made a point of going to see Vicki a few times during the day which made up both happy and I surprised her with a big bouquet of flowers that were delivered to her home that evening. We started dating like real dates, dinner, movies, shopping just usual stuff. Not meeting up and fucking like crazy like I was used to. But it was great, she made me happy just being with her and I had made it clear to all of the other women in the office that I no longer was going to see any of them. 

It had been about a month that we had been dating and we still had not had sex, Vicki a few more times jerked me off but I never got past touching her over her clothes. I did not mind as our relationship was really building and I did not want to ruin it. It was finally her birthday and planned on taking her out for a nice dinner and had gotten her some gifts. I picked her up at her place and she looked fantastic. She was wearing a tight black dress that was short, like not much over your ass short, and a low v-cut that had her small firm boobs pushed up to show some cleavage. Her long blond hair flowed over her shoulders and down her back. She had 4 inch heels on that made her tan bare legs look extra sexy. 

“Wow, you look beautiful” I exclaimed. “Happy birthday” I said handing her a bag with a few small wrapped boxes. 

“Should I open them now” she said blushing. “Yes please do” I replied. She sat and opened the gifts which were matching gold and sapphire ear rings, necklace and bracelet. She had a tear roll down her cheek. “Is there something wrong” I asked. “No they are beautiful and I love them. I just never had anyone buy me something so nice before, I really love them” she answered quietly. “I thought the sapphires would be great with your blue eyes, let me help you with the necklace” I answered and continued “You have been there for me and are such a great friend, and over this past month you have grown to be more than just a friend, I am a little scared to say this but I love you” in a very nervous tone. Vicki smiled and hugged me and kissed me deeply. “I was scared to say it. I love you too” she said now smiling and kissed me again. 

“Ok let’s get to dinner” I said as we got up and headed out “Damn you look amazing” I pronounced as we walked towards the car with her perfect ass in that short dress teasing me.

We ate and talked all night, she kept staring at her presents and never stopped smiling. Seeing her this happy made me happy. Vicki suggested we go back to her place after dinner rather than going to a club like we had planned. She said she just wanted to be with me tonight. I was fine with that. All the drive home I had trouble focusing on the road because she looked so hot sitting next to me in her short little dress, I was so hard. We got to her place and I sat on the couch and opened a bottle of wine while Vicki got some glasses. When she came over to me she put the glasses on the coffee table and surprised me by sitting facing me on my lap with her legs on each side of me. This made her dress ride right up over her ass. 

“Oh I feel all tingly inside” she said as she kissed me. My one hand went right to her bare ass cheek, she had on a black thong and the other gently rubbed her breast. She whispered in my ear “Unzip me” and I pulled down the zipper in the back of her dress allowing her to pull it off over her head revealing a black push up bra and a good view of the thong. She slid closer on top of me grinding her pussy against my hard cock. She reached behind her and unfastened her bra and tossed it on the floor. I had been fantasizing about her breasts since our first morning together and here they were now staring at me. They did not disappoint. Perky B sized breasts that were firm but had some sag now that she is in her 30’s. Medium sized light brown nipples that were just right sized for her tits and they protruded out over an inch, god I love her little tits. 

“Do you like them, I worry they are too small, sorry about not letting you have them earlier” Vicki said looking down at her tits and cupping one in her hand. “They are perfect, they are really perfect for you I love them and I love you” I kissed her and felt both of her breasts pulling on her nipples. I then had to suck on them. Touching them and sucking them was getting her so excited she held my head against them you could tell how sensitive they are and how it excited her, the whole time she was grinding her pussy against my cock. It was far better than any stripper could do and it was getting her off. She finally moaned and held me tight as she tensed and came. 

“Wow I haven’t done that before, that felt real good” she sighed. “And look you are still fully dressed, we need to do something about that” I took off my shirt and she worked on my pants. She pulled them off onto the floor which left her kneeling in front of me, my massive hard cock staring her in the face. She grabbed my dick with both hands and guided it towards her mouth. She placed the tip of my cock in her mouth and was gently stroking the base of my cock with one hand. “It is so big, I can’t take more of it” She said trying to slide as much of my cock into her mouth. “What you are doing feels great don’t stop it feels so good” I moaned. Vicki picked up the pace of her sliding my cock into her wet inviting mouth, soaking my cock in her spit and stroking the wetness over the full length of my shaft. The whole time she stared up at me with her big blue eyes never breaking gaze from me. I stroked her long blonde hair away from her face as she worked my cock in and out of her mouth. She stopped sucking me for a moment to catch her breath but feverishly stroked my cock with both hands. “Oh wow you are going to make me cum, please don’t stop” I pleaded. “Come on baby, give me your cum, I want to make you cum” Vicki said as she slid her mouth back onto my cock. That was all I could take and exploded, shooting out more cum than I can ever remember, I shot it into her mouth onto her face into her hair and onto her chest. Vicki looked up at me and smiled, looking proud that she made me cum so much even though she was covered from my explosion. 

“I am going to go get a towel” she said as she got up and walked to the kitchen. This was the best view I have had of her as she got up and walked away only wearing her thong, she is so petite, fit and her ass is perfect. I was feeling so happy and satisfied and wondered to myself if we were finished for the evening, I wanted more of her but I also know we had been going slow so if this is all she wanted I was fine with it. “Wow you really made a mess of me, I am going to go take a shower” Vicki said as she walked towards the stairs to go up and shower. “Ok that sounds good” I replied. “Well why are you sitting there, I was hoping you would join me” she said as she ran up the stairs, I hopped up and chased after her. 

When I got to the top of the stairs she was waiting for me now naked holding her thong in her hand, revealing a small, well groomed landing strip and her bare pussy. She has big pussy lips that I could clearly see hanging down between her legs, which was clearly visible because her legs are thin and fit leaving a clear gap between them a good view at her pussy.  “You are so beautiful” I said pausing to take in her beauty, seeing her naked for the first time, all she had on was the jewelry I gave her earlier in the evening. “Thank you, get over here” she said as I walked over and hugged her. My body engulfed her, she is so tiny and petite, probably not even 5 feet tall and I am almost 6-4. I loved holding her. “Come on let’s get in the shower” She said taking me by the hand. 
We stood there kissing as we waited for the water to warm up and went into the shower, she looked even sexier with her hair and body wet. We soaped each other up, her body felt so good as I ran my hands over her breasts and she grabbed my big half hard cock and slowly stroked me. I leaned down and kissed her and reached down and placed my hand on her pussy, Vicki pressed her body tight against me and moaned with pleasure “That feels so good, oh that feels good” It felt good to me too, I dreamed about touching her pussy and now I finally had her and she was reacting to my every touch enjoying every moment. She broke away from me for a moment and sat on the built in bench in the shower and spread her legs wide having the water rinse the soap from her body. I dropped to my knees sucked on her nipples and touched her pussy, rubbing her clit. “Oh that feels amazing” she moaned. Needing more she gently pushed my head down to her pussy which is just what I wanted. I ran my tongue up and down her big lips and into her little hole and then attacked her clit with my tongue, this was driving her crazy as she held my head tight against her moaning louder and louder. I slid both of my hands up onto her breasts and played with her nipples. This was more than she could handle and she came hard shaking and her pussy oozing with moisture. I looked up into her blue eyes and she was smiling. I stood up and held her against me pressing her head against my stomach as she was still seated on the bench. My cock was now fully hard and stood out right next to face. 

Vicki grabbed my hard cock and stood up and shut off the water. “Come with me, I need to be with you” She said as we stepped out of the shower, toweled off and headed toward the bedroom. We stood next to the bed kissing and she pushed me back onto the bed and crawled on top of me. “I wanted to do this since that first morning I saw your cock, but I wanted to make sure of our feelings, I am sure now and I really want this” She said as she crawled on top of me grabbing my cock and sliding it into her pussy. She just eased the tip in as she is so tight and had trouble stretching around me. “I have never had such a big cock inside of me, I don’t know if I can take it” She said, I could feel her entire body tensing from her anxiousness about being able to take the girth of my cock. 

“I love you, I have dreamt of this moment from the first time I met you when I came in for my interview. I left the building that day hoping to get the job because I wanted to know the beautiful woman with the most spectacular blue eyes” as I told Vicki this I had slid my hands on her hips and helped ease her down on my cock as I thrusted slowly up into her. “I love you too, and oh fuck are you big” she replied. Her pussy now stretched over me feeling warm, wet and wonderful around my fully engorged dick. Now fully inside of her I sat up and kissed her deep and hard our tongues locked together and holding her tight as she adjusted to the size of me in her pussy. I could feel the tension she had in her body release as we kissed and she started to grind against me. 

“Oh fuck that feels so good now” Vicki moaned as she pushed me back down on the bed and started sliding up and down the full length of my shaft ever so slowly at first and gradually speeding up. “You are so beautiful and this feels so good” I said as I thrusted up into her. I played with her breasts and pulled on her nipples, the sensation of this made her moan louder and drive up and down on me faster. She is so small and looked so sexy with her long wet blonde hair as she rode me I never wanted this to end. “Hold on a second, how about like this does that feel good, oh fuck you are hitting me with your cock perfect oh fuck yes” She yelled as she had slid me all of the way in and spun around on me know facing away from me riding me reverse cowgirl. This gave me a perfect view of her little tight ass and my cock sliding in and out of her pussy, I grabbed her ass and helped her slide up and down my length. She started rubbing her clit with one hand “Yes, yes that is perfect, oh fuck yes, give me all of your cock oh fuck yes, I am going to cum, cum in me Steve of fuck cum in me” Vicki screamed now in a fury riding my cock. I pushed hard up into and came deep in her pussy and at the same time she shook having a long deep orgasm. Vicki slid off of my cock and laid next to me with her head on my chest and I held her tight. We stayed like this for almost half an hour hardly saying a word, I was caressing her head and back as she gently touched my stomach and groin area, just enjoying the feeling of our naked bodies together. She finally slid up and kissed me deeply, started stoking my cock and whispered in my ear, “Can you do it again, I want you to fuck me again” 

“I want nothing more in the world” I replied and kissed her again sliding my hand on her wet pussy, she spread her legs wide inviting me to give her pleasure. I easily slid two fingers into her inviting pussy, still stretched from receiving my cock, and I rubbed my thumb on her clit. She arched her back and let out a loud moan of pleasure, I moved my head down to her breasts and started sucking on her erect nipples. “I want your cock, bring it up here I can’t reach it, I want to suck your cock” she begged. I knelt with one leg on each side of her body and placed my half hard cock next to her inviting mouth. I reached my hand back down to her pussy and slid my fingers back into her making her moan as she grabbed my growing cock and slid it into her mouth. I propped her head up on a couple of pillows so I could drive my cock straight into her inviting mouth. I was not yet fully hard so Vicki was able to take more of my cock, I pushed my dick down into her mouth and held it still allowing her to take as much as she could handle and she was loving it. Sliding her mouth over my shaft and rubbing my cock and balls with her hands she was totally into my dick and wanted it all. All of the time I was persistent with fingering her pussy and rubbing her clit. Her satisfaction with this was growing I could tell from her intensifying moans while trying to swallow my cock. She finally released me from her mouth and yelled “Oh Fuck!!!” and came oozing juice all over my fingers. I thought to myself that I had never been with a woman that could orgasm so easily. 

By this time I was hard again and I wanted to fuck her tight pussy. I slid down her body and pushed her legs up and down towards her chest so she was bent in half and gave me clear access to her pussy for my now throbbing cock. She started up at me with her big blue eyes and muttered “Please fuck me, I want to feel all of you in me please give it to me” With that I slid my cock deep into her, not being so patient this time and driving my shaft in balls deep. She was so incredibly tight around my shaft and was so wet and warm, it was perfect. “Shit you are so big, give it to me I want it all, I can take it give it to me” she moaned but wincing as I drove slowly in and out of her. “Let me know if I hurt you and I will stop, but I am going to give you all of me” I said as I started pounding down into her sweet pussy. I was hitting her hard and giving her my full length, making loud slapping sounds of my body smacking down into her pussy. “Oh fuck yes, give me more don’t stop” she yelled as I thrust hard into her. “Keep going I want you to make me cum like this, oh fuck don’t stop” I kept pounding her I was dripping in sweat from my effort and she just kept urging me on until she let out a loud scream and came one more time. I collapsed down on her and kissed her, both of us sweaty and hot and with my big hard cock still inside of her. 

“Take me from behind, I bet that will make you cum” She said excitedly like making me cum again was a challenge. She rolled out from under me and positioned herself on her knees on the edge of the bed so I could stand behind her. Vicki’s ass is perfect especially from behind and her pussy was swollen and red, her hole gaping open from the repeated penetration of my cock. I stood behind her and shoved my big cock into her inviting pussy. “Oh yeah, fuck me that feels great fuck me give me you cum baby fuck me” she groaned as I drove hard into her, knowing that if I was going to cum again this is how I would be able to do it and I would have to give it to her hard and fast. “Pull my hair and spank me baby I want you to fuck me good” she demanded. I did as ordered and grabbed her long blonde hair into a pony tail and yanked back on her as I fucked her hard and slapped her on her ass until her cheek was red. I thought to myself this is the same woman that abstained from sex for over a month other than a couple of hand jobs and now she was getting wild and loved my hard fucking of her little pussy, I was surprised. 

“Cum in me come on give me your cum” she begged as I pulled on her hair and I pounded into her from behind. Finally after a few more minutes both of us now totally wet with sweat I released inside of her and collapsed on top of her on the bed. The rest of the night we showered again, I ate her pussy in the shower once again because she said it felt so good the first time and we went to bed in each other’s arms our naked bodies entwined as we slept. 

I woke in the morning alone in bed, naked and with my usual throbbing morning hard-on. I found my boxers and pants at the foot of the bed that I had left downstairs the night before. I slid on my boxers and that was it as it was warm in the apartment. I waited a moment and went in to the bathroom so my cock could get an opportunity to go down. I did not want to look like a total horn dog running down the stairs being led by my huge hard cock. 

I made my way downstairs where Vicki was standing in the kitchen waiting for coffee to brew and looking at her tablet. “Good morning, you look as beautiful as always” I said as I walked over and gave her a deep kiss. She looked up at me and smiled, and she did look beautiful and incredibly sexy. All she was wearing was my dress shirt from the night before, she had the sleeves rolled up and the top few buttons undone so she was covered walking around but I could get a quick glimpse of her naked breast when she moved. The shirt was big enough on her petite little body to go down to her knees. “What are you smiling at” she said giggling at me as I just started at her beauty and sexy little body. “You look so sexy in my shirt, I am such a lucky guy” I said as I walked to her, kissed her and put my hands around her thin waist. “Oh, thanks” she said blushing, “I guess you do find me sexy” she said as she reached down to my now hard cock”

She let go of me and boosted herself up on the counter and undid the bottom few buttons of the shirt and opened it up to give me a great view of her little tits and well groomed pussy. I moved in close to her and we kissed, I slid her ass to the edge of the counter which was the perfect height for me, I pulled down my boxers and slid my cock into her inviting warmth making her gasp in surprise, she was now getting use to my girth and she was dripping wet so my cock gained easy access to her warm wet hole. We kissed the entire time we fucked and I held one of her breasts and played with her nipple which she enjoyed so much. She reached a hand down and rubbed her clit and could feel my shaft sliding in and out of her. We fucked and she rubbed her clit until she came and she felt so good to me I never slowed for her through her orgasm. Vicki whispered in my ear “When you are ready I want to taste your cum, I want to swallow all of you” I said nothing, just kissed her and sped up my thrusting into her wetness. We never broke from our embrace for another couple of minutes until I knew I was going to explode. I pulled out of her and stepped back, Vicki jumped off of the counter and dropped to her knees as I stroked my cock. I released my cock when she grabbed it and placed it in her mouth driving me to completion shooting my full morning load into her mouth, making her gag but she swallowed every last drop and licked me clean. 

My shirt fell off of her shoulders to the floor when she stood up and we hugged, it felt so good to have her naked body pressed against me. “You still have your jewelry on, it looks great on you.” I said to her as I lifted her back up onto the counter. “Yeah, I love it, I am never going to take it off, and I will let everyone know that my boyfriend that I love so much gave it to me” Vicki said proudly. “Well your boyfriend loves you too. Who knows someday you might get a ring to match the set” I said before I realized what came out of my mouth. “That would be wonderful” she replied and kissed me. 

After a few months I had my divorce finalized with Debbie, it was very amicable as we were both in love with other people and just wanted to move forward with our lives. Vicki and I moved in together after I sold my house from my marriage. She was fantastic to livre with, she was constantly horny and wanted sex all of the time. It was hard to believe that we dated a while without sex because she was so crazy about fucking. We both liked to wake up early in the morning every day and fuck before we went to work. After living together for a month or so I proposed to her on Valentine’s day and we were married the following summer. All of the other women that I had over the past year were understanding of my relationship with Vicki and once they knew of our situation they accepted it.

I ran into Becky one night when we were out and she was now dating someone and was happy. Angela had gone through a few boyfriends, she is good friends with Vicki, and one drunken night she told her that she can’t find a guy with a cock big enough to make her happy. Lena is happily by herself and says found god, but still has Lisa spend the night with her every once in a while. Lisa said she does not feel guilty cheating on her husband when it is with another woman. Tina has found another guy to fuck her at lunch time, I can always tell when she comes back to work when she met with him. Sue is still a total slut, she is not shy about telling me of her sexual adventures and occasionally checks to make sure that I don’t want to fuck her with my big cock. Ashley is still a good friend of mine and she has found a boyfriend I will always watch out and care for her. I heard from Kim a couple of times after her move and she finally told me that she could not contact me anymore as it hurt her too much to talk to me and to not be with me. I wish her well and I hope she finds happiness. Katie got married, she found a guy from what I heard that has a good size dick and just wants oral sex. Katie fell in love. Christine took a job at another company a few weeks after the time we fucked and I never saw her again. Debbie and Linda were married a few months back, now that gay marriage was legalized in our state. They are both very happy we stay in touch on a regular basis. Yan was brought back to China by her parents and did not finish school here. She found such a taste for American cock that she was doing every guy she could on campus. She got pregnant and when her parents found out they brought her back home. Courtney finished school and got married right after graduation. She was fucking a 45 year old wealthy real estate developer that left his wife and kids for Courtney’s tight little ass, she is now a step mom to 15 and 13 year old boys. 

All of these women were such an experience and allot of fun, but I am so much happier with just Vicki, I could not ask for more. Besides that I don’t have ass prints and pussy juice on my desk anymore.

3omioc,4,2015-10-13,My second journey of weightloss,martindo,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3omioc/my_second_journey_of_weightloss/,"Hi guys! I'm starting this thread to have a place to drop my journey to my goal of 85~90kg.

**About myself**
I am a 20 year old student Computer Engineering currently fullfilling my internship at a Dutch company. Yes, I am from the Netherlands.

I've been the target of bullies for a long time (from age 7 to 15) and therefore grew up as a lonely guy. At an age of 15 I got my first real job at a neighborhood supermarket what really made me grew up and get an adult attitude at a young age. Having many conversations with all the customers made me a social guy. It is one of best experiences I've ever had and it made me who I am today. It lasted for five years (until my second realreal job as a software developer at another company for like two months).

**My first weightloss journey**
Last year I was around 100kg, my pants were getting a bit tight. That motivated me to lose 10kg. I did succeed by watching my food intake (mostly brown bread with chicken, wheyprotein, water instead of soda's) and just train 2~3 times a week.

**De-motivated**
Unfortenately, I lost my motivation and the 10kg came back as it was a boomerang. That was a bummer..

**MOTIVATION!**
A couple of weeks ago I was standing on the scale since a while... 107kg, I was a bit shocked. That is **not** what I want. So my plan: Lose 17kg.

**How?**
I've made a plan to go to the gym at: Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. Tuesday will be chest, abs and biceps. Thursday will be back, triceps. And Saturday will be the awesome legday.

I will try to cut my sugar intake and stop drinking soda's. Coffee will stay but will be reduced to three cups a day at a max. 

I will update this weekly as part of a motivation (and maybe check if I can get some online blog for myself, and maybe others)

**Stats** :
Starting weight: 107kg
Goal weight: 85~90kg
Length: 193cm (6'4"")

I just moved to Tallahassee about a month ago. I love the city and am so excited to be here.

There's just one problem. Something came up in the internship I moved here for and I may not be able to stay in it for much longer. I was expecting it to last through the end of April, and after it was over I would plan to look for a full-time or entry-level job. This sucks because I just moved into my apartment ten days ago and signed a lease which won't expire until July 31st of next year.

With that said, I have bills to pay and I need to find some kind of work if this falls through. Since I'm so new to the area, I haven't had a chance to meet people or plant roots, other than getting settled into my apartment. I just want advice on what would be the best course of action for me to take, what places are hiring, and how I can get my foot in the door.  I would like to make at least $1,000 after taxes if at all possible, working with friendly and upbeat people. That's a little less than what I'm making now in my internship. I have some money I can use as a buffer while I look for work but I have already invested quite a bit in this position. 

Sucks that this had to be my first real-world experience post-college but I want to head this thing off before I find myself lonely and jobless up here. Any advice/suggestions would help, and maybe some companionship as well. :)"
3on8d1,2,2015-10-13,An Unsent Letter to My Ex-GF (long read),beetmymeat,ExNoContact,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/3on8d1/an_unsent_letter_to_my_exgf_long_read/,"Hey Ex-Gf,


It’s been almost 2 months ever since you broke up with me, and to be honest I never thought that I would make it to this point. I’m actually focusing again on my classes, interviewing for medical schools soon, diet and exercise properly, and meeting lots of great, new people. My anxiety and depression are getting better each day, and my relationship with my family is much better than before. Honestly, life couldn’t be better.


But despite all of that, a part of me still misses you. Loves you. Wants to break no contact and forgive you for what you did to me. And I fucking hate it.


You betrayed my trust. When you went through your depressing “existential crisis” over the summer where you wanted to drop out of OT school and travel the world, felt like you had no friends, and got upset about your family issues, who shoulder was the one that you cried on? Mine. Even when I was busy studying my ass off for the MCAT, working multiple hours at clinic, doing graduate school courses, and completing a research project. Even on MY BIRTHDAY when you kept complaining about how shitty you felt like your life was getting, when I told you to visit friends in our college town that wanted to see you but you had no interest in them despite you COMPLAINING ABOUT NOT HAVING FRIENDS. I still put up with all of that bullshit. Why? Because I loved you. Because I cared for you.


Or how about a couple of your fake friends that actually did abandon you over the summer? When they left you because they would rather hang out with other crazy people? Who was there to take care of you for that?


Yet, in the end, when I needed you the most because of stress from my med school apps, from finding a grad school internship, from feeling distant from my parents and sister, from facing the fact that my grandfather isn’t going to live by next Christmas, from my anxiety and depression that I’ve been battling and trying to keep at bay TO KEEP YOU HAPPY, you jumped ship. You left when I was at the lowest point of my life. I understood and accepted my issues in the relationship, and was willing to work towards improving for myself, not just for the relationship itself.


But you didn’t want to compromise. You would’ve rather returned to your old lifestyle where you just went to music festivals, did tons of drugs, went to bars and parties, and hooked up with multiple guys. When you broke up with me, you seemed so relaxed and had no guilt in your eyes. The girl talking to me seemed like a completely different person. Instead, you wanted to just be friends because “you still cared about me,” and I was stupid enough to accept. That, along with everything else, devastated me…to the point that I couldn’t see happiness in life anymore and attempted suicide the night it ended.


I couldn’t sleep, eat, exercise, or think properly up to several days at a time. I remember that a few days after I left the mental institution and returned to classes, I felt terrified just being around my classmates and friends. I would cry when I got home because I was so scared that I would never be able to adjust to society again, while you were prancing around like nothing was wrong. Thankfully, my closest friends, family, and therapist served as an amazing support system for me. It made me realize what incredible people I have in my life, and that I truly am loved.


I’ve come to realize other things over the last few weeks. For one, you are an incredible selfish person, and I can’t tell if you’re that naïve about it or just ignore it on purpose. The fact that you had the audacity to tell one of our mutual friends to ask me to start talking to you, even though YOU KNOW what I went through, shows that you could give zero fucks about my recovery. You only care about your ego and ridding yourself of the guilt from the events that transpired. Furthermore, during our relationship, when you told me that you didn’t have the money to spend for our trip to New York that we planned THREE MONTHS AHEAD because you decided to blow most of it on music festivals that you didn’t even invite me to, that REALLY pissed me off. I wanted you to meet my family, especially my grandfather, who you knew was a very important person in my life and isn’t going to live for that much longer. But instead, you only thought about yourself.


Another thing that I realized is just how crazy you actually are. Yes, people say that about their ex’s all the time, but I, along with many others, am convinced that you are legitimately crazy. You always had this belief that everyone was “fucked up,” and I agreed simply because I was so blindly in love and agreed with you. Looking back, I can’t believe how wrong that statement is. Yes, everyone has their faults; we’re only human after all. But only a small percentage of the population is actually “fucked up” to certain degrees, some more than others. I feel like the reason you would say that is because those are the only people that you are/were used to growing up and interacting with. Your friends, your family, even the randoms that you would hang out with. And the worst part is that that was what you viewed as “normal,” and I was almost lost myself in that.


I don’t know when I’m going to forgive you. But when I do, I’m not forgiving you for you. I’m forgiving you to give myself peace and to ultimately move on from this. I know now that I have great things ahead of me in life, and this breakup was the best thing that happened to me in our relationship.


TL;DR: My ex is fucked up and it took me ~2 months to realize that. I’m on a solid road to recovery and a bright future (hopefully)."

Brief introduction:
So i'm 15 years old and have been wanting to get a 3D printer for my electronics project. A while back I met a group of cool guys on 3D Hubs who printed me my Raspberry Pi Portable case, and I asked for an internship with them. They accepted, and gladly taught me the basics (as well as a few pointers).

So now that i'm this far, I did about a few weeks' worth of research about printers, and I came across the Folger Tech Prusa i3 (the acrylic one). I realize that acrylic is weak and may break, however i'm pretty confident it won't (if it does I may get a new frame). So i've been taking a few sneak peeks for what i'm getting into by reading the assembly guide via the google drive link they provided. It doesn't seem very hard, and I am pretty good with electronics so I think i got that portion down.

The real part here that I need help with, is i've read a lot about z-leveling, bed stick, print quality, etc. Can you guys give me a few pointers for what to watch out for when I assemble this printer? How should I go about leveling the bed? How can I make sure vibration doesn't mess up my print? I'd just like some general advice.

Thanks guys."

We’re excited to host yet another RC in Southern California, this year at UCLA. We are expanding our programs in the West and plan to continue growing the student movement for liberty there. This year, we will be hosting more Regional Conferences than ever before with 24 North American conferences from coast to coast. These all-day Saturday events are organized by students, for students. Registration is free and includes two free meals and drinks at our evening socials. In addition to bringing home free books and t-shirts, students will gain a deeper understanding of the ideas of liberty, opportunities for professional advancement, and a network of like-minded people to support them in their future endeavors. Regional Conferences remind us that we aren’t alone and give us a rare opportunity to come together as a community to celebrate freedom.

Whether you’ve never heard of libertarianism or are a senior student leader for liberty, our fall regional conferences have something for you. For those new to the principles of classical liberalism, regional conferences are a great way to start exploring classical liberal thought. More advanced participants will have the opportunity to find summer internships and hone their activism skills. All student attendees are guaranteed to walk away from these events energized and inspired to get to work on their college campuses promoting the ideas of freedom.

3onqod,1,2015-10-13,"Me [20 M] with my girlfriend [21F] of two years, she has borderline personality disorder, i have issues too",confusedpersonn,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3onqod/me_20_m_with_my_girlfriend_21f_of_two_years_she/,"I've been with my girlfriend for two years now. When we met, I had just started college in a new city, had just moved in with a 32 year old alcoholic boyfriend I had only met twice in real life before, had serious social anxiety and dissociation stemming from my dad dying in a helicopter accident at age 12, and was very into smoking pot all day every day. 


I met her through a mutual internet friend, who directed her to me when she asked him if he knew any one with drugs. Everything started off so great, I got into psychedelic drugs and it really helped me work through my dad dying and my anxiety around it, I kicked out my alcoholic boyfriend for refusing to get a job or pay any rent, and she was there with me the whole time. She had been through some seriously rough things before meeting me. Had abusive parents, then abusive boyfriends, and then became a prostitute and attempted suicide multiple times. 


But I was totally in love with her, she was my first real relationship, and I was fucked up to, so we would work out our issues and live happily forever. About 6 months in we had a mushroom trip together that led her to realize a bunch of things about her life, her being forced into electrical engineering by her ultra conservative parents, her constantly smoking weed to cope, and lots of things. So after that she quit smoking weed, and I did because she did. 


Over the next few months I started really noticing some really crazy behavior. Before she got sober, we were having really crazy sex 1-3 times a day. Going to BDSM dungeons, crazy acid trips, all sorts of stuff. When she got sober, she developed vaginismus so sex got really hard. Now I know it is because all of the sexual trauma from being a prostitute and getting raped that she had been repressing with drugs all came back to her, but at the time she nor I knew what was going on. So we stopped having penatrative sex very often. At this time I started smoking weed again, but only when I wasn't with her, because I saw it as a recreational thing and not a big deal. 


Then we moved in together and things started to go downhill. I took the summer of, while she was taking some O chem classes for 6 hours a day Monday through Friday. Now that we were living together I really started to notice the mood swings, one minute she loved me and the next she hated me. and she was like that with everything, hyper emotional beyond belief. She was crazy depressed all the time and it was super hard to not get dragged down by it. I started smoking weed a few days a week while she was in class, because I thought it wasn't a big deal, and just didn't tell her about it because I was afraid of her reaction. Then we took MDMA together and I told her i sometimes smoked pot without telling her when she wasn't home and things have just gotten worse and worse.


She freaked out, and I genuinely thought it reallly wasn't that big of a deal. We had both been massive stoners in the past, it was by no means a priority to me, but I had really damaged the relationship. It took a long time for her to forgive me, and caused drugs to be a really awkward thing between us. I stopped drugs use, but I think it was here I started to resent her for not being cool with me getting stoned every now and then. She never explicitly told me to not smoke weed, but after that whenever I would it would make things very awkward between us and she'd get really aggressive and hostile towards me. So me, being a quiet person who really like to avoid all conflict, stopped taking drugs and just started internalizing anger towards her for it. A few months went by of me just being quiet and letting her have her way with everything because I was still in constant apology mode for the weed incident. 


I guess this is really where it started to get bad for me. I fell into a deep depression once we went back to school. I had no friends other than her, she was constantly either depressed or mean to me, and we couldnt have sex normally. Then I discovered I could buy benzodiazapines cheap on the internet, and they made me not give a shit about anything. So every 2-3 days I would take benzos without telling her and just escape reality. I know this was stupid. I am totally aware that drugs are not an effective coping skill, but at the time I was in a dark place and wanted to die most days but was too attached to her to leave. plus, I knew if we did break up, she would most likely go back to being a prostitute, drop out of college, and likely kill herself. I cared about her too much to let that happen, but I was so miserable with her that I justified hiding drug use as what I had to do to not go full crazy. This went on for a long time and my memory of that time is hazy. 


I actually ended up getting off benzos and going through minor withdrawals without her knowing. I remained miserable and spent lots of time crying in the bathroom. I started seeing a therapist again, who has been very helpful. It was then that I first heard about borderline personality disorder. The wikipedia page for BPD describes my gf to a T. I found a specialist for her and convinced her to go. She got into a DBT program and started making some progress, but I was still harboring resentment for everything she put me through. After having to stay completely sober for a pre employment drug test, I started smoking weed everyday again. This time however, I just flat told her that I like to smoke weed when I finish everything I do for the day, it helps me sleep, it calms me down at the end of the day, and I prioritize my work above it. All of that is true, I got high almost everyday (usually around 6-9 pm) and still managed to get 4.0 gpa, an awesome internship, and got offered a TA position by a professor I really admired. I still was angry at her, but I couldnt really understand why. I didnt know I had all the anger of the previous year still bottled up inside me. I ended up ordering some benzos off the internet again once I started working. I would take them at work occasionally at normal doses when I had to give presentations and whatnot. 


Then, one day I decide to take one pill before work. It turns out the pills were made by some stupid drug dealer who cant dose a pill evenly, and I blacked out shortly after getting to work. I don't remember anything till the next morning. I tell my gf about the benzos, but only about how I recently got some and took it at work, not about the past addiction.  This basically undid any and all progress we had made in the past year since the weed incident, plus made everything 100x worse. I stopped all drug use again, and then I finally started being able to identify my resentment. we almost broke up, and part of me really wanted it to just end so i could move on, but we stayed together. 


Since then I have really developed some actual coping skills, and have really improved my communication. I cut benzos 100% out of my life, but currently smoke pot most days at the end of the day. I make sure to never use drugs as an escape or when I am upset, and have been overall much healthier. I worked through my resentment, and we've been seeing a couples therapist, but all of this has made me so tired. I find myself thinking about being single, about not having to deal with all the problems my gf and I share together. She is still extremely depressive all of the time, and it is really hard for me to not get pulled into it. I am much more aware of her triggers and how to avoid them, but having to constantly be on guard is not fun. Sometimes I completely love her, but other times I just get depressed and couldn't care less about the relationship. It just cycles over and over again and I am afraid that if i stay with her my life will be a constant cycle of depression and okayness.


I know I've done some really shitty things to an already hurt person. I am totally aware of that. It was not cool to do drugs behind he back. I just want to move forward and have things be happy between us again. When I think about the amazing times we had together and the real connection we share, I want to stay together, but all of the bad stuff has really confused me. 


I really dont have a concrete question. If anyone has any advice I would love to hear it. I havent really talked to anyone other than my therapist about this, as I dont really have any friends (something im trying really hard to change). what would you do? is there just a compatibility issue between us? I wish I could just tell her the whole story, but if I did I know that would be the end of it. I'm sorry for writing such a rambling post, I just dont know what to do.


   
**tl;dr**: gf has bpd, i hid drugs from her, lots of drama, dont know if i should stay or leave?"
3oo8c8,129,2015-10-13,The Night Out and the Neckbeard,Fatguytinybike,neckbeardstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/neckbeardstories/comments/3oo8c8/the_night_out_and_the_neckbeard/,"I've been loving this sub, so I'll contribute my story. 

This happened about a month or so  back.  

The list of characters:

Me: 33. Brick shaped. 225#, 5'9"". 
Wifey: 32. Tall, pretty and well proportioned. 6'0"". Out of my league, but she still married me. 
Wifey's friend: Friend of wifey. Female.  Coworker of wifey. 
The Neckbeard: stereotype beard. Early  20's.  We'll call him ""Steve"".  Will be described in the text. 

It starts (for me) one Friday night after I get off work. Wifey calls me to tell me that the kiddos are at the in laws house, and we are going out to have some drinks! Sweet! Apparently, wifey's friend and her made a plan to go out to a local craft beer bar to do a tasting. I get to do grown up stuff, and I didn't have to plan!

I get home, ditch the uniform, and throw on a pair of jeans and a t shirt, and pull on a pair of comfortable adidas sambas. Not a fancy night out, so I dress like it. Wifey's wearing jeans, and a fairly conservative but nice looking top. A little makeup. Some jewelry, but again, nothing fancy. 

We arrive at the beer bar. Friend of wifey arrives near simultaneously.  We enter the bar. Wifey and friend come to a dead stop. Wifey is wide eyed. I soon see what has perturbed them so...

In the back corner, there is a huge solitary figure sitting, drinking. I pay no mind, but I see what they're looking at. He's big, huge. From what I can see, he's wearing what appears to be a black button down shirt, vest (dark colored) and shorts and a fedora. Humorous to me, but it doesn't trip my threat meter. 

We get a booth and start looking at the list of beers. I ask what the deal is, and they explain that this fellow, Steve, is an intern in the IT department at their work. He is known to be kind of a creep. He is looking in our direction, but stays put. For the moment. 

I head to the bar and get the first round of drinks. While I was gone, Stevie has approached the booth and dragged his chair over as well. Upon my return, I get the full picture of this man beast.   What I saw before came in focus: Black shirt, pin striped vest, black tie, plaid fedora, and what had believed to be shorts turned out to be a kilt. Yep, kilt.  His hair, what I can see of it, is dyed black, long in back and greasy looking. He appears to have either attempted to grow a beard, or to have glued patches of pubes to his face.  He is probably 6'3"" or so, and I'd estimate 375-400 pounds of cookie dough. He is also sweaty and drunk. He smells like cheap cologne and BO. He is a winner. 

I get back to the booth and he moves to physically block me from entering. Stevo asks loudly, ""and who might you be?"", as if I was a fat drunk weirdo that self invited himself to a night out. I answer, ""I'm Fatguy. Wifey's husband.""  I shoot my hand out for a handshake, and instantly regretted the decision. His paw was damp, almost oily. He shook my hand but had a look on his face like I was below his station.  He moves, I resume my seat. 

My wife is a wonderful woman. If she has one flaw, it's that she is too damn nice. The things she'll put up with never cease to amaze me. She is visibly, at least to me, uncomfortable. So is friend of wifey. Steve heaves his girth from the poor chair and goes to get more beer.  I ask if she wants to leave. She says no, that we should give him a chance. 

He returns. He asks me what I'm drinking. I tell him it's an imperial IPA. He replies, ""that's nice. I'm drinking stout. Real men drink stout"".  He asks what brought us out that night, and wifey replied that we just wanted to go out for a good time. He replies, ""cool, I've been coming here for years! I love this place!""  This is interesting to me. This place has been open for just over a year at this point. I know that prior to the bar, this place was vacant for a couple of years, and prior to that, it was a health food store. I call him on his bullshit. ""I used to go to the other location.  Before they moved"", was his response. I've been going there since they opened. I know the owners. I know for a fact that it is the first and only location. I call him on that and he tells me that I don't know what I'm talking about. 

He tells wifey that she is beautiful.  He then rants about how he would love a woman like her, and that he would be a powerful lover if given a chance. Cannot understand why he is still a virgin, and why women will not give him a chance. He tells her that he can't understand why women would be attracted to guys who just can't put any effort into the way they dress.  He declares his love for wifey and friend of wifey.  All of this is spoken directly to wifey's boobs. He is warned that if the conversation is to continue, he will need to behave civilly. 

He leads the conversation. By lead, I mean dominate. His idea of conversation seems to be based on the idea that we should all know about why he is a libertarian/atheist/conspiratard and how we are wrong for not agreeing with his worldview. Friend of wifey leaves, as she is tired of the shitshow and has to be up early. Wifey and I stay, as we are amazed by the shitshow. It was like performance art. From this, we learn that Masons are evil. So are Jews. And something about dustification and 9/11.  We got him good and riled up.  So much crazy, so much misunderstanding of history/physics/logic. Finally blurts out that he did in fact come out because he overheard the conversation between wifey and her friend. Wifey and I have had three beers each. He has had at least four beers, and a couple pitchers, plus whatever he had before we got there.  

He gets another pitcher of stout and one glass. He proceeds to get more shithoused. Wifey suggests he try some water. He states ""ERM NOT DRUNK. YURR TOO SORBOR"". He then leans back in the poor, overstrained chair, and it gives way. He falls backwards and lands, splay legged. He is apparently wearing his kilt ""proper"", sans underpants. He is passed out at this point. I check his pulse, and check to see if he busted his head open. He's good, just passed out drunk. I pull his kilt down to cover his junk, because nobody needs or wants to see that. We leave when he comes to, and is kicked out of the bar. 

We go home wondering what the hell we just saw. 

Follow up: Wifey told me that he tried to play it off as a big gag. That he wasn't that drunk, obnoxious, or weird. He wound up getting fired from his internship about a week later. He was caught trying to steal a projector. 
 

There you have it. My Neckbeard story."
3oogue,1,2015-10-13,An Unsent Letter to My Ex-Gf (long but thoughts appreciated),beetmymeat,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3oogue/an_unsent_letter_to_my_exgf_long_but_thoughts/,"Hey Ex-Gf,


It’s been almost 2 months ever since you broke up with me, and to be honest I never thought that I would make it to this point. I’m actually focusing again on my classes, interviewing for medical schools soon, diet and exercise properly, and meeting lots of great, new people. My anxiety and depression are getting better each day, and my relationship with my family is much better than before. Honestly, life couldn’t be better.


But despite all of that, a part of me still misses you. Loves you. Wants to break no contact and forgive you for what you did to me. And I fucking hate it.


You betrayed my trust. When you went through your depressing “existential crisis” over the summer where you wanted to drop out of OT school and travel the world, felt like you had no friends, and got upset about your family issues, who shoulder was the one that you cried on? Mine. Even when I was busy studying my ass off for the MCAT, working multiple hours at clinic, doing graduate school courses, and completing a research project. Even on MY BIRTHDAY when you kept complaining about how shitty you felt like your life was getting, when I told you to visit friends in our college town that wanted to see you but you had no interest in them despite you COMPLAINING ABOUT NOT HAVING FRIENDS. I still put up with all of that bullshit. Why? Because I loved you. Because I cared for you.


Or how about a couple of your fake friends that actually did abandon you over the summer? When they left you because they would rather hang out with other crazy people? Who was there to take care of you for that?


Yet, in the end, when I needed you the most because of stress from my med school apps, from finding a grad school internship, from feeling distant from my parents and sister, from facing the fact that my grandfather isn’t going to live by next Christmas, from my anxiety and depression that I’ve been battling and trying to keep at bay TO KEEP YOU HAPPY, you jumped ship. You left when I was at the lowest point of my life. I understood and accepted my issues in the relationship, and was willing to work towards improving for myself, not just for the relationship itself.


But you didn’t want to compromise. You would’ve rather returned to your old lifestyle where you just went to music festivals, did tons of drugs, went to bars and parties, and hooked up with multiple guys. When you broke up with me, you seemed so relaxed and had no guilt in your eyes. The girl talking to me seemed like a completely different person. Instead, you wanted to just be friends because “you still cared about me,” and I was stupid enough to accept. That, along with everything else, devastated me…to the point that I couldn’t see happiness in life anymore and attempted suicide the night it ended.


I couldn’t sleep, eat, exercise, or think properly up to several days at a time. I remember that a few days after I left the mental institution and returned to classes, I felt terrified just being around my classmates and friends. I would cry when I got home because I was so scared that I would never be able to adjust to society again, while you were prancing around like nothing was wrong. Thankfully, my closest friends, family, and therapist served as an amazing support system for me. It made me realize what incredible people I have in my life, and that I truly am loved.


I’ve come to realize other things over the last few weeks. For one, you are an incredible selfish person, and I can’t tell if you’re that naïve about it or just ignore it on purpose. The fact that you had the audacity to tell one of our mutual friends to ask me to start talking to you, even though YOU KNOW what I went through, shows that you could give zero fucks about my recovery. You only care about your ego and ridding yourself of the guilt from the events that transpired. Furthermore, during our relationship, when you told me that you didn’t have the money to spend for our trip to New York that we planned THREE MONTHS AHEAD because you decided to blow most of it on music festivals that you didn’t even invite me to, that REALLY pissed me off. I wanted you to meet my family, especially my grandfather, who you knew was a very important person in my life and isn’t going to live for that much longer. But instead, you only thought about yourself.


Another thing that I realized is just how crazy you actually are. Yes, people say that about their ex’s all the time, but I, along with many others, am convinced that you are legitimately crazy. You always had this belief that everyone was “fucked up,” and I agreed simply because I was so blindly in love and agreed with you. Looking back, I can’t believe how wrong that statement is. Yes, everyone has their faults; we’re only human after all. But only a small percentage of the population is actually “fucked up” to certain degrees, some more than others. I feel like the reason you would say that is because those are the only people that you are/were used to growing up and interacting with. Your friends, your family, even the randoms that you would hang out with. And the worst part is that that was what you viewed as “normal,” and I was almost lost myself in that.


I don’t know when I’m going to forgive you. But when I do, I’m not forgiving you for you. I’m forgiving you to give myself peace and to ultimately move on from this. I know now that I have great things ahead of me in life, and this breakup was the best thing that happened to me in our relationship.


TL;DR: My ex is fucked up and it took me ~2 months to realize that. I’m on a solid road to recovery and a bright future (hopefully)"
3oohub,2,2015-10-14,"Dealing with not seeing each other for months on end, and now plans for visiting don't seem as set in stone as they once were",leavemyvoiceonthesea,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/3oohub/dealing_with_not_seeing_each_other_for_months_on/,"Hi there r/longdistance!

So my SO, 24m, and I, 21f, met while I was on a study abroad in Peru, and had an amazing time together in his country. We decided to continue the relationship, with plans being for us to be reunited after I graduate from college in May.

As December has been approaching, we've both been working to try to see each other. However, he got a new job with an American company where he travels a lot. Though the company said they were planning on sending him to the US for more training, they still don't know when. He's been very busy travelling, working long hours. We haven't been able to talk as much as before the job change because of conflicting schedules, and it's beginning to take a toll on our relationship.

Our original plan, which we made when I was still in Peru, was for him to come to visit me in December. However, he is now unsure whether he will be able to take off work for the holidays, as his company has set a precedent with filling up his previously scheduled break time with last-minute deadlines. He talked with his direct manager and got an approval, and sent an email to human resources and his higher up boss about getting the vacation time approved and get a visa for travel to the US. He still hasn't heard back.

I've been looking forward to his visit since I left him at the end of July, and coming to terms with it not necessarily being able to happen how we planned has been heartbreaking. My boyfriend posed an alternative in which he would pay for my airfare to go to Peru over the holidays if he hasn't heard back from HR and his higher up boss by the end of the month. However, this would complicate my family's holiday plans and make them suspicious of his and my motives. I want to see him more than anything in the world, but I don't know if this plan B has any chance of ever working out.

It's so hard not really knowing exactly when we're going to see each other again. Every day he and I talked about seeing each other in December, and now the possibility of that dream not happening is killing me. He says he's doing everything he can, but it's so hard to believe that this has a chance of working out. I'm also working towards getting an internship or job in his country after graduation, but it's a long time to not see each other in person, especially when we don't get to talk for as much time anymore except on the rare days he gets off.

How can I stay more positive about our relationship's future? My boyfriend is an amazing guy, and I don't want to lose him."

3ooktb,11,2015-10-14,List of scientific sources in peer-reviewed journals for possible LoA evidence,[deleted],lawofattraction,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofattraction/comments/3ooktb/list_of_scientific_sources_in_peerreviewed/,"Bold highlights added.

**General**

[Constructive and Unconstructive Repetitive Thought](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2672052/)

Psychol Bull. 2008 Mar; 134(2): 163–206. 

&gt; There is also a growing literature indicating how RT **[repetitive thought]** can be adaptive, functional, and beneficial, although, as noted earlier, the constructive consequences of RT have been less investigated than the unconstructive consequences of RT. The relevant studies are summarized in Table 2. The main emergent findings are that RT is implicated in (a) successful cognitive processing and recovery from upsetting and traumatic events, (b) adaptive preparation and planning for the future, (c) recovery from depression, and (d) uptake of health-promoting behaviors.

[Metaphysics of the tea ceremony: A randomized trial investigating the roles of intention and belief on mood while drinking tea](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24199774)

&gt; One randomly assigned group blindly received tea that had been intentionally treated by three Buddhist monks; the other group blindly received untreated tea from the same source. On the last day of the test, each person indicated what type of tea he/she believed he/she had been drinking.

&gt; ...

&gt; **Tea treated with good intentions improved mood more than ordinary tea derived from the same source.** Belief that one was drinking treated tea produced a large improvement in mood, but only if one was actually drinking the treated tea, indicating that belief and intentional enhancement interact. This also suggests that the esthetic and intentional qualities associated with the traditional tea ceremony may have subtle influences that extend beyond the ritual itself.

[Can we help just by good intentions? A meta-analysis of experiments on distant intention effects.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22784339)

J Altern Complement Med. 2012 Jun;18(6):529-33. doi: 10.1089/acm.2011.0321.

&gt; The hypothesis of the positive effect of benevolent intentions is supported by the data presented.

[Gut feelings, intuition, and emotions: an exploratory study.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15750366)

J Altern Complement Med. 2005 Feb;11(1):85-91.

EGG activity increases in response to the emotions of a distant person, beyond the influence of ordinary sensory interactions. 

[Event-related electroencephalographic correlations between isolated human subjects.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15165412)

J Altern Complement Med. 2004 Apr;10(2):315-23.

&gt; Under certain conditions, t**he EEG of a sensorially isolated human subject can become correlated with event-related potentials in a distant person's EEG**. This suggests the presence of an unknown form of energetic or informational interaction.

**Healing, prayer**

[The efficacy of ""distant healing"": a systematic review of randomized trials](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10836918).

Ann Intern Med. 2000 Jun 6;132(11):903-10.

&gt; Of the 23 studies, 13 (57%) yielded statistically significant treatment effects [...] The methodologic limitations of several studies make it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the efficacy of distant healing. However, given that **approximately 57% of trials showed a positive treatment effect**, the evidence thus far merits further study.

[Effects of remote, retroactive intercessory prayer on outcomes in patients with bloodstream infection: randomised controlled trial](http://www.bmj.com/content/323/7327/1450)

BMJ 2001;323:1450 

&gt; **Remote, retroactive intercessory prayer said for a group is associated with a shorter stay in hospital and shorter duration of fever in patients** with a bloodstream infection and should be considered for use in clinical practice.

[Possible effects of healing intention on cell cultures and truly random events](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15029876)

J Altern Complement Med. 2004 Feb;10(1):103-12.

&gt; Results were consistent with the postulate that **healing intention, applied repeatedly in a given location, may alter or condition that site so as to enhance the growth of treated cell cultures compared to untreated controls**.

[The effect of intercessory prayer on wound healing in nonhuman primates.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17131981)

Altern Ther Health Med. 2006 Nov-Dec;12(6):42-8.

&gt; Following IP/L-tryptophan treatment, **prayer-group animals had a reduction in wound size compared to non-prayer animals (P=.028).** Prayer-group animals had a greater increase in red blood cells (P=.006), hemoglobin (P=.01), and hematocrit (P=.018); a greater reduction in both mean corpuscular hemoglobin (P=.023) and corpuscular volume (P=.008); and a reduction in wound grooming (P=.01) and total grooming behaviors (P=.04) than non-prayer-group animals."
3op1w9,43,2015-10-14,I don't like talking to my parents anymore and it makes me feel terrible,bombay2beijing,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/3op1w9/i_dont_like_talking_to_my_parents_anymore_and_it/,"Hey bros. So I came out to my parents a week before I left to study abroad. Being very religious they said they could not accept or understand me being gay. My mom and brother asked me to see a counselor or pastor to figure out why I was having this problem and my dad just refused to believe it was true. I told them before I left to hopefully give them some time to come to terms with it while I'm very far away. My mom says to not make it ""public"" because her and my dad don't want to have to ""answer the questions people will ask"". I told her that one day she might have to choose between her current religious beliefs of me being sick and wrong and her love for her son and want of him in her life, and she replied ""if you're asking me to choose between my God and you then that's no choice"" ~with clear implications she chooses her faith. Before I left the last words my mom and dad told me in tears were ""we love you, but we can't accept this"". Now, I'm having a really great semester abroad but communication with my parents has been pretty dead. I talk to my mom every other week or so and I've only talked to my dad once. The issue of me being gay has not been brought up at all besides my mom texting me once saying ""I'm still praying for you, and always will be"". At this point I feel such a huge disconnect between my parents and me that I don't have any motivation at all to call or message them. When they message me I can feel the elephant in the room and I don't feel like keeping the conversation going. I always thought we were a pretty close family growing up, and this feeling of not wanting any contact with them makes me feel like a really shitty person and that maybe I'm making things even worse. Do you guys have any advice? I don't think my parents will be able to choose between their church family and religious beliefs and me, and me asking them to in a way feels unfair. Also, I've been supporting myself through internships and loans throughout all of college and whenever I tell my parents they might should save so they can help me after my internship money runs out they just tell me to ""save more"". The combination of not accepting me and no financial support (started even before I came out) really makes me have little interest in talking to them and makes me upset to go back home when this semester abroad ends. Sorry that this turned out to be a really long post, but any help or advice would be really appreciated :)"

My girlfriend is evaluating a new job offer and may have jumbled some of the initial steps and surrendered some of her negotiating power. I'm hoping you can help us navigate this and make up for lost ground.

Here's some background: we graduated in 2013 and since then she's been working for over two years as a research coordinator at one of the top research clinics in the world. 

Unfortunately, this is a public clinic that, due to their name recognition, has no shortage of top candidates wanting to work there. Most of them use the position to get more experience before pursuing a PHD or other advanced degree. These factors mean their salaries are pretty low. Right now GF makes less than $35k, and this is after raises and promotions. None of her peers make much more than this (many of them less), and there aren't many opportunities for advancement. 

Money is getting tight, so she's started to look for outside opportunities. She found a really good opportunity, but in her initial phone interview she was a bit flustered and made the mistake of divulging her current salary. The company said her compensation will likely wind up ""mid forties"", to which she responded ""Ok."" This was reiterated in her in-person interview, where she also merely responded ""ok."" 

I know, I know, but she's never had to really even interview for a job before (she got her first one through an internship) and it all moved a lot quicker than she was expecting, so she didn't have the chance to practice any of the steps for negotiating. 

She hasn't received an offer yet, but it's looking very likely. Is it totally too late to negotiate for more salary? What can she do to get the best offer without making it seem like she's squeezing them or going back on her initial interest/ acceptance of what they were offering?

Any advice is greatly appreciated!"

3oqzj1,4,2015-10-14,In a rough patch,ThisIsMyNewUserID,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3oqzj1/in_a_rough_patch/,"TL;DR
Landed in financial hotseat due to fiancée health issues and have no way to get out so I feel like a total loser who doesn’t deserve the wonderful woman he has and is thankful for.

Unabridged:

I'm a 34 year old chronic underachiever who may actually read like an overachiever on paper but feels like a HUMONGOUS loser in reality.  My entire youth I was “the smart kid.”  Always got good grades without trying all the way through high school etc.  I got a ton of scholarship offers to a bunch of pretty prestigious colleges but, due to the still exorbitant cost of attending some of those schools I chose a local school with a super-aggressive program to get an MBA in 3 years, during which you would also intern at several local major businesses.  I crashed and burned.  HARD.  

College was a completely different beast than anything I’d tried to undertake.  I couldn’t wrap my brain around the concept of studying since I never had to do it before.  I figured “it can’t be that much harder than high school or the standardized testing” but it was.  I had some personal health stuff on the side that caused me to miss a couple weeks during my first semester that put me even further behind.  Ultimately my scholarship was dropped after 1 semester and my family couldn’t afford the tuition otherwise.  Plus I still didn’t know how to college, so I figured I’d go to a junior college to teach myself how to learn at the next level and, at first, it worked!  I excelled in JuCo, but I had another setback after a year.  Destroyed my knee playing basketball and had to have surgery that left me unable to get around easily for a while, so I took another semester off.  I did go back, however, and despite it taking longer than I expected, I cleared Juco with the number of credits I wanted to transfer to uni, so I did.

I failed again.  This time it was one class and it was a clerical error that resulted in an F instead of a W but still, it was there.  I was so burnt out on the bad luck that I figured I’d take a semester off.  That “semester off” turned into two, which turned into a year, which turned into me being 34 years old with no degree.  I’ve done pretty well in my career, however, despite that.  I’ve never really run into a problem in the professional world I couldn’t solve relatively easy.  It’s been like high school again.  I’ve had a few promotions and raises over the years and have a solid senior level position usually reserved for folks with at least an undergrad at a fortune 100 company.  So while I’ve always felt like I could achieve much more given how easily 99% of what I’ve ever attempted came to me, I’m probably farther ahead than I should be based on my education level.  The loser part requires a bit more storytime.

During all that stuff I talk about above I remained mostly single.  I had a couple little flings here and there but never anything serious.  Until 4 years ago.  She was a friend of a friend who commented on one of my comments on facebook and we immediately hit it off and never looked back.  She’s the nicest, funniest, most kind and genuine person I’d ever met.  From the jump we found that we had a billion things in common.  One of the things we unfortunately had in common, however, was that we’re kinda cursed health-wise.  I won’t bother you with the stories behind all my stuff that I mentioned above because I’m fine today, but her ailments are important going forward in this novel-length posting.   The bad luck started in November 2012.  

Her and I had been together for a little over a year, had bought a home, and were both making pretty decent money.  We were putting money away for our lives together and I felt how I assumed a “real man” would always feel.  A good provider, a strong moral center, a rock against which my family could lean.  Until her father passed away in November 2012.  He was 60, and he was the light of her life.  Freak brain tumor.  He’d not been 100%, or probably even 50%, for a while but no one saw his death coming when it did, and she tried to take something positive from the tragedy and make some changes to her life and career that she’d put off before.  

The career change paid a LOT less, but it was more rewarding, and at the time as I mentioned we were in a good spot.  I opened a credit card for emergency money while we adjusted and it started to get a little use, as we expected it would, but nothing crazy.  Then she started having health issues.  Initially, she had a super sore and stiff shoulder.  We went to a chiropractor and paid a buttload of money that ultimately lead to no change other than the balance of our credit card.  Then we went to her GP who diagnosed her with a frozen shoulder.  She’s a type 1 diabetic and that is a condition more common in type 1 diabetics than “normal” folk which required very expensive physical therapy which also lead to no change other than the balance of our credit card.  Her GP then recommended we have a “surgical” procedure known as a manipulation performed.  We’d find out after the procedure that the surgeon she recommended, and that we used, was in fact NOT in our insurance network.  At least the shoulder was fixed.  Our credit card balance was getting a bit overbearing, however, so she took a different job that paid more.  My car also crapped out completely so we had to add a car payment and higher insurance to our already SUPER tight budget.  And that credit card balance grew as interest piled up.  

Then her health issues compounded.  One day out of nowhere she started seeing a sheathe of black  dots in her vision in one eye.  Ended up being Diabetic Retinopathy.  She was 32.  THIRTY FREAKIN TWO!  She’s never been the best diabetic but she had never been hospitalized and was still one of her endo’s best patients, so it was just dumb bad luck.  She had multiple laser procedures and two vitrectomies on that eyeball before she had could see again.  However, she’d just started a new job and didn’t have PTO to cover the time she had to miss due to the procedures and she was denied Short Term Disability so her pay went from low to zero for about a month.  So our credit card balance grew again.  Then our house payment went up because we had an escrow shortage.  We had 3 months of her going to work regularly with normal vision before the other eye became encumbered with black dots.  Another laser procedure.  More missed work without PTO.  More credit card debt.  Then her legs started to hurt.  

More doctors, more bills, more debt.  She ended up being diagnosed with Superficial Venous reflux which will require Radio Frequency Ablation and she’ll need another vitrectomy on what was once her good eye.  Our finances are now in shambles.  I can’t afford the minimum payment on our credit cards, of which we now have multiple.  My job transferred me 50 miles away with no choice to work remotely so I went from having about $20 extra per check to zero and I overdraft on weeks I have to fill up my gas tank because I know that my bank will pay it even if I don’t have it and charge me a fee.  I can’t afford to buy lunch on days when I don’t have one to pack, however, and I refuse to rack up more OD fees for that.  There are days we eat bread and butter for dinner.  We already have a home equity loan out that I can barely cover from when our finances were healthy.  Our house is in dire need of repairs we can’t afford and my credit is all of a sudden shot due to all the medical bills and credit card debt.  I’ve been behind on every recurring bill at least once over this hard time except the mortgage, but it looks like I won’t have enough by the 15th this time.  I’m $400 short and it’s due tomorrow.  And I don’t know how to tell her.

I’m not the man I was when we met.  I’m no longer a provider.  I cry myself to sleep most nights when I think about her slowly deprecating vision or having pain in her legs for the rest of her life and the fact that my failure as a provider is causing her even more stress on top of all that.  Since I don’t have that degree I have no leverage for a raise at work and no prospects for a new job.  My current job also works me RIDICULOUS hours so I don’t have time to get a part time job on the side.  I see no way out of this hole short of bankruptcy but I can’t really afford to have 7 years of no credit while it gets sorted at my age.  I can’t afford to invest in myself to improve our situation by getting a degree or certifications.  I have no prospects for side money of any significance short of a couple ideas for novels but I’m a shit writer and odds of those producing any significant income if I could figure out how to write something that wasn’t entirely boring and uninspiring are super low so it’s probably better to try to think of things that can actually make a difference.  So far I can’t think of anything, however.  I’m trying hard to stay positive and convince myself that, together, we make enough money to get past this if we hunker down and that this too shall pass but I struggle to see it since I can’t even afford minimum payments on our credit cards.  If something happens requiring emergency money we’re just SOL since I can’t get a loan and her job pays shit so our debt to income is horrible.  I’m constantly worried about that, and everything else.

We do still have each other, and our relationship is still as strong as ever, so that is uplifting, but literally everything else sucks.  I feel like she deserves better.  She deserves the “me” she met.  I am not as advertised and I hate that.  And I just wanted to get all that off my chest.  Thanks for reading."

It's fine if I don't get an internship I guess, I'll just keep working on my projects and getting good grades. But I'm very worried that when I graduate, I'm going to face the same issue of not getting callbacks, but this time with applying for actual jobs.

3or5mk,0,2015-10-14,"(24F) getting over breakup with (26M), possible emotional abuse/manipulation?",throwitaway726,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/3or5mk/24f_getting_over_breakup_with_26m_possible/,"Hi everyone! I feel like I'm in a good place overall, but I guess I was just wondering about how to deal with some aftermath in the relationship that I got out of a couple months ago.

Basically, I was with this guy for 3 years and things started off really well and it wasn't until probably about...2.5 years in that I was having serious doubts about our relationship. I don't want to go into too much detail since a lot of it is pretty specific, but...after a couple months of back and forth, we broke up. I instigated, he obviously wasn't happy.

He wanted to keep in contact for a while afterwards - partly because we had a month left on the lease in our apartment (the two of us plus my roommate) and partly because he wanted to ""make a couple more good memories with us"" before I left (internship in another state). So it was 3-4 weeks of us still sort of acting like we were dating, with me going back and forth on  ""was this the right choice to break up with him?"", as well as being able to act normal and feeling awfully down and then he'd be all ""you don't look happy to see me!"" (no shit, sherlock.)

So I moved out and felt better almost immediately, within 2 or 3 days realizing I'd ABSOLUTELY made the right choice. I came back to that state to see some friends before leaving for my internship, and he and I connected once or twice to talk some things over. I thought we sort of left on a good note, but he emailed me a couple times with things I'd done that made him mad in the recent past. 

Maybe it's my fault I originally told him I wanted to be friends, but I guess I didn't know how to go back on that. But I also kept telling him ""if we want to be friends, we need to have some space."" and he kept saying ""no, you can't just stop talking to someone who was such an important part of your life and then expect to be good friends afterwards."" so he kept initiating contact, though he tried to keep it light for my sake (aka no relationship talk). 

Finally, he emailed me saying he needed a break for a bit until we felt better about our situation. I was relieved. And then recently, he emailed me telling me he'd had time to think and he wanted no further contact with me, that I'd been emotionally abusive, and he hoped me and my friends would enjoy knowing I'd destroyed another person's life. 

I didn't really know how to respond to this - not to him (he made it clear that I shouldn't respond) but rather, as a self-reflection. Part of me was horrified - was I really emotionally abusive? After thinking for a couple minutes, I ended up calling one of my friends, who sort of helped me realize that he had managed to manipulate a lot of the situations (that he didn't know all the facts of for some of them) into making it my fault. Also, he clearly doesn't know my friends very well if he thinks that we laugh about destroying people's lives. What the actual fuck. (and one of the friends he named, I'm not even that close to...)

So I guess I've finally made it to my question. Overall, I'm thrilled knowing he's not in my life anymore. I didn't realize how much it was weighing on me until I realized I was grinning like an idiot walking to the store after reading the email. He's gone. I don't have to worry about what he's going to say to make me feel awful about myself. I can start fresh. I can be happy again (he was so fucking negative...)!

The main thing I'm mad about is that I can't defend myself against anything he said. I've told two or three friends about it, and they've listened to me and helped me sort of build my case about how he manipulated everything and some shit he did that was borderline abusive, but somehow I want to defend myself still. Maybe it's because I know I can't tell him? How can I ""come to terms"" with this?

My second question is maybe a bit weird. In telling some friends about things that he did, it kinda sounds like he was either manipulative or minorly emotionally abusive or something. I took the quiz on LoveIsRespect.org about having a healthy relationship and got over the ""normal/healthy"" score into the ""unhealthy"" range. But I don't know...it feels weird to call it abuse. I guess none of you can know for sure since I have left out a LOT of details. I know there wasn't hitting or name calling or anything; nothing outright. So it feels strange to label it that way. And yet I feel like I want to label it somehow...I don't know if that makes sense.


The other thing he said was that I never did anything for him other than sex/physical stuff. Which I guess is true, but near the end it's not like I wanted to do anything for him. But I guess...what sort of thing would he be looking for? I know that's a stupid question and maybe it's showing my inexperience in relationships, but...what sort of things do people do in relationships that, when their partners ask ""what exactly do you do for me"", they can say ""oh, I do this and this and this."" It kinda seems like a dumb question to me. But again, maybe I'm just...selfish or inexperienced or something?

So maybe my questions are: 1) How do I deal with wanting to defend myself? Is this something that will go away in time? 2) does it matter if it was emotionally abusive or not? how can I go forward making sure I'm NOT? and 3) what do you do in a relationship, besides physical stuff, ""for"" your partner?

sorry if this is a jumbled mess. I'm still sorting things out a bit. :P thank you for reading and for any advice you may have!"

Hey Sexxit! I'm hoping someone has had similar experiences in the past and can lend some helpful advice. I've tried to give as much background and context as I can, hence the wall-o-text, but skipping to the end bit is probably sufficient for most.

Wife (W26) and I (M26) have been together for about 10 years and married about 5 years. As a point of current comparison, I would say I am high libido and would love to have sex (PIV, mutual masturbation, whatever) every day or every other day at least. She is probably closer to average, maybe on the lower libido end, and says she'd be happy with once every week or two. Early on, as is typical of both early relationships and teens, we were quite sexually active; probably had sex on average once or twice a day for a year or so. We did it enough that she expressed the need to slow down a bit, if for nothing other than physical exhaustion. Now, we weren't having PIV five times a day or anything, but mutual masturbation and PIV usually would total twice or three times a day sometimes. So, I restrained myself a bit, and all was fine and we were at about three or four times a week.
Fast forward to college and living together, we would have sex (PIV or mutual masturbation) maybe two or three times per week if I recall correctly. This of course ebbed and flowed a bit, but that's about average I think. During that time, it got to the point that she actually felt I wasn't pursuing her enough or letting her know how I felt. Thus, I increased my external displays of affection and that seemed to help her feel more comfortable. I'd say, by the end of undergrad, we had sex maybe one or two times a week though. So, again, a drop, but still in at least a reasonable range.

Fast forward again to grad school and professional life, and the stress definitely impacted us a bit to have more ebb and flow (projects, reports, thousands of pages of reading, etc. and the associated stress/exhaustion will take time away from sexy times obviously). We're now in the once a week or two weeks range now. I would say I attempt to initiate, or at least tease her, a few times a day. I'm not necessarily trying to always get her to have sex, but it's probably leftover from needing to increase my external affections towards her in undergrad. And perhaps that is the major problem here.

She's now out of town for most of the week on internship and returns home during the weekend. The first couple weekends, we had sex again like at the end of high school. Over the weekend, we probably had sex three or four times total. It was great! And I honestly felt like she really wanted it. However, the rest of the time and for the past few years, the once a week or every other week has been the average frequency. I initiate, she usually says no, and I usually feel a bit let down (and show it I'm sure, even if I try not to) if I'm actually trying to get her to also have some fun. She then feels like she's (according to her after a large fight and then discussion regarding this) being pressured, ""broken,"" and potentially going to ruin the marriage because of not wanting sex as much. On the other hand, I often feel like she's not attracted to me (she says she still is very much and that is not the issue) or she's found someone else (highly doubtful and she says that's stupid of course).

So, at this point, I've agreed again to try to back off a bit (have done this before back in grad school, but I don't really think it changed anything) and try to not take it so bad when she doesn't reciprocate. On her end, she acknowledges that she's got something like a pressure block that, if she could stop worrying about it, would probably end up in wanting sex more, reciprocating, and initiating (I'd say I initiate 99% of the time). So, fellow Sexxit-ers, has anyone ever encountered a similar issue? IE: not typically ebb and flow, but what appears to be a longer-term block due to pressure and/or expectation anxiety? Any tips on how to work through it? We've discussed potentially going to a sex therapist, but want to try to work on it ourselves first. Honestly, communication really isn't much of an issue with us for almost anything, and we love each other very much, and the sex is great when we have it, but the frequency is just too low for my preferences.

TL;DR-Longterm relationship where wife apparently feels too much pressure to perform, which in turn continues to reduce sexual frequency and anxiety. I've tried taking steps back and generally trying to be as accommodating as possible in the past, but it never seems to help much. Any tips?

EDIT: Should also note no medications or med changes, use condoms (no other birth control), no children, no money issues to speak of, both active, healthy, and reasonably attractive. I've tried introducing toys, porn, etc., all of which she's very receptive, but the frequency and initiation just aren't there outside of that."
3orj0t,17,2015-10-14,[RANT] I'm starting to feel like the pervasive idea that there is some magical booming web development industry in Toronto is a fucking scam.,Fidele_Castronaut,torontoJobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/torontoJobs/comments/3orj0t/rant_im_starting_to_feel_like_the_pervasive_idea/,"I'm going to keep this as short as possible. I'm giving up. Straight up, no way about it. I've been unemployed since January of this year and I've had enough. I even went so far as to attending a Web Dev bootcamp with a 100% placement rate within two months, and I will officially hit the two month mark in two weeks time. Am I the best coder? Not by a long shot. Will I fuck up your project, or cause you more work than I'm worth? I would certainly like to think not. 

I can code. I know my way around JS, feel right at home with HTML/CSS, understand my way around Python (only made some crude reddit bots), have a firm understanding of Ruby (though I not much fond of it) and know a lot of important APIs well (think GMaps et al). I'm applying, I've been reached out to by recruiters - none of it seems to matter any. I have had two interviews in the past 4 months despite dozens and dozens of resumes. I am at a point where I've picked up a few freelance gigs which has helped me pay some bills, but now I'm broke and without any work. Again. For the millionth month in a row. I keep hearing about how booming the industry is, and quite frankly I have yet to see it. All my other fellow bootcamp grads have managed to land some sort of work, but I'm the one left off to the wayside. 

I know other programmers, and they have confirmed that I am a competent developer, and certainly competent enough that I should at least be able to land a internship or jr. dev role. I've done the networking thing by attending as many meetups as possible and ramping up my Linkedin; I keep active on twitter, and try to engage other devs. I am current with what's happening in the industry, and keep myself well versed. I am doing everything textbook, but I can't even get the fucking interviews. 

I'm done. I give up. This whole thing is a joke - it's as easy to get a job as a competent web dev in Toronto as it is getting a job as a  male waiter at Hooters.

Hey there people! Today I'm looking to do a role play set in the Fallout universe as I can't wait for Fallout 4 to come out. Anyway I want this to be a detailed, long term role play written in the third person. I like a lot of nsfw content but also care about a good story and character development. I prefer to role play on google docs and use a messenger to chat and set things up, messengers such as K Messenger, yahoo msger, skype and google chat/ docs. I have listed two characters that I've come up with below and explained them. I would prefer to play as the male ghoul Lee while I'm searching for someone to play as Scarlett. Have a read and if interested send me a message.

P.S other role plays I'm looking to do include A Jon Snow &amp; Melisandre rp (check post history for the prompt.) Also a Witcher RP.

&lt;-- History Archives Accessed --&gt; &lt;-- East Commonwealth Field Report New York City Recon Mission - 08/10/2256 --&gt; The city is a hopeless cause. What remains of the buildings there are are losing a fight against nature with mutated plants growing at an exponential rate and feral animals running wild in the streets.

We were able to gather some supplies and equipment from Vault 5 to the north of the city, but Vault 4, located under the ruins of Grand Central Station, is a bust. The door is sealed tight and I don't think they'll be opening it anytime soon.

While exiting the city we encountered a party of well-armed soldiers claiming to be scouting for supplies from a settlement in the Pittsburgh area. They were accompanied by several ragged looking survivors who seemed to be in some distress.

Due to their heavily armaments and well-trained appearance we disengaged and will be returning to Great Lanta shortly.

Overseer Notes - Father Armstrong, Carter Amendment - 03/23/2161-01 Damn fool child has really gone too far this time. Young Emily Harris was down in MedBay this morning for her annual medical and reported being molested sexually by the girl. At this rate we won't have anyone willing to visit the doctor once old Peabody dies.

I told her father the girl needed to be married off by now, it's not natural for her to be unwed at her age and it only serves to encourage sin. Best course is to get rid of her ASAP, so young Peggy Carter can take her place and one day be Chief Medical Officer instead.

I'm sending Scarlett out into the city to find some fresh medical supplies, Lord knows we need them. If by some miracle she does manage to survive some good may yet come of this whole mess.

Thursday, 26th March, 2161 AD - 84 AGW

Blinking her eyes as she lifted her hand to cover them Scarlett stepped up the staircase into the largest room she'd ever seen. Across the hall the sun glared mightily thought the large windows as she peered around at the unfamiliar surroundings. Everywhere she looked there seemed to be rubble, but she was undeterred, this was the first time in generations anyone had left the Vault, and she felt honoured to have been chosen.

Slowly she began to make her way over to the window, climbing up the pile of rubble before looking out over the city. To anyone else the overgrown vista may have been depressing, but to Scarlett it was a new horizon filled with possibilities. As she looked out over the crumbling buildings only one thought passed through her mind.

'I wonder if there's anyone out there, and I wonder if they wanna get laid...'

---------------------------------------------------

Charlie 'Lee' Stuart originates from southern Texas, following his mother's untimely death in 2071 Lee spent his teenage years living on a cattle ranch in America with his biological father. Culture formed his opinions and skill set towards hunting and a dislike for 'city slicking' tourists as his hick father would spatter.

Then in 2077 during the Great War, the bombs fell decimating the globe.

Somehow Lee survived the radiation through a long and painful period of necrosis and mutation, transforming him into what the 'smoothskins' called a freak, a zombie, a ghoul.

Over the next two centuries Lee would remember less and less about his pre-war youth.

Appearance/Personality Lee is a very reclusive and shrouded character. He will dress in a way that covers his identity from hostile smoothskins. Lee wears a duster and boots with a stormchaser hat, neck scarf goggles which cover his face entirely. His voice is very gravely and raspy from long term vocal chord damage, this is somewhat muffled by his scarf but those who know the sound of a ghoul are likely to notice so he tends to stick to gestures with new or unfamiliar people. Lee tends rarely leaves his dwelling without his rifle slung on his back.

Weapon of Choice - Scoped and Modified .308 Hunting Rifle Originally one of his father's rifles, Lee has managed to maintain the firearm over 200 years through constant changes and upgrades. Currently equipped with a 3.5x scope and extended 10 shot clip this bolt action rifle has been Lee's main source of survival and income.

(Lee also carries an old military combat knife)

Dwelling Lee lives in a hand built shack in the remote wasteland, built on a good vantage point for hunting and defence reasons.

Inside is one open space with a camp bed, desk and a piles upon piles of books in a somewhat organized mess.

SPECIAL: Strength: 3 - Doughy Baby Do ghouls even lift? Lee's deteriorated body will struggle to overpower tough obstacles.

Perception: 8 - Monocled Falcon Don't let the cloudy orbs for eyes confuse you, Lee is extremely alert.

Endurance: 7 - Tough as Nails Compared to a smoothskin Lee can take one heck of a beating by the elements

Charisma: 2 - Old Hermit Nods and grunts are his social forte

Intelligence: 6 - Gifted Above average intelligence, mainly through reading and self taught skills

Agility: 5 - Under Control Nothing noteworthy about his swiftness, the fact he can run away from smoothskins is a feat in itself.

Luck: 5 - Coin Flip Unless through a perk or a level of skill dictates otherwise Lee has a pretty 50/50 chance in most situations.

PERKS/TRAITS:

Comprehension (One additional skill point gained for every book read) Lee spends a lot of time reading the piles and piles of scavenged literature in his den.

Hunter (75% Critical Damage Boost against Animals) Lee is very skilled at hunting game for both consumption and trade.

Scrounger (Increased change to find ammunition) While he's an above average scavenger Lee seems to have this uncanny knack of finding ammo even when he doesn't need or even want it.

Radiation Immune (Racial Trait) Lee isn't only immune to radiation but seems to acquire healing properties from being near high radiation or drinking irradiated water.

Sharpshooter (+2 Perception during range finding) &amp; Trigger Discipline (20% accuracy, 20% reduced fire rate) Lee lays in wait, biding his time with a patience only a ghoul's lifespan can muster. Lee isn't quick to shoot but when he does it usually counts.

Outdoorsman (Increased chance of special encounters, reduced chance of bad encounters) Over the past two centuries Lee has adopted a good eye for trouble, avoiding it well while out in the wastelands.

3oswie,3,2015-10-14,26M4F Need to cum? Join the club; several prompts!,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3oswie/26m4f_need_to_cum_join_the_club_several_prompts/,"I've been playing host to friends and family the past week or two, and as such, my sex life has been put completely on hold. With no privacy and no space, I've got a lot of pent-up sexual energy, which I'm looking to release tonight with the naughty women of DPP. ;)

I'm around all night and looking to get as filthy as possible. I've got several prompts below, but I'm also open to working a completely-different scene out as long as it stays away from my dislikes. When you respond, send me your likes/dislikes, too; I'm a giver, and it REALLY gets me off to know you're enjoying yourself as we do this.

Some prompts/ideas below:

1) It's your standard party scene. You pick the venue (night club, pool party, strip club, etc.), but regardless of the location, it's hopping, with booze flowing and scantily-clad women (and maybe men, too) running around looking absolutely perfect. Whether you're a partygoer, a bartender, a stripper/hooker, or any other role you can imagine, you're out tonight for one reason: To get fucked hard.

2) You're an intern at the office I work in. We don't deal with each other much, other than idle chit-chat. However, in my side job editing video for some shady clients, I notice a familiar face working a stripper pole and giving lap dances. It's you, and I wait until we're alone in the office to confront you with the evidence.

3) I've married an older woman and have entered into an open relationship. My new wife has a daughter younger than me, and you're her best friend. We've been thinking of you as a bad influence, but lately, my eyes have been more drawn to a body that's absolutely built for sex. You and my step-daughter come home late one night, and my wife isn't around.

4) I'm at the gym and can't concentrate. Every time I go, you're there, strutting your stuff in an ill-fitting sports bra and short shorts that barely constrain your juicy ass. You turn heads and you know it, and one day I work up the courage to introduce myself.

5) I've just moved into the neighborhood as a single guy, and my new place is right next door or across the street from you. This opens up a myriad of possibilities; maybe you're a college girl, a similarly-aged younger professional, or even a MILF, but either way, you eye the new single guy in the neighborhood and are curious.

6) Anything else you can think of that doesn't fit my dislikes!

My kinks: Big breasts/titfucking, bimbos/bimbofication, dirty talk (the raunchier the better), oral sex (giving and receiving), group sex, multiple orgasms/cumplay, bad girls (partying/drinking/smoking all encouraged).

My no-go's: Animals, bathroom stuff, blood/gore, heavy BDSM, incest, noncon.

Hope to hear from you!"

I've been depressed since I was 15 and it's always been the same. It messed with my head until I no longer felt excitement or enjoyment.  I was ""fine"" even if I felt numb, tried killing myself just to see if I'd go with it or back out. The games I loved were suddenly repetitive and time-wasting, going out with friends was tiring and sleeping was my only comfort. It was so easy to hide from the sun and new beginnings under my comforter.

Then I moved to a little foreign town for a year of college and I have to be honest: I've never met people who are actively willing to help me get through what I've been going through for such a long time until now and I'm so, so grateful.

I'm trying to climb out of the downward spiral I've found myself in again, and this time, I..  feel positive about it. I actually have some things to look forward to: an internship in Valencia, opening up my own art exhibit; and even little things like sketching and watching ballet and Friday picnics with my boyfriend- oh, have I mentioned how great my boyfriend is? He's always so loving and supportive when I break down. I told him my idea about an art exhibit yesterday and when he came home from work today, he got me canvases. He got me scented candles too just because he knows I'm a sucker for those. He's been with me through days I feel like dancing on top of trash cans to days I feel like jumping in front of moving trains. He's helped me look at things in a different way, and for that, he will always have a special place in my heart. (Mark, I love you and I can't wait to spend my future with you.)

Tomorrow, I'm finally seeing a therapist for the first time. I was shaking under the rain when I called their number to make an appointment - when I realised that I've had enough of this and I don't deserve to feel this terrible for no reason. 

I told them ""I'm ready for help"". I think I am this time. 

(I just wanted this off my chest (HEHE). Now I gotta cuddle this sexy, nice-smelling blond boy sleeping next to me)"
3ot4aw,7,2015-10-14,Introduction story plus advice needed (Kind of a rant too),[deleted],BPDlovedones,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/3ot4aw/introduction_story_plus_advice_needed_kind_of_a/,"This post is about me and my uBPD gf of 1,5 years. This post is mostly to get things off my chest, excuse my English because it isn't my native tongue. This could be a wall of text, I apologize in advance.

Last year I was doing a study abroad in an Asian country (European myself), and that is where I met my current gf. We met in class and I was taken aback by her beauty, wit and fierceness.

I asked her out and pretty soon we started dating. In the beginning it was like heaven on earth, she would come to visit me nearly everyday and it was great. We laughed and talked, sex life was great and she was understanding of my habits at the time (smoking, clubbing and stuff like that)

She didn't show any of her bpd traits at all, in hindsight I know she is capable of doing this with 'strangers'. Embarrassment is one of her greatest fears so around new people she can control herself very well.

After around 3/4 months it was time for me to head back to my own country, and that is where I really fell in love. She was crying and pleading for me not to go, I had never experienced emotions this strong before, and it really touched my heart.

Her parents own several companies so in the end we agreed to go LDR and I would come back to do my internship. This is where the fun really started. Even though we were a few 1000's miles apart, she became very controlling and needy. Chat 24/7 and Skype everyday, plus would get extremely upset and agitated over very small things. 

She would ignore me for days on end after I ""made her angry"" and I think she must have broken up with me at least 5 times. Foolish me thought it was the strain of the LDR that caused the change in behavior.

When I finally came back things were never like they were before, she rented a small condo for me and for some reason took kind of ownership over it. I found out she is actually extremely obsessed with cleanliness and neatness, I'm not sure of this is also BPD behavior of some kind of compulsive disorder..

She would be so manipulative, demanding and controlling. Every time her mood switched it was my fault, if I didn't text her non stop she would be upset. She told me that she thought hanging out with friends should be around once per 2 weeks.

Anyway you guys probably get the picture, all hell broke loose. My problem is now that I've taken a job at her parents company, and signed a year lease for a condo in this foreign country. What I thought was a dream come true is turning out to be a nightmare.

I want to end it but I'm very dependent on her family at the moment. If I break up and lose the job I will be stuck here alone with bills piling up but no income.

I'm sorry for the rant and incoherent story, I'm needed to get this off my chest and hopefully some of you have advice or can relate."
3otd52,9,2015-10-15,MUST VENT,UnluckyLucas,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3otd52/must_vent/,"*Arrggghhhh*

1. Nmom stole my antidepressants. The first thing I did was snitch on her when she made it evident she took them in order to coerce me into doing something menial or redundant. Edad tried to talk to her but gave up after a hot minute of her justifying denying a suicidal person their medication. Then I got my little and big sisters after her, and she tried to play innocent and say that I lost my own drugs. Biggest sister knows Nmom has stolen *and destroyed* my medication before so she took none of that flak. Unfortunately, middle sister took Nmom's side and agreed I should be subservient to be allowed my own prescription. Things got better when I found them and stole them back. Police said this was something domestic that should be settled in-house.

2. I'm getting uber close to finishing my second book. (More or less, it needs a healthy shot of editing.) I'm nearing up on, between books 1 and 2, nearly 2,000 pages of content. So, Nmom decided it was time she submitted my book to a contest to get herself published. However, being  stickler for grammar, decided to edit my work. I took the liberty beforehand of just putting *the raunchiest, filthiest smut* within the story, and changing random lines to make no sense. She got mad at me for writing smut, and I just smiled and said, ""Yup, this is like half the story. Lot's of gangbangs, you know?"" She got creeped out and wanted to cuss me out for writing adult material (""You're not old enough to be writing or reading this stuff!"") ^^I'm ^^twenty-six. Now she is no longer interested in plagiarizing it... yet.

3. This fat psycho started talking down to me because I didn't make all A's in all of my classes. I did make A's in all of the classes she said I would struggle in, saying I would never do well without her help (that she never gives.) She started Facebooking family members to let them know I'm not doing as well as her academically (My senior and almost-graduate level courses are supposed to be as simple as her sophomore courses.) Of course she left out that I've dragged my GPA up substantially, and am THIS close to an internship. Cue a few calls from family telling me to listen to my mother because she knows better. And her calling my professors to bother them about it. One of my professors talked to me tonight about her violation of a privacy clause between professors and students, and that jail time *is an option for her.*

4. I told that deranged maniac, ""I'm more than a quarter-century old. I can sleep in as late as I want when I have night classes."" Cue her trashing some things and getting confrontational about me 'letting' messes be made. She's since been following me around and telling me to clean up my messes. ""It's your clothes and dishes, so you should clean it up!"" she tells me. I then put on [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDdR4c9vcEw&amp;index=17&amp;list=PLoq58GDeKElcdxUImxXYKqG91vdxzwrBH) as loud as I could and knocked a handful of things over in her room. ""It's your stuff, so it's your mess."" Cue her justifying her behavior and how I just don't understand - she even said I was the same as 'every other man'. :/

EDIT

* Why is this crazy person following me and screaming at me to do the dishes while interrupting me to say ""Excusez-moi, I was talking!"" *when no one is talking*?! I'm already doing the dishes, I wish she would calm her fat head and actually let me do it. "

I checked in with Rob about the group project. I'm the leader of the group now. It's nothing important, but it feels good I guess. I found an email from career services and I spent over an hour this morning going over my resume and application. It's just an internship, but it's a start. I hope I get a call.

I even did my laundry, went to the grocery store, got a haircut. All those things I tend to put off for weeks and just lay around. I got up and did them.

I got my homework done just in time for classes. Aced the quiz, and I gradually understood everything and drove home.

I'm not moving on. I still miss you. I'm still going to hurt tonight and into tomorrow morning. And I'll still blame myself. But some days, maybe I can do both.

    Tank Commander, Jr Grade, REGAL-F.
    First Woman’s Tankery Division
    Dated: August 16th, 1952.
    Subject: Mission at Stalingrad Ruins.
    Report Begins:
This was always the hardest part, sadly. The actual *writing* of the report. Though her 18th birthday had come and gone, celebrated in the cold dimness of the Siberian Winter with her girls in their revamped Jagdpanther 38(t), she still felt like a frightened child, perpetually on the cusp of disappointing her parents. 

But her parents were dead. That was something she had in common with most of the girls of the Woman’s 1st. Being younger than 25, and being an orphan. She was now 18, a fact that made her a little proud. She had never expected to make it this far, with the Liberty Army marching well into Poland, and with Forward Manufactorums stretching all the way into New Europe itself. 

New Europe.

When she had been a child, her Father, the Colonel had called this the USSR. Soviet Russia. A cold, barren, inhospitable place, that the Third Reich would crush beneath the cold Iron of the Panzerkorps. The world would be unified under Swastika and Fuhrer, and that would be the end of it.  A perfect world for all Aryan and Loyal bloodlines. A perfect place for his Daughter to grow up. Such a future was now known to be impossible.

On December 7th, 1941, America invaded the Island Nation of Japan. With most of the Navy preparing for a sneak attack of the territory of Hawaii, there was nothing to stop the Airborne Infantry and the Shockmarines from taking the nation in less than 48 hours. What happened next shocked the world, and deeply influenced the Third Reich.

The USA was dissolved. Instead, they rechristened their nation The Liberty Empire.

And they killed every single citizen of Japan. Man, woman, and child. None were spared.

    On Friday, August 1st, 1952, the crew of Jagdpanther 38(t)
    “Porcelain Cannon” discovered that the Liberty Army 
    is constructing a Manufactorum on the ruins of Stalingrad.

Stalingrad, where the German Army and USSR had *both* been sneak-attacked by the Liberty Army. 3 *million* fatalities. The single most violent military engagement in human history. The turning point of the war. See, from the point the Liberty Empire was born, they were a loose cannon. The invasion and subsequent eradication of the Japanese people. Invading and “colonizing” the British Isles as *New Jamestown*. The Tesla Bomb on Normandy Beach.

The War, which had looked to be a drawn out, ugly engagement suddenly looked to be over much, *much* faster.

Those with military service were drafted on all sides, in order to hold back the Red, White, and Blue storm. Her Father was killed in Paris. Her mother, about 45 miles away from the German Border. She was enlisted in the Hitler Youth Girls Tank Division, and was teamed up with another orphan girl. Together, they got to work learning the intricacies of tank operations.

    At 0345 Local Time, Driver Anneliese Straub spotted a pair 
    of Liberty Type-3 Hovertanks, patrolling the outer reaches 
    of the ruined city. 
    Inside, lights were shining on a spire being constructed. I 
    gave the order for a scouting team to disembark the tank and 
    scout on foot.

Anneliese Straub was her best friend. Her rock, and constant companion. A girl from a nearby village, they had been assigned to the same tank when they were enlisted in the HYGTD. Whereas Alice was quiet, shy, and thoughtful, Annaliese was loud. A fiery girl who had found the dyes and supplies necessary to turn her blonde hair blue, she didn’t abide pointless rules or regulations. She had even shouted the Kommandant into letting her keep the blue hair. 

Annaliese was a sight to behold.

So, when the morning of June 6th, 1944 came, and the Third Reich was invaded in force, she was surprised to find Annaliese crying in her bed. The tanks were mobilizing, even though the two-girl-per-tank rule did not really properly crew any tank. It struck Alice at once. The reason for her tears.

She was lamenting their deaths.

*No.* Not like this. Not here. Those were the thoughts pounding Alice’s head as she dragged Annaliese into the driver’s seat of their Hetzer. Alice even had to *start* the tank for her. The roar of the engine snapped Annaliese back to reality, at least enough to drive. Alice still remembered the shake in her voice as Annaliese asked, “Where are we going?”

For the first time, Alice’s voice was the rock. Alice was, for the first time in her life, the *Commander.*

Her response had been simple.

“East.”

    The Construction of a Manufactorum, of course, 
    is contrary to our wants.
    I felt it was worth the risk of sending scouts, 
    but with such danger I opted to send my 
    smallest, fastest girls.

Elena and Nika were the pair of girls that Alice and Annaliese had found in Poland. Their tank had not been a welcome sight there, yet when Alice and Annaliese parked in a bush to scout for fuel and supplies, these two girls approached the tank. Climbed on it. Were looking for a way in.  When the two girls returned to the tank, they were surprised to find a party waiting for them. 

Vodka. Bread. And the tale of a Blitzkrieg that Alice and Annaliese were all too familiar with. 

Burning homes. SS shooting parents in the streets. Snipers preventing any escape. So, the girls had hidden. Now the town was abandoned, the girls the last citizens of a town that had stood for years.

Casualties of the Third Reich. Casualties of the military that Alice and Annaliese were fleeing. Casualties of a war that *nobody* would win. That nobody could *possibly* win.

At least, not alone.

    Gunner Catherine took use of the stolen Rail Rifle 
    to keep track of the scouts as they infiltrated the city. 
    Not wanting to risk being caught, 
    we opted for Radio Silence. 
    I do not regret this decision. 

The girls were valuable additions to the crew, and Alice was glad she had offered them a spot. Annaliese worried about the girls harboring hatred for the German people, and feared that Annaliese and Alice may fall asleep one night, never to wake up again. If it hadn’t been for Stalingrad, Annaliese may have never slept again. 

Stalingrad changed a lot of things, for a lot of people. It made the threat of the Liberty Army more palpable, and showed *just* how outmatched the USSR and the Germans were. If the Liberty Army could mobilize forces of *that* strength, *that* quickly, the world was already theirs.

But it would not be that way. No, Europe would not go quietly into death.

REGAL-F. The Unified **R**ussian **E**nglish **G**erman **L**and-**F**orces. Teams of soldiers, months ago enemies, now brothers in a desperate war against those who would take the world for their own. In the North, New Berlin was founded as a military installation under REGAL-F.  No more Third Reich. No more Wehrmacht. And no more men in the Panzerkorps. Not enough. So, women were to be Tankers. 

Their records spoke for themselves, especially the crew of Jagdpanther 38(t) “Porcelain Cannon”. Alice, who was known as “Heltzer”, had abandoned her surname, and taken charge in a way that nobody expected. She led her team with efficiency, but also resounded kindness in a way that often got her criticized. She was awarded, merited, and given free reign of her tank. 

She had tested the limits of that on her second operation out, when she came back with a *5th* member of her tank crew. Another girl, but this one in an olive-drab jumpsuit, with the *Red, White, and Blue* of the Liberty Army. 

An *enemy.*

Catherine Forte, Daughter of Rear General Adrian Forte. REGAL-F command saw her as a hostage. Alice cleared the air on that *quite* quick.  Well, Annaliese cleared the air. Nobody shouts quite like that girl. When the dust settled, REGAL-F had a new gunner in the Woman’s Tankery Division.  

    3 hours of preliminary scouting shows that Manufactorum
    Construction nears completion. 
    Recommend Full Force Strike, ASAP.
    -Alice Heltzer, Jr Commander.

-----

It wasn’t exactly a long walk from my office to the office of Commissar Natalia. Still, instead of having one of the spunky, underage trainees that we used as interns deliver this message, I usually opted to do it myself. If I wrote it, I delivered it. Firstly, because I felt it was important to show Natalia that she made the right decision, letting me keep my tank and hand-pick my crew. Secondly, my reports usually contained sensitive information. I didn’t trust any of the teenage girls running around the Office of the Commanders to keep a secret about my *haircare*, let alone classified military information.

Imagine my surprise when I looked up and someone was waiting for me. Catherine Forte was standing at what I can only assume she considered *attention*, her shoulders slouched and her jumpsuit far too loose. Still, she looked happy. 

Or, at least, content. 

“Commander.” She said, approaching me, her blonde hair getting whipped around by the snow, “May I have a word?”  

I had practiced my nod for many weeks, in the private mirror of my quarters. Curt, Polite, and Inviting. It didn’t offend, but was a rapid non-verbal solution to the problem of interpersonal discussion. Catherine took it well.

“W-well,” she started, and I realized whatever she had to say was going to be *long*, so I silently directed her into the private meeting room of the Commander’s Offices. She seemed grateful for the relief from the freezing winds, and offered me a weak smile before beginning again.

“Commander Heltzer, I don’t know if I am going to be a good fit for your tank crew. I have seen the way that most people view me around base. They *loathe* me. They think I am going to call my Father, and wipe this base off the face of the Earth. That couldn’t be farther from the truth, though. I hate my Father. I hate the whole of the ‘Liberty Army.’ We are tyrants and murderers, and if it weren’t for the Tesla Vault, we wouldn’t be doing anywhere near this well in the war.”

She was shaking, whether from rage or the lingering chill, I could not tell.

“I want to fight. I want to win. I want to be with you, who found me, and be with the girls, who I already care deeply for.  I know I haven’t been around long, but can’t I stay?”

Her question caught me off guard. Leave? Sure, she had only been here, like, a month… but there was no question of losing my gunner. 

“You’re staying.” I said, watching her carefully. 5’7. Thin. Pale, like most of us. Blonde hair, down to her shoulder. Red cheeks, frozen from the Siberian winds. Her frame, tucked  away under a loose jacket, was thin, a slight bust, but cute in a tomboyish way. I nodded again, slower, and more deliberately. “Yes. I’ll tell the Commissar, or worse, I’ll have *Annaliese* reinform her. If we can have her recover her hearing after the shouting bit that Annaliese, I am sure she’ll come and confirm it herself.”

With that, I laugh. A more loving, more gentle laugh than I had laughed in a while.

“I have to go turn in my report. I’ll meet you in our bunkhouse, okay? It has been too long since I hung out with the girls.”

-----

Turning in my report was an adventure all its own. A discussion about tactical implications of a fully functioning Manufactorum. 25 minutes of yelling about sending scouts behind enemy lines. More yelling, and a discussion about the nearly impossible record her tank had, and she was done. Dismissed out into the cold winds, with a nearly impossible task.

Bonding with the girls.

Honestly, it was easier to be a Commander, than a friend. Her parents hadn’t raised her to be *friendly*. They had raised her to win. To survive. To lead with honor and distinction, and to be willing to sacrifice anything for those ends. 

These girls weren’t sacrifices. 

Annaliese, with her bright blue hair, and her tendency to yell loudly when people got in her Commander’s way. She was the tallest member of the squad, at 5’10, and also the bustiest. Her jumpsuit was so tight that they didn’t *need* to measure *that* aspect of her. It was there, for all to see. How could Alice order Annaliese into the jaws of death? 

Or Elena, tanned and beautiful, with shiny brown hair and golden eyes? She was always so bubbly and excited just to be in the tank. She was the furthest thing from a warrior she had, but as a Communications Officer, she was top-notch. Concise and kind, she had a knack for getting people to see things in the way that we needed them seen. She was irreplaceable.

Nika would be sorely missed. Her dirty skin and red hair was a welcome sight in the tank, her speed at loading the main gun was impressive, even by Alice’s standards. Sure, she swore frequently, but that was more due to a love of excitement and action than any sort of genuine rage. She was the penultimate tomboy, often confused *for* a boy. She didn’t mind the confusion, though. She took it and ran with it. After all, she was *almost* as much a lesbian as Alice herself.

Maybe that is what made all of it so hard. Annaliese, Elena, Nika, and Catherine were all wonderful, beautiful girls in their own right, but war was no time for dating. War was a time of blood and violence, of long nights and cold tanks, of hopes broken and dreams dashed. Nobody was looking to start a relationship with the Jr. Commander of the most decorated REGAL-F tank in the war. 

So, sighing heavily sighing, I opened the door to the “Porcelain Cannon” bunkhouse. Our home. On the far end, away from the main barracks, stood my private quarters.

That is not where I would be staying tonight.

“Hello girls. I am home.”

-----  

And now, a bit of explanation!

About a week ago, I was walking back from Walmart (which stands an abrasive 2.5 miles away from my apartment,) when my iPhone decided to repeat the English dub of Katyusha. As a big fan of the [Russian Version featured in Girls und Panzer]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx03zTvL4K0), having the song stuck on repeat was no bad thing. 
Three days later, I got to work. What originally started as a Russian Revolution prompt turned into a full blown Alt History story, featuring girls, tanks, and myself as a self-inserted character, as I do with *every prompt I write*. But, more importantly, the girls evolved. Ideas of stories between them, as the girls grow together, danced through my head. These stories were not meant for me to create. They were meant for us to forge together, in the fires of war and passion. 

So, where do you go from here? Well, you can choose to be a girl. Any girl. A new girl. Whatever. I may actually sit back and *write* this, into something more than a DPP prompt. If I do, I may want to use any characters we come up with. So, you know, effort. I don’t expect anyone to spend 4 days crafting this thing, like I did. I don’t expect anything, really.

I love girls. I love tanks. I am *Panzer_Girl*, for goodness sakes. I just wanted to share my loves with you, my loving DPP family.

3oue96,15,2015-10-15,Hard Case Newbie at Uni? How to Make Approach Anxiety Disappear (what worked for me),spin1t,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/3oue96/hard_case_newbie_at_uni_how_to_make_approach/,"So you can't approach a girl? It's pretty intimidating approaching a girl out of nowhere right?. It's fucking hard! Especially seeing all these ridiculous approaches from the RSD and Simple Pickup guys in their YouTube videos, like that's **so** ridiculously hard. ""Solutions"" to the problem like GET INTO GOD MODE! or GET INTO STATE! sound even fucking harder. If I can't approach how am I going to dance uninhibited like a money or start doing push ups on the street?

So how do you approach if its sooooo hard? Easy. 
Make it even HARDER **NOT** to approach. 

------------

**Rules**

When you see a girl you find attractive you have 2 options:

**1. Approach her and say ""Hi""**

(Or hit on her, depending on the level you're at or whatever sticking point you need to work on)

**2. Stare at her for 10 MINUTES** 

Not her leg or her purse, HER FACE. No breaking eye contact for 10 straight minutes, or until you start talking to her. Set a timer on your phone and start staring FOR 10 MINUTES.. No looking at your phone, no looking anywhere else, no breaking eye contact. STARE AT HER. 

------------

I call it:  **""OFPF:Out of The Frying Pan and Into the Fire Method""**, basically you're making it sooooo awkward not to approach the most natural thing is to approach. Weaponize your laziness! 

What I noticed is that almost all of the time you're going to approach within the first 2 minutes, if not DEFINITELY at the 5 minute mark when people surrounding you start noticing and think you're weird as shit. If you somehow make it to the 7 minute mark, its gone so ridiculously far, and you're high tension anxiety has been strung out so far, that you normally get tired of it and just approach out of exhaustion. It's really interesting how it works. If you ever get to 10 minutes, which I have a few times, you'll be pretty annoyed and frustrated at the whole thing and promptly approach the next beautiful girl you see just to avoid the fucking pain of staring at something for 10 straight minutes. (10 minutes is a really long time). 

Many of the guys who don't approach, past me included, avoided it because it was **so hard**  to do and sitting listening to your ipod or just keeping your head down was **so much easier** . By switching the difficulty of choices up you'll see a switch in your actions as well. 

This game works great if you're at University or game there because you can play it in classrooms, student organizations, bus stops, the dining hall, the gym or even walking to class. It also works great at places like the mall, bus stops, coffee shops or even parties and less crowded clubs. 

It doesn't work that well on regular street game or packed clubs and bars because with walking and moving girls will just leave your view, so there is a definitely a limitation. If you're outside, please don't follow her for 10 minutes if she's walking somewhere, that's really creepy. I guess you can possibly do it at a club or bar by following her enough to talk to her but I've never really done it. 

---------------------

A little background on myself, I'm brown, idk thought it was worth mentioning haha. I made this game for myself before I found about ""The Game"" or /r/seddit or anything online and it worked amazing for me at University, currently still a student, by getting me to talk to and meet new girls. Two years ago I broke up with my LTR, after the usual depression/alcoholic period, there was a crackdown on the college party scene and my usual easy hooks up were gone. To get laid, I adapted and started meeting random girls in class and around campus using this method. Since then, the party scene has picked up and since July, over the summer and the 2 months of the semester, I've been busy with my internships, school and family issues and thus all my lays have come from parties at my house (I live in a frat house), social circle and most of all tinder (I have pretty good pictures). While having girls come to me like this is convenient, its a major crutch that I don't think I'll have after college.  

I plan on putting this method back into practice to get myself to start actively approaching once again, but this time keeping track of all attempts, successes and failures in field reports (Which I'll publish here after the first lay). I'd love to take this challenge on with anyone else in seddit who wants to go at it for some friendly competition. Heck who am I kidding, I'd love to have someone else do it with so I can wipe the floor with them lol. 

Hope this post helps someone, the method really helped me. As I said, I'm doing it again starting today so let me know (PM or comment) if you're going try to do it yourself so we can link up. "
3oungw,7,2015-10-15,I (21M) feel like I don't know how to progress with life,silhouettess,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3oungw/i_21m_feel_like_i_dont_know_how_to_progress_with/,"I've always worked hard with my studies and graduated with a reputable degree from a renowned university. Yet for a whole year after graduating I've failed to find a job and don't know how to progress.




Every time I even think about having to fill an application form, write a cover letter or even just search for a job I am literally overwhelmed by this feeling of anxiety and dread. As a result I've only managed to make less than 10 real applications in over a year (and I only managed to do most of these barely on the deadlines which obviously didn't strengthen my chances) and done very small part-time jobs. I have always had suicidal thoughts (mainly from being raised by a narcissistic parent) since my teen years and this anxiety just makes the thoughts worse. I know with certainty I would never commit suicide because there are people in my life I would never choose to do that to (no matter how depressed I became), but it's more like a comforting thought. I have never feared the idea of death and it feels like it would be so peaceful to just not exist or have to worry.




In the first few months I solely blamed this on laziness as I enjoyed being able to finally take a breath after graduating (I still do partially put this down to laziness), but I slowly realized that this overwhelming negative feeling didn't feel natural. I have no problem with willpower in other areas and physically I am fine too - I eat extremely healthily, I exercise regularly and still go out to see friends frequently. I even know I would have no problem in the work environment since I've worked before on internships and liked it. It is literally just the applying stage that I am frozen on. It's not like I have no ambition or plans for the future either, I just can't seem to bridge my present and future due to not being able to take the most important first step. 




I know my problem seems pathetic. Relatives and friends have pressured me (with good intentions and rightly so), I've watched motivational videos, I briefly tried meditation (not sure I did properly though), I tried sticking to a routine, I've downloaded a bunch of procrastination apps and nothing removes the anxiety the moment I try to search for a job. I think about all the people who have far worse problems than me, but that just makes me further stressed and it's quite a vicious cycle. I go to sleep most nights feeling ridiculously frustrated with myself. 




I know my anxiety is caused by several factors, some of which include: I feel I have to apply for a good job because of the expectations of everybody around me, that if I just got some random job I would gradually become less close with my high-flyer friends (not because they would look down on me, but I think it's naive to assume a huge income disparity wouldn't affect friendships) and what I really want is just some office stress-free job.
   



I believe people should take charge of their own lives and so this has just constantly made me disappointed in myself. I just need an outside perspective on this. Comments, criticisms, advice, help etc.. How do I overcome this overwhelming anxiety? I don't have anybody to talk to about these things and it already feels good just to have it written out at least. Sorry this became a really long post. 




tl;dr: Can't get myself to search for jobs because of extreme dread and anxiety, don't know how to overcome it. What's wrong with me?"

Someone I went to school with also works in middle school and recently called it language arts tutoring... that is what it FEELS like to me, too. My general education kids are working on figurative language, vocabulary, writing narratives, reading comprehension, prefixes, suffixes....it all feels like these are taught in their main core classes, but maybe the kids are behind. But I'm clueless. I didn't study prefixes in grad school or how to write narratives- how can I be expected to help the kids with these skills?! I am so so so so overwhelmed -- not only with the therapy part of this job, but with all the paperwork associated with it. Professional Development goals, staff meetings, SPGOs, progress reports, lessons, IEPs and revisions, goals, referrals.... I just don't know if I'm cut out to work in a school district... especially in a middle school :(  I worked in a preschool for my internship, and it's so different. 

It's my second month working in the school and I am barely holding it together. An SLP in the district told me this week that after 25 years of working, she is still overwhelmed and taking work home. How can this be?! I don't want to be overwhelmed, stressed, taking work home when I should be spending time with my family, for my entire career!

I guess I wanted to come on here and get some advice... maybe someone else is feeling like I am. There are so many responsibilities of the SLP in schools and everything I read says *I* am the ""expert"" who is ""highly trained"" -- I sure don't feel that way with this caseload. 

I also have nonverbal students with autism, needing their AAC devices programmed, an MD class with higher functioning autism mostly needing social skills, and LLD class whose spelling needs a lot of work, but is that my job, too? 

I love working with the kids. Don't know what the heck I'm doing for ""therapy"" at this level, but my heart is in it for the kids. I want to stick it out this year then maybe look for jobs with the younger kids, but I don't know how I'm going to do this middle school job for nine more months.

Sincerely,

We're currently printing with ABS plastic. We're trying to print a 10"" x 10"" x 1/4"" tall building façade for a client. Our problem is that the print keeps peeling up in the corners.

[Here an image showing the problem.](http://imgur.com/3todiBA) In this photo, we put masking tape on the print table and then put glue on top of the masking tape, but we normally just put glue on the table (as the instructions say). As you can see, the part is still sticking to the masking tape, but the tape is peeling off of the print table.

Once the part peels up that much, we have to abort the print or else the print head ends up hitting the part and the print gets ruined.

Does anyone have any recommendations?"

I just received an offer for a technology consulting internship with a Big Four firm, and I am in the process of deciding what city would be the best for my personality. As an internship, I could easily move to a different city for full-time if I don't like it, and I will be traveling ~80% anyway for my consulting work, but I still want to come home to a city that I love. 


My top factors:

* Very big city with skyscrapers/skyline
* Fits ambitious ENTJ personality, or has large NT presence
* Has large technology presence. Not sure right now if I want to stay tech consulting or go into tech industry (Google, Amazon, FB)
* Provides the most opportunities for me to learn, grow, and succeed


My top cities right now:

1) **New York City**

* the cost of living is very high but I feel like it might be worth it for the opportunities there, the connections I could make, and the overall prestige of working in NYC


2) **Chicago**

* a slightly smaller, less expensive version of NYC--not sure if its as ENTJ suited though 


3) **Seattle**

* Very tech-based, fits my love for coffee/learning, and filled with INTJs, but wouldn't give me the prestige and personal satisfaction in knowing I'm in the *best* and biggest city

3ow35q,22,2015-10-15,Cerner Yearly Reviews Explained,hellgiver,cerner,https://www.reddit.com/r/cerner/comments/3ow35q/cerner_yearly_reviews_explained/,"After a few requests I figure it's best to fully explain how Cerner's review process works and my tips on how to use the system to your advantage.

&amp;nbsp;

**Why me?**

I worked at Cerner for almost 5 years.  I don't want to give away my name in case I upset someone because I left on very good terms and really do love the people I worked with.  Some people hate the company after working for it, I do not.  Also, a lot of the friends I made talked with me about their careers because sharing information is your greatest weapon.  Also, bear in mind discussing your salary is strictly forbidden by Cerner HR (**which is illegal**, but whatever), but by law you can do it and any action taken against you for it is ground for a wrongful termination lawsuit (Google it for more info).  In my 5 years I had 5 yearly reviews, I gained the title of systems architect after less than 4 years of service (incredibly rare, most architects have 6+ yrs.).

&amp;nbsp;

**Review Categories**

First let's go over what they tell you during Compass (which used to be 5 days long so maybe they skip it these days).  Cerner groups all associates into 5 categories based on a bell curve.  This means 75% or so of the company get's ""highly valued"".  

1. (I can't remember what this is called so let's call it ""thin ice"")
 1. No raise
 2. Can be considered a ""final warning"" and I believe you can be fired for almost any reason for 6 months after the review.
 3. I don't have much info on this because I don't know anyone who got this rating.
2. Needs improvement
 1. This usually means no raise or a very small one (0-1%).
 2. Ineligible for a level bump for 18 months (2 reviews)
 3. Ineligible for a transfer for 18 months
 4. You will be given a ""performance plan"" to assist with planning out goals to keep your job.
3. Highly valued
 1. This will usually include a 2-3% raise.  This is the ""you did an adequate job"" category.
 2. There is nothing special about this as a vast majority of the company gets this.
 3. Starting around 2012 there exists an unofficial ""Highly Valued+"" Which just means you did better than most but not good enough for Outstanding, usually means a slightly larger raise, up to 2% more.
 4. Along with HV+ there is a ""Highly Valued -"" which means you did not do well but not enough to punish you like how a Needs Improvement Does.  You will likely get a paltry raise and this can be seen as being on thin ice.
4. Outstanding
 1. This will usually include a 5-8% raise
5. Distinguished
 1. I do not know the details of this as I do not know anyone who ever got it.
 2. It can be assumed the raise benefit from Highly Valued to Outstanding continues to give an even larger raise

&amp;nbsp;

**Market Adjustments**

This is what Cerner calls it when the job market/inflation has increased the average pay for the job you do and they want to retain talent.  It's just a boost to your raise, these can be very large, like 10%.

&amp;nbsp;

**Level System**

Along with the review you need to know what the level system is.  It ranges from 8-1 (it used to be 7-1) with 1 being the highest and 8 being the lowest (sort of).  Beneath level 8 there are interns which have 2 levels of their own.  Level 8 is for people with associates degrees fresh from college.  Level 7 is for people with bachelor's degrees fresh from college, most new hires are placed into level 7.

&amp;nbsp;

**Pay Target**

Any associate's pay is determined by their title/position and their level.  Each title/position and level combo has a ""target"" pay.  for instance if my memory serves the target pay for a level 7 system engineer is $62,000.  Now bear in mind that doesn't mean you will be offered 62k because ""target"" is a poor choice of words.  The ""target"" should be called a soft limit.  The hard limit is always (target * 1.1) so in this example the hard limit is $68,200.  In other words the absolute maximum a level 7 engineer can make is $68,200.  These maximums come into play later when I explain why some people sit in the same job for 10+ years.  The ""target"" plays a role in raises because the further beneath target a person is the higher their raise will be in order to bring them closer to the target, but once near it or past it that stops.  So if two people have the same title-level combo but one makes less than the other they are likely to get a larger raise assuming similar performance.

&amp;nbsp;

**The Bucket of Reviews**

This is one of the worst things a HR department can enforce.  The Bucket works like this.  HR requires every section of the company complies with the bell curve.  To that end they enforce buckets of reviews on managers.  So for instance if you work on a team of about 20 the manager has to give at least 15 people highly valued, 1 person a needs improvement, and 1 person outstanding.  If they want to give a distinguished or a ""thin ice"" they have to go up a managerial level and take that from a larger bucket.  You can quickly see how this makes it so rockstars on crappy teams get great reviews but a team full of great people makes it VERY difficult to get ahead.  Don't dwell on this too much but bear in mind if you are performing less than the rest of your team you will likely get the ""needs improvement"".


&amp;nbsp;

**The Bucket of Money**

Managers also get a bucket of money to distribute as they see fit.  Of course it has to be approved by HR, so if someone on your team got a nice bump, you might have gotten less money because of it since the manager gave them more money instead of spreading it around.

&amp;nbsp;

**Banding**

Banding is what management calls it when review ratings are decided.  Usually in June/July (yeah, you don't get to know until September, stupid eh?)  Once reviews are decided, usually at a large level, like CWx region, they are sent to HR to approve.  Once HR approves in late July/August then wage banding occurs.  This means HR comes back with the raises it thinks everyone should get based on Banding, from there managers and executives can dispute and a back and forth occurs.  Once all is settled then final approvals come through in late August.

&amp;nbsp;

**Human Resources (HR) and Associate Relations (AR)**

HR is out to protect the company and save as much money as possible while not upsetting employees.  Standard way to look at it.  Associate relations is supposed to be there to help employees with HR related issues but most of the time it's pointless to contact them except for harassment and stuff.  At one point I was VERY unhappy with my pay and my manager offered to work with me and AR to get me a mid-year raise BUT it would remove my yearly review raise so whats the point?  It ended up being smarter to deal with it for the 9 months and instead get a large raise during yearly review.

&amp;nbsp;

**The Review**

The reviews are fairly straightforward.  You have to log your imperatives that show you have done work that aligns with upper management's ideals for the year (they change every year). Then you complete a self evaluation  which most managers don't read or skim.  Personally, I wrote a nice self evaluation in 2012 and saved it as a word doc, then just copy/pasted it every year after and changed a few things, no one noticed.  By the time you are sitting with your manager you should have a decent idea of how well you have done and know what to expect.  You will go over what you did well, areas you can improve, and large wins, any bad losses, etc.  You will usually not get your raise info until early/mid September.  Your manager will know it during the review but usually HR has not come back with their final approval yet so they never say to prevent getting hopes up.  If you did exceptionally well they may hint ""oh you will like your raise this year"" or something.

&amp;nbsp;

**Your Manager**

I worked in CernerWorks/Client Ops so I can only speak from that prospective.  The biggest thing to realize is your manager has 20ish people they manage on top of their own day to day work.  They can't keep track of every thing you do, one on one meetings are supposed to aid in this but most managers cancel them because other work is more important.  When you are new expect one on ones every 1-2 weeks at first, then they taper off to once a month, then every 8 weeks, then depending on manager on a case by case basis.  When I left my one on ones were only more like ad-hoc meetings when one of us needed something or we needed to talk about something and IM wasn't going to work.  Also bear in mind your manager is a person, and people can be crazy, have quirks, etc.  Treat them like a human and not like part of a cog in a terrible machine.

&amp;nbsp;

**Suggestions for Standing Out**

So how do you get ahead?  A few friends of mine figured out that the best way to get something in Cerner is just to ask.  Yeah. it's that simple.  In December/January have a one on one with your manager and outline what you want out of your next review.  Maybe it's a level bump, or a title change, or a large raise?  Tell your boss what you want and they will work with you to get it.  They will tell you if your aspirations are too high too.  Your boss is your friend during reviews, if you have a poor rapport with them, you're gonna have a bad time.  Do ""ands"" meaing you do your job AND this other thing.  Run a community, start sharing resources or notes, start teaching classes.  Doing things above and beyond just your ""job"" is how you get executive attention and better reviews.

&amp;nbsp;

**What Happened to Me?**

I had 5 reviews while at Cerner.  In order here is how things went down.  
I was hired in as a level 7 systems engineer straight out of college.

2. First review I had no idea what the process was like.  I was told good job with onboarding, got Highly Valued, and a 2.6% raise .  I talked with a lot of friends about it and we all got about the same thing.  We then started talking to some Cerner veterans on what to do for next year and got some good advice.

3. In January I told my boss at my next review I wanted a level bump and every single one on one I want to go over the things I have done to achieve that goal and go over anything I did wrong or could have done better.  In September I got the level bump and a ""market adjustment"" raise.  Total was something like 17% mostly due to the market adjustment with a Highly Valued+.

4. I did not talk to my manager this year, I set no expectations.  CernerWorks went through a re-organization and I got a new manager.  My review was very basic with a Highly Valued and a 3.3% raise.

5. In January I found out a friend of mine who had nowhere near my technical expertise was making almost 20k more than me despite being hired in at less than me.  Good for him, but I was upset (not at him but at my manager and myself for not doing anything in my previous review).  I spoke with my manager and almost engaged AR but at my manager's suggestion we decided not to and instead focus on my September review.  I laid out everything I wanted; a level bump to 5, a title change to systems architect, and a giant raise.  I worked hard for it and in every one on one laid out how I was doing work level 4 and 3 architects do.  My manager told me I will likely get the level bump but doing both a level and title change in the same review is almost unheard of.  September came around and I got everything.  An outstanding rating, a level bump to 5, a title change to Systems Architect, and a 25.7% raise.  I was like a pig in shit.  Most of that large raise was due to the title change, architects are the highest paid people before executives (give or take).

6. My final review.  I did not lay out any expectations because I knew I would be leaving the company and I had a very large workload.  September came and I actually got another outstanding along with a ~8% raise (I honestly can't remember the exact percent, I got the raise amount the week after I accepted an offer elsewhere).  Bear in mind all of those raises amount to around a 64% pay increase over 5 years, which is abnormal.  I did well at Cerner, better than most.

&amp;nbsp;

**Closing Thoughts**

Overall Cerner's review process is convoluted (personally I believe purposefully).  Very little information is shared for new employees and I believe it is to prevent them from getting paid better in an effort to save the company money.  Taking off the tin-foil hat, I enjoyed my time at Cerner and would not trade the experiences and friends I made there for anything.  Leaving Kansas City was a difficult decision for me simply because of the friends I made (I didn't like the city itself).  If you are offered a position at Cerner and you are fresh out of college, don't hesitate to take it.  Spend a few years getting your feet wet in the corporate world and then decide if Kansas City is the place for you.  But while you are with Cerner heed my advice and if you are good you can make good money.  Just find ways to distinguish yourself from the crowd and make a name for yourself.

**Privacy Request**

Now I finally have my chance!! I am 19 years old and currently attending college. I am lucky enough to have landed an internship this summer that will pay around $5,500, and will end at the end of July, giving me about 3 and a half weeks between the end of the internship and school starting again.

So; I have essentially 3 weeks, and a $5,500 budget, (though, I want to try to spend less than $3,000, if possible. This is of course very dependent on where I go). I plan on going to Europe, and want to try to go to 3, MAYBE 4 cities on this trip, if you guys think that's possible.

I know there are a lot of posts like this but I will break it to smaller questions and am extremely thankful for anybody to help me get an idea down for what I want to do. 

This is my list of places I'd like to see eventually in life: Budapest, Vienna, Amsterdam, London, Venice, Florence, Rome, Barcelona, Madrid, Copenhagen, Prague

Here are my questions:

1) If you could suggest a 3-4 city trip that makes sense distance wise as well as financially, which 3-4 would they be?

2) Is my budget reasonable considering I will be staying in Hostels?

3) My parents are very open towards anything adventurous, but still, what is the best way to convince them to let me go and to make sure they know I will be safe? Don't want them worrying about me.

I guess this is pretty relevant towards receiving advice too.. my goal in travelling is to immerse myself in as much culture as possible by meeting natives as well as other solo travelers and to be in and constantly explore cities with amazing architecture and history.

Overall, I would absolutely love hearing anything you guys have to say, whether it is criticism about my plan or not, thank you!"

I don't care about programmable buttons for WoW. (no offense to gamers, I'm trying to get efficient with my school work). I am looking for typing speed. I am trying to decide which color switch I should get. I've looked at these articles and this is the extent of my education on mechanical keyboards. A sturdy keyboard I could take with me and pull in and out a backpack would be a plus.
From my understanding, I want to avoid Cherry MX Red &amp; black and should consider Cherry MX Brown and Blue. I'll have a roommate and will be in public spaces so if a quiet model of a mechanical keyboard exists, that'd be helpful, although I don't think mechanical's have a rep for quietness. Being quite is a secondary priority as I'll move to a lobby if someone is trying to sleep.

Any other features to look for besides switch color would be appreciated. Also, I want my buttons to have symbols and am not ready for a Das Ultimate Keyboard. I am leaning to the Das Keyboard Model S Professional Mechanical Keyboard.

Budget isn't the biggest concern as long I can get the keyboard most suited for my needs on my first purchase. I know first purchases never work like that, but trying to get as close as possible. If I do well in my classes, I will be able to get better internships and work on side projects, so a good keyboard is a worthy investment.

I had an interview on Tuesday for a marketing analyst internship. The interview went extremely well and I hear by Friday if I got the job [fingers crossed!*]. The interviewer was a waitress in college and she was very interested to hear about my ""tip analysis""... which is honestly just me confirming suspicions with averages, percentages, etc.

I know that not everyone here is in college, looking for an internship, or even an internship that involves spreadsheets but I figured there would be enough to make this a relevant post. This has also been a great project in making me comfortable with excel and a bunch of the formulas I learned and immediately forgot in class.

Here's a [sample](http://imgur.com/rNIzHbQ) of what my data looks like.

To start off.. I truly like her and i've never felt this way about anyone before I've never been in what I would call love and this is either love or the closest i've ever been 


I say we have been seeing each other for 8 months but really we've only been talking that long... she says things didn't get serious till around May and not Feb. Regardless of when things got serious we have talked almost every single day since feb.


Things got more ""serious"" around May and we started hanging out more, Kissing (I know but its a step), expressing our feelings for each other, talking for hours on the phone, etc


Shes going through a lot, her grandmother just passed away a month ago, one of her uncles is sick, and another is battling addiction. Shes a grad student, working and an internship 


I know my time with her is limited and it has been from the start, I KNEW that going in and I'm ok with that, i really like her and eventually things will settle down and I can spend more time with her. Also I truly want to be there for her through everything shes going through.  


I met her family at her grandmothers wake... she tells me everything that goes on in her family, i listen i talk


Anyways about 2 weeks ago she ignored me for a whole weekend... I went crazy as we had just talked on the phone for an hour the night before and everything was good. She finally answered and said she hadn't talked to anyone all weekend and that she was sorry.. ok.. weird but ok


the following 2 weeks she was not her self, she would text me and stop texting and not text back, she didn't call (she always calls) she didn't say good morning or send kissy faces or any of the normal stuff she does... My mind went crazy... what did I do? whats going on? (I should have asked but I figured she was just busy it will pass)


Anyways 2 nights ago I asked if i could see her after the gym for 10 mins to give her something and she said yes and then about 40 mins later she basically said she was going to sleep. I was super excited to see her and figured she would be excited to see me.


This is where I handled it wrong and I know this. I told her ok I'll see you another day and she said no nvm I will stay up and I said its fine Im fine go to sleep.


She called and texted a few times but I was upset so I ignored her (yes Im an idiot) but it wasn't that she wanted to go sleep it was the accumulation of 2 weeks that just finally made me upset


Anyways the next morning she said it would be best if we are just friends


Her reasoning is she doesn't think she can give me what I want and make me happy and doesn't want the pressure on her and doesn't right now so she would rather be friends... and she also doesn't want to feel the way she felt when I ignored her (she ignored me for 3 days)


If I would have known how upset ignoring her would make her I wouldnt have but well here I am


I have figured out what is really going on


She says I'm the best thing that has happened to her in a long time and doesn't want me to get upset with her cause she doesn't have time to spend with me and then never talk to her again


So she wants me as a friend so i can be there and support her like I have been doing but as a friend so she doesn't have the added pressure of making me happy


Thats unfair to me no?


I told her I didn't know ignoring her would make her this upset and promised to never do it again and I meant that i really wont


I told her I understand she doesn't have a lot of time for me and I wouldn't be here 8 months later if I didn't know that and accept that


I told her I just wanted her to talk to me, thats all I need... I text here and there of hey how are you, good morning, good night, I'm fine with at... or hey I need a few days things are crazy... i would understand


She says its better as friends... so she wants me to be there but her not to have to be pressured into making time for me... i tell her thats not what I want


I do not want to be labeled a friend, I like her as more than a friend and I'll never escape the friend zone and either way once there she wont want to then lose me as a friend by complicating things


Shes been texting me all day today, even saying don't ignore me please talk to me when I didn't respond right away, she said she missed me, and said she still has feelings for me and that she couldn't sleep all last night


What do I do??? I don't want to give up... but i can make someone do something... we are meeting sunday morning to talk about it in person


bottom line is I like her to much to ever truly see her as just a friend and I know she feels the same way about me but shes scared to make the commitment and risk losing me so shes playing it safe... how do I convince her to take the leap of faith


TL;DR; I screwed up, she wants to be friends because she thinks its safe and she wont lose me if we are friends. 


Wow that was long... thank you in advance "
3ox01x,3,2015-10-15,Constantly getting torn apart.,CookiiMr,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3ox01x/constantly_getting_torn_apart/,"I'm 19 years old and live in Sweden,  
And the last 12 months has been tearing me apart constantly.  
I've suffered from depression ever since I was 15/16, but I can almost guarantee I've been pessimistic and negative for longer than that.  
Last year I got a skin condition which took around 5 months to diagnose as Psoriasis and ever since then, even tho treatment, I'm always scared of getting an outburst of red patches on my skin again, I still have some in my scalp but I can't bring myself to go and get it sorted.  
On top of that my grandfather got alzheimers and ofc it's only getting worse everday, and on top of that my grandmother (his wife) got diagnosed with cancer last year around christmas and around 4 months later passed away in front of my eyes.  
I dropped out of school because I couldn't deal with my grandmother passing away and everything, it was just too much, and now don't have a job, I have help from a job centre thing and may become an intern somewhere now but what do I know.  
And all of this is making me even more depressed and I went to seek help twice but got none.  
So it ends up with me sitting alone at home playing games to think of other things and as soon as I feel bad I start arguing with my girlfriend whom I've been with for a bit over a year and basically tearing us apart.  
I'm extremely scared of everything that can happen, I worry too much and overthink everything.  
Alot of friends pretty much ditched me because I got worse and that leaves me with even greater wounds inside because I can't deal with feeling abandoned.  
The only times I feel good is when I don't feel at all and those times are only when I get into a game too much or just go to London and just exist there (I go there frequently since my sister lives there) or go to a show/concert.  
I barely know what to do and I'm way to scared to get help with everything.  
I mostly just need a shoulder to lean on and someone to talk out all my thoughts with. But I only drag everyone down doing so.  
Most of the time I wish I wasn't alive.  "

I'm learning coding for additional skills such as python; like I really have no confidence with this type of resume

2. I actually chose engineering major due to job prospect and do not really have specific interest in this field. Due to this, I'm not sure how I'm supposed to carry on with the conversation.

3oxo0w,26,2015-10-15,Bad internship experience/accident negatively impacting grad school applications? [x-post /r/gradadvice],Kellab,biology,https://www.reddit.com/r/biology/comments/3oxo0w/bad_internship_experienceaccident_negatively/,"I originally posted this in /r/gradadmissions  but received no replies, I am hoping someone here will have some advice for me! 


I have gotten myself into a little bit of a situation...

To get the first details out of the way: I have my BSc (Hons) in biology and I am looking to get into a masters by research program in a particular lab. It is an ecology lab, so the field work is fairly intensive. The professor is also very well known in his field, so I am assuming I am going to have to REALLY stand out to be considered.

I have a decent amount of research experience. I worked for a number of professors in undergrad at a field station, helped teach field courses, and volunteered on a lot of projects. I did not jump right in to grad school after graduating because I really wanted to make sure I was giving myself the opportunity to try to get involved in something I was passionate about. I knew what I thought I wanted to study, but I wanted to get experience in the field just to make sure it was for me...and then move on to grad school.

I ended up getting a really amazing internship opportunity after graduating and I jumped right into it. It was my DREAM and I knew that I wanted to do my masters in that field. Everything was going amazingly, I had all sorts of awesome references lined up...and then there was a field accident. The field work I was doing had an inherent risk to it, but I was dealing with EXTREME and unpredictable circumstances, solo, on a daily basis (conditions I would not be dealing with for my potential masters). Eventually the inevitable happened and I ended up getting in a really bad situation, inches from dying more than once, and my supervisors DID NOT CARE. I was mocked for the traumatic event, instead of consoled, and told it was my fault (it was not). Looking back now, it was almost certainly ""intern abuse"", but I wanted to work in that field SO BAD and I was alone, in a foreign country...so I kept going. After the accident I kept working for 3 or 4 months, but it ended up taking quite a toll on me mentally.

I finished the research season, was very good at the field work, and presented the findings of my research to the public at the end of the project. The supervisors asked me to finish writing up an annual report to summarize the season some time in the following year, and I agreed. BUT--- when I went home, the full extent of what I went through hit me, and I could not even look at the report. I told them as much, but as I should have expected...they did not care and I have essentially lost those references. I tried SO HARD to get that report done, but it was not possible, and now it is more than too late. I have done a thesis before, and can and have completed many reports, but this report still haunts me.

It has been 2 years since my internship and I have been recovering in that time. I have gotten back to a point where I am ready to get back into the field again but I am terrified that my terrible internship experience will tarnish my applications to grad school. Because the lab is so competitive, I am guessing that my intern research experience in the field will be very important to highlight in my application, but I do NOT want to use them as a reference.

I know that academic references are usually much more important than professional ones when it comes to grad school, but with my internship being directly applicable to the masters I want to do...is this still true? Would it be generally acceptable to talk about my internship, but give references from my undergrad thesis and work instead? Should I just pretend my internship never happened? I am very worried that I will get talking to a professor, and they will want a reference from my internship and then my chances will be ruined. Is there a way to handle a bad reference? I had volunteers that helped occasionally with my project, could they be a reference? I suppose if asked, I could get into the ~whole story~ but that feels like it would scare a professor away more than anything.

Sorry for how long this got! I would really appreciate any guidance or advice on how I should approach applying! Thanks for your time!!

3oxwe1,2,2015-10-15,26M4F Unleash your inner bad girl; several prompts!,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3oxwe1/26m4f_unleash_your_inner_bad_girl_several_prompts/,"So I've got a soft spot for bad girls. ;)

I'm around all night and looking to get as filthy as possible. I've got several prompts below, but I'm also open to working a completely-different scene out as long as it stays away from my dislikes. When you respond, send me your likes/dislikes, too; I'm a giver, and it REALLY gets me off to know you're enjoying yourself as we do this.

Some prompts/ideas below:

1) It's your standard party scene. You pick the venue (night club, pool party, strip club, etc.), but regardless of the location, it's hopping, with booze flowing and scantily-clad women (and maybe men, too) running around looking absolutely perfect. Whether you're a partygoer, a bartender, a stripper/hooker, or any other role you can imagine, you're out tonight for one reason: To get fucked hard.

2) You're an intern at the office I work in. We don't deal with each other much, other than idle chit-chat. However, in my side job editing video for some shady clients, I notice a familiar face working a stripper pole and giving lap dances. It's you, and I wait until we're alone in the office to confront you with the evidence.

3) I've married an older woman and have entered into an open relationship. My new wife has a daughter younger than me, and you're her best friend. We've been thinking of you as a bad influence, but lately, my eyes have been more drawn to a body that's absolutely built for sex. You and my step-daughter come home late one night, and my wife isn't around.

4) I'm at the gym and can't concentrate. Every time I go, you're there, strutting your stuff in an ill-fitting sports bra and short shorts that barely constrain your juicy ass. You turn heads and you know it, and one day I work up the courage to introduce myself.

5) I've just moved into the neighborhood as a single guy, and my new place is right next door or across the street from you. This opens up a myriad of possibilities; maybe you're a college girl, a similarly-aged younger professional, or even a MILF, but either way, you eye the new single guy in the neighborhood and are curious.

6) Anything else you can think of that doesn't fit my dislikes!

My kinks: Big breasts/titfucking, bimbos/bimbofication, dirty talk (the raunchier the better), oral sex (giving and receiving), group sex, multiple orgasms/cumplay, bad girls (partying/drinking/smoking all encouraged).

My no-go's: Animals, bathroom stuff, blood/gore, heavy BDSM, incest, noncon.

Hope to hear from you!"
3oy9qy,8,2015-10-16,A list of things I want to tell my ex boyfriend.,Pintobean93,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3oy9qy/a_list_of_things_i_want_to_tell_my_ex_boyfriend/,"Everyday, I think about all the cool things I want to tell you. You were my best friend before we started dating. It feels so weird not to tell you the good, the bad, and the ugly in my life. I've known you for four years and especially the 3.5 years we dated, you were always the first to know everything. So here are the things I just want to text you and tell you about for the past few weeks, but I know I shouldn't be texting you. So here it goes...

* I got 100% on my math quiz today! I was so worried in the summer about taking a 400 level math class but I seem to be doing okay so far. I felt so satisfied getting that perfect score back.
 
* I've been dealing with CO-OP people this week. I'm hoping they can place me with an internship for the summer. So far, they have seemed impressed with how quickly I'm getting all my forms in and everything. I'm hoping this is a good sign.

* I had to get my resume critiqued at school today and it was really helpful. The guy I met with had some really great ideas. He also noticed all the math courses I had taken and wanted me to apply for an internship at the CIA. They are looking to recruit students for analytics. I would have to move to Washington D.C. if I got the internship. I don't want to move, but it made me feel good that people were encouraging me to go for big opportunities.  

* I'm being Snow White for Halloween! I thought it would be funny because I'm so pale and I've always wanted to be a Disney Princess for Halloween since I was a kid. You kept saying you wanted to go big for Halloween. I decided this was my year for a good costume. I can't wait to wear it, even though the dress is about a foot too long on me.

* I went out for K's birthday last weekend and I had the coolest drink of my life. It had sprite, berry vodka, and a lime freeze pop in it. I think that was the first time I'd ever been truly drunk. You always wanted to drink with me but we rarely did with our opposite schedules. All I could think about was how much you would have been laughing at drunk me. That's what you always wanted to see in me. Let loose. You missed it man. Props to me for not drunk texting you.

* Tinder is awful. Tried it for a week for laughs. Boy I'm not looking forward to when I'm ready for a relationship again.

* I can't believe it's been a month since we broke up. And almost a month since we spoke. I want to text you, but I know nothing has changed that would get us back together. We would still have the same issues since I'm pretty sure you're still working at the job that drove us apart. 

* I have days where I totally feel fine. Other days where I still cry. And days that I'm flat out mad. Mad that I put you first so often and looking back there were so many times you didn't take me into account. I hate that any time I get a text message, I hope it's you.

* I realize you need time to figure your own life out. The longer you wait, the further I'm sure I'll disconnect from you. You said you'd contact me in about a month to update me on what's happening in your life. But I doubt that will happen. I was always the one who made the effort to text and spark conversation between us and I feel like you'll hesitate to try to contact me. I'm here to listen, but I'm not sure how long that'll be.

I wish you value me enough to get your shit together. I love you so much. My main motivation in college was to get a degree, get a good job, so we could move in together. I got my life together because I wanted you in it so badly. I wish you could have done the same for me."

However, she said she accepted that a long time ago and that his entire family is like that.

I have grown more distant from him these past couple years as I became less negative. Usually, when I'm talking to my mom or siblings about something, he would interject and say something negative or just try to bring me down.

examples:

* He down plays the school I go to even though it's a top-20 school and it's better than any school anyone in our family goes to

* I get an internship at the second best company in my industry and he ""asks"" me why I didn't get it in the best company.

* I interned at a F500 company this summer and was talking to my brother about getting a part-time retail job over the school year. My dad overhears and tells me ""that that job step down from your last job"" (which it is since it's just a part-time retail job)

* He tells me I shouldn't exercise too much and to relax about eating healthy. He's overweight, eats sugary food all day, and hurt his back trying to show off by jumping and trying to touch the ceiling


The last time we talked was three months ago when we were at a resturant with the family. He spends the entire time on his phone and when he tries to take a picture of my brother and I, we didn't want to since we were eating. He curses and I tell him we (the family) are trying not to curse. He glares at me and calls me an ass. This isn't the first time he's called me something unsavory. He's also called me a prick, douche, douchebag, asshole, and various combinations of them.

When he said that, I looked at the ground and just said, ""this is why I try to avoid talking to you."" After that, I stopped talking to him. It's been three months and I think my life is a lot better now that we don't talk. It's a lot less stressful without him.

Once I leave the house, I kind of don't want him involved any way in my life.

Is this normal? Is this just a phase? Has anyone else gone through this?"

I recently accepted an offer for a winter internship with a decent sized regional firm and was very happy with the offer. However, I was recently contacted by a big 4 and did a phone interview and now I've been invited to office visits next week to interview for a summer internship. I feel like it's a bad idea to intern at two firms and I don't want to do anything to hurt my chances at a full time offer at the firm I've already committed to. I'm also not sure how either firm would look at me as another internship would add an extra semester on before I got to 150. What would be the protocol on this type of situation? "
3oyd7b,2,2015-10-16,Me [26M] have been out of dating for a year and a half after a devastating breakup with college gf [21F]. I have a history of depression and I need help.,Shortnessandpain,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3oyd7b/me_26m_have_been_out_of_dating_for_a_year_and_a/,"**Let me preface this with a little bit about me.** 

I'm not exactly attractive, I'm short (5'7), currently live in a very conservative and overall restrictive town (though not a small one) and have a lifelong history of depression and intimacy issues. For most of my life I felt was on a path to mediocrity and loneliness until I transferred to a great university and found people like me. It was a true revelation. 

Thing is, you wouldn't know that from meeting me. I make friends easy, I can be really social and I legitimately try my best to help others. I *know* when I control a room or am the life of the party and relish in it. People open up to me and trust my judgement. I'm a joker, a clown but also an adviser and mentor. I really love to make others laugh and I've always been told I seem like a very happy, well put together person. 

In the few relationships I've been in I have always been superman. The one to fix the issue, to make them feel better, to be the romantic as well as the man when I need to be and to walk with them through the harshest of times. I'm superman until I *can't* be. 

**The Relationship**

She [21 now] was the first girl that I feel I ever truly loved. She suffered depression the same as I did in the past but I was always able to pull her out of it. We dated the last year of my time at college and tried distance a bit after. It was truly a great relationship when I had it but finances (I paid for my own schooling with work, aid and scholarships) and other factors forced me to retreat to my hometown. Having to leave my college, my respite from the life I knew prior and the one person I truly loved was one of the worst days of my life. 

While the experience devastated me to the core, it absolutely broke her when I had to go. She loved me and was suffering so many other setbacks in her academic and professional life at school. I talked to her every day after that just trying to put her back together. My life was in shambles, the economy in this city isn't built for much beyond manual labor and retail and even then there were no jobs open. I was poorer than I had ever been and no car to travel to the city and manage work there. Still, I would do craigslist video work and other small jobs to save and find ways to see her. When she came down for a weekend I called in favors to pretty much hitch my way to her for just a day. I used what little money I had to buy a plane ticket to her campus and spend a week with her when she seemed almost at her worst. Her safety and well being was of paramount importance to me and I knew mine was hers as well. 

Funnily enough, this was working. She picked herself up, made changes in her life and was doing great. I was so happy for her, it was what I wanted. However, my life started falling apart even worse. My grandma fell ill and suffered a massive heart attack. She was a horrible woman, put my family through so much but my dad needed someone to help, he still didn't want her to die. 

I had basically become her nurse while I tried looking for work. She is the perfect example of the worst kind of welfare mother and would wake up every hour or two screaming about how she regrets everything about her life and she wanted to die. I was in such conflict, no money, job prospects, in a long distance relationship and helping a person I despised but did not want to see dead. I still wanted to help. I was living with my grandmother until she recovered but it felt like the longest period in my life.

My girlfriend seemed like she was with me through all of this, through my low time. Then she started getting distant. Then, when I would express myself and the pain I was going through, she wouldn't know how to help. One day she finally told me that we need to stop talking, that she doesn't know who I am anymore and that maybe one day we'll talk again in the future. I asked her why she didn't bring it up before and she just said that she didn't want to make things worse. **She left me, through a text, at the lowest point I had ever been in my entire life.** 


My depression came back worse than it had ever been. I became a recluse and would constantly attack myself mentally, break myself down and remind myself why I deserved to be where I was at. I lost everything. 


2 months later (May of last year) I found a job doing cold calls for the sales department at a marketing company. I slowly started picking myself up, this little bit of money I had allowed me to buy a new phone and some food. My family has never done well financially but I was finally able to help out. After a while I got promoted and moved to a more career relevant department. 


The office looked at me as the life of the party, the happy guy (They still do). I started buying plane tickets every once in a while to see my college friends (different mentality from hometown friends, felt more like myself) and helped keep the ones who did graduate and find nothing sane while they moved back home in towns near where I am. My grandmother recovered and, of course, distanced herself from us. I even hooked up with someone at a party in the big city and started going interviews at different companies for similar jobs with higher pay. 


*However* the depression never left me. I still found ways to keep myself in check, to stop myself from being happy. I'd have zones of being out in the world and social (though still in tremendous pain) and then times of absolute hermit behavior. I couldn't find a way to be happy for myself and even though I had that hook up, I still told myself that it was a fluke and that no one really wanted me, at least romantically. The interviews to leave this town had not worked out and I gave up on that too, stopped visiting college friends for some time as well. 

**Somehow, though, things have changed.** 

Recently I decided to just stop it. To stop putting myself through so much anguish for no reason. I reconnected with a lot of friends with school, have been doing amazingly at work and have been trying my best to save for a car (parents always needing money makes that a slow one). I'm leaving town more, stopping my own indulgences and eating healthier. I had spent a lot of time as  a bit of a stoner, hiding behind weed in my worst moments to not feel the pain of being sober but I've since even quit that and feel fantastic. Much better physically and have more energy. 

I honestly just want to be better. I realized how much of a badass I was in my school prime and how far I had come from what I was before. I realized that I can be that again. I mean, I did non stop work, internships and double majoring all throughout school and still had a bitchin' personal life. I am working toward putting myself in a new environment and am applying to jobs in the big city while keeping money aside for a car that I desperately need. I am *fucking done* hating myself.

**But still**

The only thing that is hindering this is my intimacy issues. I don't know what it is but I don't know what to do about dating. I still don't see myself as attractive, at all. The car issues makes the actual dating part of this seem impossible and overall I just can't seem to put myself in that state. I still think about her from time to time, not like I used to and it does NOT result in downward spirals anymore but I think about the pain of it all and about being superman again for someone else and I just can't seem to put myself back out there. Recently, I skipped a perfect opportunity to ask someone out I thought was cute as hell, casual and of no real consequence yet I couldn't bring myself to just ask to go out for a drink or something. 

As many of you know, depression doesn't exactly leave you and you always battle it but I can safely say that I'm turning myself around tremendously. I've found myself being genuinely happy again without the footnote of hurting myself. I'm really doing my best to change my mentality on everything and have been doing something every day to make my life better. Be it writing, going out with friends, cleaning up resume or just checking in with my important friends to make sure all is well in life. 

I just, for the life of me, can't put myself out there anymore. The thing is, I really want to. I fantasize about the feeling of holding someone again. Not just sex and casual shit, but really having that close connection. I long for intimacy yet I still feel weird when someone even hugs me. 

So those who have suffered depression, who have been out of the game for a long time and have put yourselves back together and actually conneted with someone: Please, what do I do? How did you do it? 

I think I'm afraid of not being good at intimacy anymore and such so what was that experience like after such a time away (It's been a few months since the hookup, was pretty drunk)? 

In my attempt to do something every day to make me a better person this is my task for today and it's an important one. I need to find a way to get out of my head and be the man that I know I can be again. Do you guys have similar experiences? Did you ever reconcile? Me and the gf in subject haven't spoken since the day we fell apart.

I realize this is probably long as hell even for this subreddit so I thank anyone that replies for even reading it. I want to turn my life around and thank you for trying to help. 
   
**tl;dr**: College gf abandoned me at my lowest (after me supporting her through hers) and I've slowly been putting myself back together. I want to try to put myself out there again but don't know where to start, how to fix my depressive mind. What did you do to get yourself back out there?"

Honestly I didn't want to come here for help, because it feels like defeat, like I can't take care of my shit on my own. But I really need some help and some motivation so here it goes.

Last year I was doing really well in college and people knew me as the guy who was involved in all kind of activities. I never had the best body, but because of my social status I was quite confident.
I met this girl who after some flirting told me she was really into me. This wasn't the reason she wanted to have sex with me immediately, because she didn't want to rush things. I thought it was just an excuse to not have sex, because she was way hotter than I am, but she told me the truth. We had sex for a couple of weeks and eventually got into a relationship. This relationship ended 4 months later because the atmosphere between us sucked. After we broke up we remained friends, and as friends we went along quite well. She got into a sort of relationship with someone who left the country for an international internship short after, so now we're both single and still friends.

Since we broke up we didn't have any sex anymore, which didn't bother me as much because she had someone else. Now, we are both single, there is still some attraction between us and she is still hot. So I made a move and found out she didn't want to have sex with me. Ouch. This sucked but I got over it, but my confidence is messed up right now.

Now I know she has sex with other guys, but nothing serious. She sends me a lot of snaps that I know she sends them to a lot of other people as well (because they're never really personal or directed at me). This past month she's been working out a lot and today she sent me a snapchat of her sexy flat belly. FUCK.

I finally got over her, finally got over the thought of having sex with super hot women instead of 'less hotter' ones, and now I'm totally fucked up because I want to have sex with her again, or at least someone as equally as attractive as her.
I still don't have a good body (I look way younger than I am) and thus my confidence is not good enough to go after other hot women. This makes me go back to porn and fapping, which isn't really helping either.

I know it doesn't have a lot to do with NoFap, but I couldn't think of another place for some advice and motivation to start changing things in my life. Please help me."
3oz2ko,7,2015-10-16,[Discussion/Spoiler] I need opinions..,animemiki,htgawm,https://www.reddit.com/r/htgawm/comments/3oz2ko/discussionspoiler_i_need_opinions/,"Started watching this show day one and I LOVE IT! 
But I have a lot issues with her interns. 

What Conner did leaking that info was a bullshit move. I get letting that psycho chick run free was against his moral judgement but they are studying to be **LAWYERS**. Defending the innocent or guilty is part of the job. But all that aside, what he said to Annalise ""Wes Killed your husband.. and he only did it cause you messed with his head"" I mean.. what the hell, he isnt the only one who seems thing this among them. (Referring to that discussion Conner had with the others) AK did everything for them and she certainly didnt have to. How does this make you feel? This lady put her life, her career EVERYTHING on the line for these kids. Yet somehow, they make her seem like the bad guy, the crazy bitch that kills left and right to win. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure she has a crazy shady past (they all do) probably even killed someone at some point. But I don't believe for one second it was out of cold blood (I hate you so I'll kill you kinda thing) 


Then Wes going behind everyone's' back to prove what? That ""AK"" did it? We as the audience know she didnt, but what exactly does he intend to do with that info? He finds out BonBon (this was sooo cute) did it and what? Tell the ex-boyfriend? The kid killed Sam and nearly had Nate go to prison for it. Oh yea, that'll totally go over well.  (Yes, i know Wes wasnt the one who framed but Nate wont see it that way) So, I vented and shared my strong opinions here are my questions:

- Do you think Conner is right? Am I wrong for defending the woman who risked everything for these kids? Like Bonbon asked before in season ""Why are you helping them?""

- What about wes? Going behind the scenes to dig up dirt on the woman who protected his life, future, career... you name it. 
Also why does he seem so damned determine to prove AK did it? (Might just be me.. but thats how it looks) 

- Does anyone feel really bad for annalise? Everywhere she turns, people are calling her a murderer, monster, brain washer. You saw in her relationship with the lawyer chick that she feels that she is ""poison"" and a ""ruiner"" ~~not a word cant think of anything else~~ of things, of people. 

Side note: From the looks of it, it doesnt seem like any of the interns shot Ak. But how would you feel if it actually turns out to be them? (I think I may actually lose my shit)  But anyway, I'd love to hear what you guys think, enlighten me on your own theories/opinions :D  "
3ozj0p,3,2015-10-16,Claiming an Exemption/Allowance at new job.,foufuego,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3ozj0p/claiming_an_exemptionallowance_at_new_job/,"So I'm trying to fill out the paperwork for a job that I'm starting next week. My annual gross income is $44,800 and there are 5 pay periods left in the year. Based off of this, I've calculated that I would earn around $9333 by the end of the year.

However, I've had two more jobs this year. The first one was an $8/hr internship that I did during my final semester ($1,600 total in gross income). And the other one is a job that I'm still working part-time and it pays $10/hr (a total of $6,000 by Dec. 31). I should have made a total of $16,933 by the end of the year for all three jobs. My filing status will be single.

For some reason, no taxes were taken out of the last two jobs. Since I know I'll owe taxes from those two jobs, I'm trying to calculate how much I would owe and whether or not it would be worth it to claim zero exemptions/allowances from my new job. I don't even know what tax bracket each job would fall under (i.e. is each job taxed separately based off of their gross income or do I add up the income from all of my jobs to determine my tax bracket?). Also, would it be more beneficial if I filed as a dependent under my mom? I would say that we provided equal support to myself this year...so either one of us should be able to claim me. Sorry if this is confusing. I'm trying to make as much sense out of the situation as I possible can. I just want to avoid having to pay back $1,000+ in taxes when I file.


Edit: I forgot to mention this earlier...I've been uninsured for the entire year because I couldn't afford to get on a plan (and neither could my mom who earns about $22k a year and has two dependents). I won't have access to health insurance until I start this job. From my understanding there is a penalty for not being insured. Would I have to pay this penalty if I were only insured for 2 months in 2015?"

In the Netherlands, software engineers are more often seen as costing money rather than making money. It's not a good situation, and doesn't seem to be changing any time soon.

Is it a good idea to work in the United States? If so, how do I find work there? I know that this is a decision that should not be taken lightly, so for now, I'm trying to gather information about this.

But i'm sure there are alot of people who have knowledge of said issue. I'm not here initially to get an answer to fix the problem, but rather i want to know why this problem is occuring or what could it be. 

So in my house i have two television decoders, one upstairs and one downstairs. Last week the decoder upstairs stopped working and i encountered a blue screen. First thing i did was resetting and rebooting the decoder, which didn't worked. Then i took the power supply from downstairs and plugged it in the decoder upstairs, suprisingly this worked! So i called my television provider to provide me with a new power supply. 

Today i received the power supply and plugged it in the decoder down stairs which i couldn't use for several days. The television worked again! Unfortunately a few hours later when i wanted to turn my television back on same problem occured. Blue screen, nothing seems to work, however when i use the upstairs power supply the decoder works again. What is causing the power supply to fail two times? I know there is a small chance that such event can happen twice from a manufacturing error, so there must be something intern in the decoder perhaps? that is causing the power supply to stop from working?

Thanks in advance!

Most of the family that I live near is on my dad's side after his dad remarried. Most of them never so much as contact us unless it was for some short 'hello' on the holidays or when someone died and there was a funeral. They seem totally content to ignore us for 99.9% of the time, unless someone important happened to them. They don't treat everyone else in the family like that but it seems like they don't give a shit about us because we have no blood relation. 

I graduated about half a year ago and they keep pressuring me to get a job in accounting since I got my degree in that, but when I tell them that I was depressed when I was doing that as an intern, no one wants to listen. No one wants to believe that I would cry myself to sleep or that I was sitting on the kitchen floor one night, staring at the butcher's knife in my hands. No one wants to believe that I was miserable doing what I was doing and that I thought of suicide almost daily. 

It feels insulting when my grandmother scoffs at the idea that I think about suicide or when my aunt keeps telling me that I choose to be this way and that I should just change myself. Is it just better to cut off ties to your family at some point?"
3p1x8k,1,2015-10-16,My roommate's international boyfriend [22 M] is taking over my work space and hindering our friendship [both 22F]. What do I do?,Limesanddimes,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3p1x8k/my_roommates_international_boyfriend_22_m_is/,"I just moved to NYC a month ago to live with my really good friend from college. She's living with her father who owns a large home so she invited me to live in one of their guest rooms while she's in the city for a 3 month internship. I work from home so I happily agreed to move here rent free so we could hang out and be in the city together since she normally lives abroad. Until last week we've been having a great time.  

HOWEVER, last week her boyfriend arrived from England.  He's living with us for a month (my friend only wanted him to come for a couple weeks but he insisted on longer..) 

I'm already running into some issues. Firstly, my roommate works a typical 9-5 and since I work from home, it's just me and her bf all day. He can't work in the country (but says he's looking for volunteer work ) and he has no other friends so I feel obliged to entertain him/take him around the city. When I try to work, he's always in the common areas and although he's a nice guy, he's constantly talking. It's been really effecting my work schedule.

Aside from my work, I'm concerned because since his arrival last week, I don't get any alone time with my friend which is why I moved to the city. I'm constantly 3rd wheeling when we go out and forcing myself to interact with her bf. I feel guilty for feeling so selfish but it wasn't my intention to move to such an expensive city with my best friend just to be put on the back burner. 

I'm at a point where I'm serisouly considering moving back home with my parents 10 hours away and returning when he leaves. I know my friend would be upset but I don't feel it's worth it for me to stay and constantly be annoyed at my situation with her bf around all the time. I also feel like I'm stressing her out because she can tell I'm annoyed with him.  

What do you think I should do? Wait it out three more weeks or return when he's gone since he obviously won't be leaving anytime sooner? Thank you for your help!!

I'll post the rules again.

***

#How to participate

Participating in the game is done purely through Private Messages so as to not spoil the game for anyone else.

Each week, everyone gets 4 turns, and in each turn, each person can use 3 actions. The possible actions to use are as follows:

* Guess 1 card for 1 pose

* Request for 1 hint for 1 pose (Maximum of 2 per pose, the first hint will give the attribute, the second hint will give the rarity; you can't specify the hint, the first one given will always be attribute, i.e. You can't be given the Rarity hint before the Attribute hint)

So a single turn within a PM would look something like this (if the poses drawn are labelled A, B and C):

&gt; 1)	Guess: A: #88 Kotori unidolised

&gt; 2)	Guess: B: #168 Maria (either unidolised or idolised would be accepted in this case since they’re the same pose)

&gt; 3)	Hint: B

So, for example, for a single turn, you could take one guess for each pose, or focus on one pose at a time and give three guesses, or ask for 2 hints for one and guess another, etc. I've decided to do the turns like this so that people don't just guess randomly, they have a limit to how many they can guess, which should make it slightly easier for me as there'll be less guesses. People who guess without hints get more guesses since it will be more difficult than with hints. If people guess one card quickly, they're rewarded by having more guesses for the other ones.

My response to the example PM would be along the lines of:

&gt; 1)	Correct +3 (See more about scoring in the next section)

&gt; 2)	Incorrect

&gt; 3)	B: Attribute: Smile

(Sorry if it seems blunt and non-conversational, it will possibly (and hopefully) be quite busy)

Please don’t discuss answers in the comments so it isn’t ruined for anyone, but feel free to ask questions about the rules in the comments if you are unsure of something or if you need me to clarify anything.

I’m aware that some cards have very similar poses, but only the one used for drawing it will be accepted as correct so if you happen to get a similar one which could also pass for the same pose given, then it’s tough luck. The only exception to this is the first cards of each of the Normal cards which have the same pose for both idolised and unidolised (for most of them).

The poses can be for literally any of the cards in existence, including Normals, Teachers, Support cards, and even Alpacas.

***

#Scoring

The way these are scored is as follows:

Correct guess if given no hints: +3

Correct guess if given 1 hint: +2

Correct guess if give 2 hints: +1

If you correctly guess all 3 cards, you will receive bonus points based on the number of turns you achieved this in. So if you take 1 turn you earn 3 bonus points, 2 turns gives you 2 bonus points, etc. This scoring rule was made to further separate the top scorers.

This allows a maximum score of 12 per week. I will (attempt to) keep track of the scores and post the top rankers each week with cumulative totals.

If in a single turn, you spend one action on guessing a card and another action on requesting a hint for the same card, and you were correct with your guess, you will earn the points rewarded from before the hint since the actual guess was made without the hint.

***

I’ll respond to answers as soon as I can but please be aware I may have other stuff to do so may not be able to respond immediately, though I hopefully shouldn’t have too many other commitments.

Also, I’ll have to sleep sometime, so there probably won’t be any responses between about 1:00 UTC and 9:00 UTC on the following day.

***

Here are the poses for this week:

[Pose A](http://imgur.com/R48TH7q)

[Pose B](http://imgur.com/HAQxaLA)

[Pose C](http://imgur.com/eUG2crf)

If a part of the body is hidden behind the main body, head, hand or foot then I will draw it behind clearly. However, if a part of the body is hidden behind a limb or item of clothing, then unless it's obvious where it should go, I will make an attempt to predict where it should go, though if I do make a guess like this, I will draw it in red. Therefore, if you see red in a picture, that body part is not visible on the actual card and is even open to interpretation, since my guess may not be correct, though I try to make it seem natural.

When submitting answers, please give the message the subject of 'Guess the card - Week 9' or something along those lines so it will be easier to differentiate from other weeks, try not to post it as a reply to last week's guess, I just find it confusing... Also, when guessing in subsequent turns, please guess in a reply within the message thread of your original message so that it's easier to keep track of for me since I can quickly work out how many points you earn. (It should also be easier for you as well since all your hints and guesses will be in the same place)

**I'm going to bed straight after posting this so don't expect any responses until about 8 or so hours after posting this. (Maybe even 9 or 10 since I need to catch up on some sleep and have an online interview tomorrow for a summer internship which I probably shouldn't be tired for)**

Anyway, good luck!

Cersei Lannister: I'd love to play a guard that she takes a liking to and is actually able to 'make' her do things that she wouldn't normally. She likes his assertiveness and the fact that he is unafraid to tell the queen to bend over like a common whore, or get on her knees and swallow no matter how little she cares to do so.

Daenerys: For her, I'd love to play someone that can take her away from her 'Queenly' state and make her feel like a dirty young girl again. Whether that's one of her closest bodyguards, a trusted adviser, or a soldier for her army..... or maybe she gives her body up as a prize to a much needed ally perhaps?

Shae: After all that she did? I just want to treat her like a whore at the whorehouse.... Is that so much to ask?

Others:
Arya Stark, Catelyn Stark, Margaery Tyrell

---House of Lies---

Jeannie: Obvious one here, but I'd play almost anyone against her in some fashion. A new boyfriend that is truly her baby daddy... A past fling coming back in to her life and wooing her .... A booty call on a business trip that turns in to something slightly more serious.... Etc etc!

Monica: She needs a nice young stud to keep her busy, doesn't she? I'm thinking an intern that she tries to belittle and finally wants to ease a bit of tension and then realizes just how big of a boy he is ... and it draws her to him more and more even if they really don't get along on a personal level.

Others: April, Sarah Guggenheim, Marisa McClintock, Brynn

---The Office---

Pam Beesley: Something without Jim would be fantastic. Whether she's desperate at her apartment after breaking up with Roy that she'll give herself up to the landlord for more time/lesser rent... Maybe she's lonely and lets a warehouse guy take her for a ride that she can't help but want to relive on a nearly daily basis? Or an intern that she catches taking a liking to her and who knows where they go from there!

Jan: Another cougar that needs a young man. She's shown many times over that she loves interns and younger men in general!

Erin: Someone very dominate for her since she seems to be unsure/innocent... and she needs somebody that can break her of that streak.

Kelly: I have a feeling that she'd use just about anyone to make Ryan jealous. Let's give her a new person to do just that with. We can figure out if he's a perfect fit for her or just a guy with a dick that can shut her up for a few minutes at a time while they do some dirty things with one another!

Others: Angela, Meredith, Holly Flax....

Feel free to toss almost anyone else at me too as I'm sure I've missed some! Looking for something potentially long-term but I'm more then happy with just doing one scene if you'd rather go that route!"
3p2e3f,1,2015-10-16,26M4F Unleash your inner bad girl; several prompts!,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3p2e3f/26m4f_unleash_your_inner_bad_girl_several_prompts/,"So I've got a soft spot for bad girls. ;)

I'm around all night and looking to get as filthy as possible. I've got several prompts below, but I'm also open to working a completely-different scene out as long as it stays away from my dislikes. When you respond, send me your likes/dislikes, too; I'm a giver, and it REALLY gets me off to know you're enjoying yourself as we do this.

Some prompts/ideas below:

1) It's your standard party scene. You pick the venue (night club, pool party, strip club, etc.), but regardless of the location, it's hopping, with booze flowing and scantily-clad women (and maybe men, too) running around looking absolutely perfect. Whether you're a partygoer, a bartender, a stripper/hooker, or any other role you can imagine, you're out tonight for one reason: To get fucked hard.

2) You're an intern at the office I work in. We don't deal with each other much, other than idle chit-chat. However, in my side job editing video for some shady clients, I notice a familiar face working a stripper pole and giving lap dances. It's you, and I wait until we're alone in the office to confront you with the evidence.

3) I've married an older woman and have entered into an open relationship. My new wife has a daughter younger than me, and you're her best friend. We've been thinking of you as a bad influence, but lately, my eyes have been more drawn to a body that's absolutely built for sex. You and my step-daughter come home late one night, and my wife isn't around.

4) I'm at the gym and can't concentrate. Every time I go, you're there, strutting your stuff in an ill-fitting sports bra and short shorts that barely constrain your juicy ass. You turn heads and you know it, and one day I work up the courage to introduce myself.

5) I've just moved into the neighborhood as a single guy, and my new place is right next door or across the street from you. This opens up a myriad of possibilities; maybe you're a college girl, a similarly-aged younger professional, or even a MILF, but either way, you eye the new single guy in the neighborhood and are curious.

6) Anything else you can think of that doesn't fit my dislikes!

My kinks: Big breasts/titfucking, bimbos/bimbofication, dirty talk (the raunchier the better), oral sex (giving and receiving), group sex, multiple orgasms/cumplay, bad girls (partying/drinking/smoking all encouraged).

My no-go's: Animals, bathroom stuff, blood/gore, heavy BDSM, incest, noncon.

Hope to hear from you!"
3p34ds,44,2015-10-17,"I don't have any real friends, this probably gets posted everyday.",FUCKFACED_REPOSTER,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/3p34ds/i_dont_have_any_real_friends_this_probably_gets/,"Yeah I bet this gets posted every day but whatever, I'm going to post here anyway who cares.

I don't talk to anyone or have any meaningful conversations.
I'm a sophomore in college and every time I try to make friends with someone, the conversations go fine but for some reason once I am done talking with them, they forget I exist. What I mean by that is if I have a 20 minute conversation with someone I sit next to, if I come into class the next day they won't even say hi. I've tried saying hi first, but if we have a conversation the same thing repeats and I'm forgotten the next day, not that it matters, all my conversations sound like I'm forcing the person to talk like a dentist working on your teeth. I'm not sure why, when I was in high school I had plenty of conversations and felt like I was talking to people, I don't know what happened in college. 

I was an intern and the conversations I had with my co-workers felt like I was talking to people, so I don't think its my fault to be honest. 

Well to ramble on more, I really have no one to talk to meaningfully, I don't text anyone, the most I come to having a real conversation is with my professors asking simple questions about deadlines and that's it. I don't hang out with anyone, no one asks me to hang out with them, anyone I've asked to hang out with me in the past always has an excuse to not to.

 Sometimes I do go to parties with my mom for holidays at her friends house and there are people my age but I know I am the black sheep, there are about 7 of them I could talk to but none of them ever include me in any of their conversations or make any steps to do so, so I always feel left out, despite knowing them since I was in elementary school and have been on plenty of trips with them.

I used to talk to a lot of people online in mmos I played but now most of the people I've seen are either toxic or have their own dedicated clique that is impossible to get into, pushing away every person that isn't in their squad. 

Just to rant on more, I literally don't have anyone to text or chat with, I hate it when people say oh they have no friends but they really do, the same kind of people who are usually act like the ""quite person"" who rejects anyone who wants to try to talk to them. So what I mean is these people with no friends usually actually do have at least someone to talk to, to be honest I really don't, if I go through my recent texts they're only from google verification, my mom asking me yes or no questions, or my bank verification.

I think there is more I can say but I don't want to do more stupid shit. I think I will keep this post up and edit it to keep my thoughts maybe like some sort of journal.

This post is probably horribly formatted and riddled with grammatical errors. Even if it isn't this post will probably get down voted or I will get a lot of hate with it. I really don't blame anyone who downvotes these kind of posts, they probably get posted every other day here. I usually hate these kind of posts also since they're just in the wrong place or they're just pathetic to look at, I don't know what. I'm just posting here to express my thoughts in the hope that maybe someone can relate or feel better about themselves. Thanks for reading this far if you actually did read this. I don't know why anyone would read up to this part though, if I was browsing the subreddit this is the kind of post that I downvote without a second thought."
3p3cf9,2,2015-10-17,Would any of you look over my resume for me?,SHIT_PROCRASTINATOR,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/3p3cf9/would_any_of_you_look_over_my_resume_for_me/,"Junior in college here, looking for summer internships. Somehow I've made it this far in college without ever having a resume, so I really want to get this done so I can start sending out applications.

[Here it is](http://i.imgur.com/3G9afI2.png). Sorry about the obnoxious names, it's 4:30 am here on the east coast and I'm tired.

I know I have a strong mathematical background and that's easy enough display. However, I have pretty much no leadership experience or other extracurriculars to talk about, so I tried to fill the space with my work experience. Also wanted to get across the idea that I have good communication skills and experience working with other people. 

Any and all suggestions are greatly appreciated, be as mean as you need. If you have ideas on how to reword certain lines I'd really like to hear them. "

Pam Beesley: Something without Jim would be fantastic. Whether she's desperate at her apartment after breaking up with Roy that she'll give herself up to the landlord for more time/lesser rent... Maybe she's lonely and lets a warehouse guy take her for a ride that she can't help but want to relive on a nearly daily basis? Or an intern that she catches taking a liking to her and who knows where they go from there!

Jan: Another cougar that needs a young man. She's shown many times over that she loves interns and younger men in general!

Erin: Someone very dominate for her since she seems to be unsure/innocent... and she needs somebody that can break her of that streak.

Kelly: I have a feeling that she'd use just about anyone to make Ryan jealous. Let's give her a new person to do just that with. We can figure out if he's a perfect fit for her or just a guy with a dick that can shut her up for a few minutes at a time while they do some dirty things with one another!

3p5hjm,8,2015-10-17,[CREATIVE] My last memories,Kedamos,starcitizen,https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/3p5hjm/creative_my_last_memories/,"First attempt at creative wrinting in english. As you can expect, I would love to have feedback. :) Special kudos to /u/Oakenboken for giving me the boost I needed with your story :)

&amp;nbsp;

Seeing my current situation, I think it's a good idea that I write down everything that happened to me. Maybe nobody will read it but that will keep me occupied.

At the time, I was working as an IT guy in one of the many MISC factories. My job was to install the computer system and give a temporary Id to the ships that were going out of the production chain. After two years, if I remember correctly, I passed an intern contest and got a promotion. I became a dev !

That changed a lot for me. I had to move out to Terra, doing my first travel in space. I know it sounds normal for a lot of people and it was too when I was doing it. But it was a first for me and I have to say that I've loved it, even though nothing really happened.

So, I was a part of the dev team that were working on the computer system installed in the Freelancer series. Writing code was one of my passions so I loved that experience. I even worked on a small part of the system dedicated to the MIS variant. And I can say that it's so much different that the civilian version. Everything was great : good pay and a nice apartment way to big (well, not that big but still) for my needs. But one day, I quit. 

Why ? I wanted to go explore the verse ! When you're spending most of your time in the simpod, or looking at the Ark Starmap, at one point, it's not enough. You have to see the world yourself.
So, I quit my job and used a part of my savings to buy a Hull-A with a hauler license and started hauling. At the beginning, things weren't to shiny like I've hoped at the time. When you're knew to the market, finding good contract is harsh. But I managed it. And also, it was awesome ! Having my own ship, feeling the powerplant vibrate during the startup sequence, hearing the thruster screaming when I was going full burn.. It was a blast.

After one week, the exaltation passed and I started to think about how to become better. Firstly, I learned to repair my ship myself, and I also updated the software running in it. It was a tuned down version of the Freelancer software so, for me, modifying it was a piece of cake.
Outside of the ship's improvement, I changed the route I was taking. It was more dangerous but also more rewarding so I took the risk.
As you may think, everything didn't go as planned all the time. I've never lost my Hull to pirates but it happened that I had to drop a chunk of my cargo to get away alive. One day I dropped a box of nitroglycerin, deactivating the stasis field at the same time. Seeing your aggressor explode is always a pleasure.

I had a good reputation. It wasn't much compared to others but for me it felt so great. Finding good contracts became easier and credit started to pile up in my account. So I stepped up my game and bought a Hull-B. Even with the B I managed to keep the same route without being attacked. You see in my spare time between two cargo runs, instead of going to the bar I was tinkering. One of the devices that was the most useful to me was a small cube that emitted a Vandull scythe signature when activated. It helped keep the cargo snatchers away.

But I became too confident and one day, I fucked up..."

3p7ogs,7,2015-10-18,Me [32 F] in a long distance marriage with my husband [ 33 M] - unsure of our future,CheckingThisOutIn,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3p7ogs/me_32_f_in_a_long_distance_marriage_with_my/,"I dated this guy I met in the first year of college. Over time he became a part of our family (our families lived in the same town we went to college in) and my life. We have several common friends and we have holidayed and vacationed together many times.

A year after finishing college we became a bit of a long distance/commute couple as my boyfriend switched jobs and towns while I stayed put, working in the town I grew up in.

He was actively pursuing a marketing career and I don't think he was running away from me - he was usually a 4 hour commute away and we met every other week or so.

Our respective parents funded our college education at the state college so were both debt free and lucky that we not looking at jobs just to pay down debts and living costs.

Then came his big break - he got admitted to a specialized, well-known communications school (Annenberg in LA) and obviously and understandably wanted to take it up. His parents willingly funded the education (his family is comfortable) though he did have a little saved up. 

LA was a whole new challenge for me. While I really liked the city, my company would not transfer me to LA and I could not find a job of my choice in LA, immediately. 

So, I decided to join grad school as well (with funding from my parents, again) along with interning and trying to find stable work opportunities. 

I enrolled for my masters in a state school not far from Annenberg and moved in with my boyfriend - at least we were together every day now!
The move-in together was underwhelming though. While we had been a coupe for 10+ years and had holidayed together a fair bit, this is the first time we were living together - and it was not easy. 

My boyfriend turned out to be a person that was somewhat disorganized, definitely lazy, carefree and quite dependent. While I think of myself as a responsible and hard working person, taking care of another person and an entire household was something new and awkward for me.

It also occurred to me that my boyfriend might have had some fun on the side during our long distance phase (I have been faithful)

Still, he finally proposed, I accepted and soon after we were married and I got absorbed in the engagement-marriage-honeymoon bliss hoping that things would settle down and we would iron out our issues.

Post our honeymoon, I took up an internship at a boutique consulting firm. Graduate school was definitely helping me grow as a person and a professional, the internship really opened my eyes  - about my career, my work options, the many many possibilities that were there for me to tap, along with a totally new network of people from my grad class and my internship. I was on a roll in school and at work and enjoying and appreciating all the newness - the skills, new work and new colleagues and classmates.

It was at the internship that I met this consultant [ 36 M] that I became friends with. He is a thorough professional, excellent communicator, highly skilled and is held in high esteem. He is well-mannered, respectful, helpful and sincere. 

I could not but help contrast the men in my consulting firm with my husband in terms of dedication, hard work, sincerity, maturity etc (same age group) and this particular person clearly stood out.

While we became friends, he never hit on me nor showed any inclination to romance me, which I respect.

Then, one day, at a group meeting at work, while my friend made an excellent presentation to a group of 20 odd people that included me, I orgasmed while seated in my chair, watching his presentation. It was unintentional and uncontrollable.

While we had become friends at work, that is what we were - friends at work and I never expected that he would excite me in this way. It certainly wasn't physical attraction - he is overweight by atleast 15 pounds, is just my height, is not muscular and is not handsome to look at. On the other hand, he's really sharp, he's witty, he's organized, disciplined and meticulous and logical. That's what blew me away, I guess.

Subsequently, over many interactions later on, I found that I was still attracted to him - every time we met, I felt an unmistakable spark and often my knees would go weak. 

While he was unaware of the effect he had on me, he was very much the 'work friend' that he has been from the beginning  - someone I can trust, I can discuss things with, seek advice and help from etc 

This went on for a few months until my husband and I graduated from school, I finished my internship (and my interaction reduced with my work friend) and we started new jobs.

This is where it gets repetitive. I found a job in LA, while my husband could find work only in another city far far way and not in LA. 

This time I did not want to leave my job and follow him again.

So we fell into a long distance relationship again, only this time we are married and we meet roughly once in two months at family events and festivals. Otherwise, there's Skype. A part of me wonders if my husband prefers a long distance relationship...

After about 6 months of this, we finally agreed that we would both move to San Jose, find jobs there and build our life together. My husband's company has an office in San Jose and can transfer him. It took me a few months, but I was able to find a job in San Jose and I have moved to San Jose and am now waiting for my husband to join me. 

I have been waiting for over 4 months now. I have met my husband twice at family festivities in our local town but he's not yet found a way to get a transfer to San Jose. Nor does he want to leave his job and join me in San Jose and look for a new job there.

I am 32 years old and I would now like to build a career and start a family. For that, I need my husband to be present and available, so that we can both have careers and can look after the children that we plan to have.

Which brings me to my friend at work. We have kept in touch. We exchange news and greetings. 
When I was in LA I would run into him at some common events or celebrations and I would go weak every time I saw him. 

He has asked me out for casually catching up over a work day lunch every now and then, but I can't bring myself to see him and I usually find a reason to say no.

Now I am no longer in LA, so we keep in touch - a sentence or two every now and then on social media as most friends so. While he is always happy to interact with me, he is a little puzzled, I am sure, by my unwillingness to see him.

Which brings me to where I am today - should I continue a long distance marriage? 

Should I simply settle for what I have and take whatever my husband is willing to put into this marriage?

Or, should I leave my husband, and venture out my own and try to find a new life partner who is more compatible with my personality traits and my goals?

I am might even venture with my friend who brought me to orgasm; on the other hand, I may find someone like that friend.

Unsure, Somewhat terrified and Anxious.
   
TL;DR:
Woman in long distance marriage evaluating options - take what I have, divorce, start afresh? This has been posted under 'infidelity' - so kindly don't judge and moralize. I don't need that.
Please try to guide. "
3p7q50,1,2015-10-18,My life has fallen apart post-graduation.,Zooghole,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/3p7q50/my_life_has_fallen_apart_postgraduation/,"I graduated about 1.5 years ago  from undergrad from a school in NYC, such a fast and fun place I loved so much. I felt like I grew up a lot and made some unmistakable bonds with peers and had my own apartment and learned to be self-sufficient. I graduated with my degree in film production and I was fairly confident in my skills and networking to get my foot in the door. 

Well, that came collapsing down. 3 months after school when it was time to renew my lease and get our rent jacked up, I figured I'd move back upstate to spare my roommate having to back out later. So, I moved back in with my parents in the suburbs ~3 hours away upstate for the first time in a few years. My parents have always been awesome and supportive and they don't charge me rent.

I've done NOTHING since moving back home. I always laughed at those people who move into their mom's basements and did nothing with their lives. You'd think living in the abrasive NYC environment would worsen my anxiety, but none of that happened until I got back to my hometown.

I have no job. Obviously there's not much in my field. I had a two-week-long film internship at one point last year and I barely said a peep the whole 2 weeks, I was so terrified of fucking up, the folks in charge must have thought I was a freak and lost my number as soon as left. I've applied to every retail job in the area, and I even got some offers for interviews and I've always talked myself out of going and found myself too scared to pick up the phone and schedule the interview.

I broke up with the person I was dating before I moved because I was feeling suffocated and like I wanted to be alone and the burden of maintaining a relationship was too much to bear. Just this week, I've been texting someone to arrange a date and I just keep being indecisive and wishy-washy even though I really want to do it. All of my friends from college are gone. I guess I ignored one too many of their texts and invitations to maintain that and soured all the bonds that meant a lot to me, but I was too afraid to reach out or try to maintain them without fear of failure or rejection.

My bank account wasn't very full from beginning, but now it's empty and my parents have started making my loan payments so I don't default on my unbearable student loans. I'm wracked with guilt over that, but it all feels so unwieldy because as soon as I get a job, I'll have to pay back my parents AND my monthly loans. And I feel guilty about even thinking that because I know I'll never default on my loans or go hungry and some people do. 

I pretty much lay in bed all day long. I'm fortunate enough to have been in therapy for the past few years, but I'm growing to resent my therapist when our sessions don't go the way I want and my psychological problems grow worse and I cry out for help unanswered. Maintaining good hygiene feels like a burden and takes tremendous effort, which is so embarrassing. I scheduled an appt with a psychopharmacologist to try to get on anti-anxiety medication, but there was some sort of clerical mixup and I found out they don't take my insurance. That was embarrassing. I waited 3 weeks for that appt and now I scheduled another one somewhere else and have to wait another 3 weeks, wasted time while my situation worsens and I fall even deeper into depression and debt. 

My mom probably thinks I'm suicidal, which I'm not, but she's always peeking her head into my bedroom to check up on me like I'm a lunatic you have to handle with kid gloves or some terminal cancer patient you treat gingerly. 

At my most pathetic, I will go on Facebook, message somebody ""Hi! Just wanted you to know I didn't forget about you! :)"" and they'll respond ""Hey, thanks! How's it going, what've you been up to?"" and I can't even respond, I'll just ignore them because I don't know how to answer. I want to scream the truth to the world, but listening to some weirdo who doesn't even have it that bad moan and groan about his problems makes people do nothing more than want to swat the annoying housefly and give the stock encouraging responses I've heard countless times. 

There's nothing really for anyone to say besides ""Oh, that's too bad, I hope you feel better"" or alternatively ""QUIT FEELING SORRY FOR YOURSELF AND SELF-PITYING AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT."" and neither of those do much for me at all.

I'm currently 23 and living in Bucharest, Romania. I'm working as a junior IT recruiter for a medium sized business IT and consulting company. I would place my English on an 8 out of 10.

I will not go into detail and try to be as clear as possible.
I'm facing a period where I got nothing to lose if I get away for some time (family/friends/etc are at the moment NOT reasons not to leave). So i'm looking to get away for a while and create an experience which will help me develop for the future.

How could and where should I look for a minimum wage internship or some basic work that will keep me away for 4 months at least?
I have graduated Journalism from my university and currently studying communications &amp; pr. My main domain of activity is Recruiting for IT companies.

Anyone willing to give a hand and some tips where could I look for some openings? 


Have a great weekend,

3p8y0k,6,2015-10-18,Questions on how to begin my career out of school,invullock,ChemicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/comments/3p8y0k/questions_on_how_to_begin_my_career_out_of_school/,"I'll start with a little bit about me.

I'm currently a third year at a top 10 engineering school, with a 3.55 overall GPA and a 3.0 in ChemE. 

I started at school as a Varsity athlete in Swimming, but decided after two years that I wanted more focus on school, so that I could graduate a year early (Summer 2016). During my time on the team, I was twice elected to the team Leadership Council.

I have been doing research with a fairly renowned professor for the past 3 semesters, working on a relatively solo project for the past two semesters.

After speaking with the graduate students in the lab, I've decided a PhD program isn't for me, and I want to begin a job ASAP after graduation.

As for my questions:

1. Does only having two years of varsity swimming look bad on a resume?

2. Do I have enough extracurriculars, or are they sparse? If they seem sparse, what can I add in the next 9 months or so that can really help?

3. Is my graduation time awkward for companies to hire me? Would I have to wait until the Fall 2016 graduation group to come through before I actually can get a job?

4. Should I pursue an internship first, and then a full-time job, even though I will have a degree?


Thank you for any and all help."
3p9281,4,2015-10-18,20M4A - This Cold War's about to get hot! [Russian] [I guess],GRDerek,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3p9281/20m4a_this_cold_wars_about_to_get_hot_russian_i/,"I had started the day with the best of intentions. 

But I had been sidetracked. Oh so utterly sidetracked. 

The road to hell was paved with good intentions, as the world around me was showing. That particular stock phrase was a bit too melodramatic for my circumstances. I’ve always been quite down-to-earth, as I hope you will soon agree. In my case, the road to an-outcome-that-means-I-ending-up-wasting-the-time-afforded-to-me-in-what-could-be-my-last-day-of-life is paved with good intentions.

Hmm. “Hell” is more succinct. 

Allow me to introduce myself. 

I’m a pretty nerdy bureaucrat at the State Department. Quite young. Got a background in academia. I’m one of those guys who either skips meritocracy or embodies it, depending on who you ask. I’ve been accused of both. Strange how a concept we think of as so concrete is so open to interpretation, its objectivity so dependant on position. 

But I digress. I’m a policy wonk. I’m one of those pasty wiry geeks who writes a decent PhD thesis, gets a couple of good internships and make connections with some Senator or two, and then goes straight from some prestigious university department, laden with equally prestigious levels of student debt, to some overpaid-yet-still-insufficiently-paid job doing paper-pushing for some Under Secretary. 

The Under Secretary for Political Affairs, to be exact. 

Yes, it’s a delightfully vague remit, and I love it. 

If I haven’t already mentioned it, I’m a policy wonk. I like to think of myself as an enthusiastic contributor to debates on issues from food aid legislation to the GATT, from Middle Eastern power politics to anti-colonial protests in Africa. A jack of all trades, master of all related to fopo, if I may allow myself a brief boast. And I do not hide this enthusiasm. I carry esoteric sociopolitical journals, loosely organised bundles of wonkish policy proposals that I strive to thrust under the nose of any passing power player, and heavily annotated philosophical tomes with me to work, every day. I go above and beyond the call of duty when it comes to policy ideas, bold new initiatives, meticulously researched regulatory reforms. My ideas are either politically implausible or ideological anathema. I have effectively no power, no successes under my belt beyond slightly reducing printing costs in one corridor of the Department. 

But hey, it’s experience. 

And I enjoy it. It’s fun. So fucking fun. 

And as I arrived to work, one mid-October morn, I expected it to be the same as usual. I had some new policy proposals - that I hope I could see implemented using the famous “slip into somebody’s inbox” trick - about Caribbean development that I was very enthusiastic to present. I had even gotten them peer reviewed, in a sense, over a glass of beer or twelve. 

Alas, the day would live on in history, and not as the day that I cemented my position as a great ideological architect of a new era of compassionate capitalism, but as the day the Cuban Missile Crisis really got going. I was quickly told, in no uncertain terms, that I should either shut up about my policy proposals or manually use them to construct myself a structurally superfluous new behind, and the former option seemed preferable. My bosses - well, delegates of my bosses, people I had never seen before but had no choice but to trust because of their official badges and the fact that they could have snapped me into two if they wanted - had me running around. 

Relaying vital communications. Delivering crucial emergency contingency plans. Facilitating communication between the US and third parties. Ensuring a coherent cross-government strategy developed.

If I was writing memoirs, that’s how I’d describe my activities that day. In reality, I was enabling different branches of the government to deliver various synonyms for “we’re fucked if this kicks off” to one another. 

That was my responsibility for most of the day. 

Eventually, my duties for the day were made redundant. A more effective strategy for panicking was developed, I assume. But I was not allowed to go home and prepare for the potential apocalypse. No. One of the other managers insisted I do busywork, to maintain an illusion that the State Department was actually having a credible role in fixing this mess. I assume forcing underlings to carry out busywork was his own form of busywork. 

So, here I am. Sitting in a room. Alone. Ticking boxes, looking at an inconsequential phone that connects to some minor Red Army base in Siberia or some shit. I don’t know. 

Might as well pass the time.

----

Not exactly sticking to the theme with the utmost fidelity, but an idea for a Cuban missile crisis prompt jumped out at me, and I couldn't say no. Long story short, there's two ways this can go. Either you can be a fellow State Department official, either a senior position needing stress relief or a fellow drone seeking to pass the time, or a Russian counterpart on the other end of the line, someone else completely shut off from any actual meaningful information. I'll be playing as the arrogant nerdy virgin bureaucrat whose voice you heard from above. 

Don't worry, he's not *too* much like me in real life.  

Turn-ons: dirty talk, public masturbation, ""fuck it we might be dead in a few hours"" sex, heated philosophical debates about the merits of our respective socioeconomic systems and various wonky policy ideas, being dominated (especially by a Russian), banging shoes on tables, power dynamics and/or technically being enemies, busywork, the Red Scare, detente, Soviet-America hotlines, destroying perfectly good idioms

Turn-offs: thawing in geopolitical relations, non-con and extreme stuff, proxy wars in Asia"

--Enjoy
——

It was a cool May night, I was at a popular nightclub in Brooklyn celebrating a friend’s birthday. After acquainting myself with the venue and having a few drinks I decided to take a couple rounds to scope out the talent for the evening.


About midway through the night, I check out the outside area to see what was going on in the smoking section. I don’t really smoke, but it happens to be a low risk way to start talking to strike up a conversation with a girl you fancy.


I set my sights on Maria. She was blonde with a thin, 5’6 frame draped in a short black shorts, a blank tank top and thin black sweater. We got to talking and I learned she was from Paris in NYC for an internship. As our conversation continued, her friends leave her with me and go back inside.


I invite her in to dance with me, which she obliges however she keeps a fair distance as opposed to the grinding that I would have preferred to do. I think that she is not too interested in me. The night ends with a kiss on the cheek and her phone number.


My friend works in nightlife and scored me 2 free tickets for a show at another popular night club.I text her inviting her out. It’s a Friday night which isn’t a common night to meet a random dude, but surprisingly, she agrees.


I meet her for some wine before we head over to the club. She’s in a tight white dress that really accentuates her beautiful tight body. We get to know each other a bit before we head over to the club. I find her french accent and sensibility incredibly attractive.


We walk into the VIP line and she is greeted warmly by my gaggle of friends. While waiting in line, we find a private moment of eye contact in the crowd and share a kiss. I’m in. I have successfully convinced her that I am worthy of her affection.


Once we get inside, I see a different Maria than I did the week earlier. She is buying me drinks, extremely touchy, kissing me, grinding with me. After a night of drinking and dancing, I tell her it’s time to go home.


— GOOD STUFF STARTS HERE —


We jump into one of those new cabs where the driver can’t really see the people in the back. We’re making out fairly heavily, I grip her waist tightly and position her hand near my crotch.


She gets the hint and moves her hand to my member and begins petting it. My cock hardness. Feeling a bit drunk and adventurous I unzip my jeans an free my pants and take my cock out. She begins to stroke it. I give her a nod, suggesting that she should go down on me. She hesitated at first, but quickly decided to oblige. It was an enjoyable cab ride home.


Once we reached my apartment, I gave her the tour with the last stop being my bedroom Clothes come off quite quickly. This is the first time I get to admire her body. She has B cup tits, areola slightly larger for for her breast size but none of the less beautiful.


I get up from my bed to turn off the Iights and strip down to my boxer briefs. By this time, my penis is sporting a semi- erection. I turn on a side lamp to create some dim lighting and approach her. I take out my cock and motion for her to rise and meet my cock with her mouth.


As she approaches my dick, she sticks out her tongue, it is only then I realize that she has her tongue pierced. I am about to experience a blow job I have fantasized about for some time.


As she sucks my dick, I consciously focus on the effect of her piercing on the head of my cock. I tell her to look me in the eye as she sucks me off. During this time, I slip off her pink panties, and begin fingering her slowly. Once the lubrication of her wetness increases I begin to search for her G spot and finger her furiously. She can barely contain her self increasing the speed and intensity of her head bob as her feelings of pleasure increase. She experiences her first orgasm of the night.


 She begins to nibble on my foreskin and my cock is now hard as a rock. It is then she utters one of my favorite phrases to hear, “Do you have a condom?”


As i roll a magnum condom down my shaft, I watch Maria play with her self. I began to shift towards her. I push her off her propped elbows so that she is lying flat on her back. I grab my throbbing member and orient towards her dripping pussy.


I’m fairly girthy so there is always a bit of resistance from when I enter a girl for the first time. She exclaims as I make my way into her. Her pussy feels warm and tight around my cock. My rhythm begins slow but strong. She begins cooing like crazy, kicking her legs and scratching my back.


Our mouths meet, our tongues flowing freely, exploring each other mouths. From her kissing style, she was most certainly french.


We oscillate through various positions, missionary, modified missionary, cowgirl. One point, I whip off the condom and stick my dick back into her mouth and the angle my body on top of hers so I can lick and play with her clit.


I turn her on to her stomach, roll on another condom and begin fucking her from behind. This is one of my favorite positions because I can really give her my full length from this angle. She moans loudly as I fuck her mercilessly, she tells me she is about to come and I begin ramming her even harder. She comes loudly.


I pause to let her catch her breath for a minute and slowly start over again. She begins to talk dirty to me in her sexy french accent, she tells me how much she loves my cock and how she loves sucking on it, and how she loves when I fuck her.


I ask her if she is ready for my cum, and she begins to beg for it. I tell her that I am going to cum all over her ass. She nods furiously in anticipation. 


With that, I begin to pump her with an more intense pace. She is taking it as best she can, she takes my thumb in her mouth and sucks on it as hard as she can. I fuck her until I feel that feeling build in my loins, and I begin to fuck her even faster. 


As the moment approaches, I take off the condom and begin jerking off. I let our 4-5 spurts of cum that land on her ass and back.


I rub my hand into the small white puddles and give her a small massage. I spoon her as my penis returns to a flaccid state and she purrs quietly. 


We lay there in the low light, until we get up to go smoke a joint. Later that night we would make love again.

3p9nxo,1,2015-10-18,"I dont think I have psychological problems, it's just that all is lost",andshewoulddarken,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3p9nxo/i_dont_think_i_have_psychological_problems_its/,"I tried everything and nothing worked. Even those helplines. Maybe this will do.

I am 27 by now. I am jobless, I don't have a degree. I come from a poor country and live in a rich one and here I feel I am worth less than a worm as everyone is gorgeous, well dressed, tall, with a phd and has travelled to 80 countries.

I lost my long time girlfriend recently. Even though life wasn't exactly good it was like the only pillar holding my life and preventing me to fall down on what I used to be when I was a teenager. Any attempts to get another girlfriend or even a hook up or whatever failed, either from the start or after one day. I seem to be unbearable to everyone, actually, even making friends is hard. I feel like everyone looks down on me, for being too weird, too ugly, too normal, always too something.

Rejection is really the tone of my life. Everything i try to do, I get rejected. I tried joining a football team, I tried starting a band, everytime people either reject me straightaway or get tired of me quite fast. It's not even relationships anymore, I dropped out of something I was studying because I had nobody to talk to in the class and the teacher was passive agressive to me all the time.

I came through a point where I have nothing left in my life. All my dreams died. Cheesy, but it is. I had one left wish in my life: to be a great dad one day. This is now gone too. I think it's realistic to say I never will be in a relationship again. There is no way I could meet new people in my life, and every desperate measure I take to do this only ends in more frustration and rejection.

I am really living for nothing. I have no plans, no will, everything I do I do it counting the minutes for it to end. I am researching suicide methods and thinking about it seriously for weeks by now, but I only don't do it because I am a fucking coward. I get scared that it might hurt, that it won't kill me, or something. I do love life. I am that kind of person who gets its day changed by a baby smile or a singing bird. Not even this happens anymore. I don't even hate myself. I honestly don't even think I am ugly, but all the world does. When I was a ugly, whiny charmless 15 year old and only thought about dying all the time I knew there were plently of things I could do with my life. Now I really think I am doing the best I can and this is still not enough.

I am becoming an horrible person. Bitter, annoying, jealous. There is really no way now I can impress somebody or charm somebody. I hate to be jealous. But I cant help, my life is that South Park episode where Cartman gets an amusement park on his name and Kyle hemorroids on loop. At the same time I get no answers after applying for a temporary job in a warehouse at christmas, people around me get internships at UN and things like this (yes, I am not exaggerating).

I have no will, no hope and honestly think everything is over. I am too old. I didn't enjoy life when I could. It's too late now, and I am sick of people telling OHHH BUT YOU ARE SO YOUNG.

I want to live, I want to get to fall asleep, I want to stop feeling sorry about myself. And I honestly don't think I have depression. I don't think I have a distorted view of what life is. Which is worse. I can't do anything that takes time because time is not on my side. Soon I will be 28,29,30, and my life will be even more over than it is now.

I tried the helplines here but they just tell me to get professional help, as if I could get it right now instead of having to wait 6 months for a psychologist. I am not even hoping to get any useful help from this. I just need to let it out, as none of my friends can take me anymore."
3p9wxr,0,2015-10-18,Do you find these traits date worthy?,throwaway584118,dating,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/3p9wxr/do_you_find_these_traits_date_worthy/,"Okay, so here's a little background. I would say I'm sub-par appearance wise.
I'm essentially a nerd, or geek or whatever you want to call it. I spend quite a bit of time playing some games. Now I am very passionate about computer Science, which I study at university. I invest a lot of my time helping others on a few tech support sites involving Kernel debugging as that is my main passion in CompSci. I would love to work for Microsoft as an intern, and subsequently a graduate in escalation tech support with low level Windows debugging. Anyway, that's another story.
I have varies other hobbies, including WW2 History, to some degree politics, film/TV, snooker &amp; pool. Lots of others, but I've forgot at the moment. I would like to learn to play the Piano, or the Violin. But it's a very time consuming, and costly hobby.
My personality however, is one that people either like, or dislike. I am very opinionated, largely due to my upbringing. I usually try and state my mind, probably far too much. That being said, I don't consider myself to be arrogant. Why? Well I know that I'm not better than everyone else. I like to be right, but when I am wrong, I will blatantly admit it, because no single person is all knowing. You never stop learning, and that is the beauty of life. Or curse, depending on your point of view.
I've never had a girlfriend, or made many relations with women, as a matter of fact. I'm not shy very much, as you could probably have guessed.

This is a long post, but I believe that this idea has the potential to help Bernie's campaign overcome a lot of the major issues it is facing at the moment. If you want to get to the meat of it, start reading at the *** below. First, I want to convince you that it is worth your time to read this proposal:

1. It's my birthday and my cake day (as I made a reddit account just for this post)

2. 9 years ago, when I was in 10th grade, I sent Bernie a handwritten letter telling him how much I loved what he was doing and I asked him to let me help him in any way I was able as a summer intern. It has been a surreal experience watching his support grow on the campaign trail after being such a big fan of his work for so long.

3. I majored in Economics with the hope of being able to help promote Bernie's economic views. I worked for Reagan's economic advisor (yep, that guy who invented the Laffer Curve, the theory that the Republicans still rely on to justify lowering taxes for the rich. Essentially, he is the arch nemesis of all that Bernie fights for) for a summer with the hope of trying to find middle ground or reason in the madness of Republican economic injustice. I didn't find what I was looking for and came to the conclusion that the political economic standoff would not be helped by economic arguments alone and the majority of Republican voters would continue to vote against their financial interest as long as voting republican is seen as a Christian responsibility. So I decided to get a masters in literature in theology, as a non-religious guy, in an effort to learn about Christianity and produce an effective argument against the all-too-prevalent association between Republican ideology and the Christian faith. I am still working on my thesis (which is my attempt to prove the silliness of the Christian/republican association), but I have put it off until next semester so I can spend most of my time researching and writing to produce something that will help Bernie's campaign. This is the first idea that has been thought out completely and I hope you find value in its potential:


The weak points of Bernie's campaign that this proposal hopes to strengthen: 

1. Low polling numbers among certain demographics 

2. Only his avid supporters know a lot about his positions and the average American does not care enough to cause him/her to learn more without an additional incentive

3. Popular media does not offer a fair representation of his views, so it is unlikely that a non-Berner in a low-support demographic will achieve a comprehensive understanding of the impact that a Bernie presidency would have on America because the threshold of interest that is necessary to cause a person to do a sufficient amount of independent research on Bernie's proposals to convert the person is too damn high to be overcome by three second sound bites or internet memes.


***The hope of this proposal is to offer an incentive to the as-of-yet unBerned to learn about the potential impacts that Bernie's policies would have on their day-to-day lives (with regard to personal income, taxation, income inequality, poverty levels, etc.) from a source that offers quantitative figures (describing the our present socioeconomic conditions and the possibilities for the future) and is not skewed by the filter of the popular media. The idea is to start an online video ad campaign through Facebook. Four or five 2 to 3 minute videos will be made to illustrate the value that Bernie's proposals can offer to the lives of individuals and the aggregate wellbeing of America. Each time one of these videos is viewed from beginning to end, a dollar will be donated to a charity. There will be 4 or 5 charities to chose from. Each particular charity will be chosen with the intention of expanding Bernie's base and reaching out to low-polling demographics. If a person chooses to support, for example, United Negro College Fund, the 2-3 minute video that he will view in order to have a dollar donated to this fund would provide information that is focussed on the ways in which Bernie's policies would help social injustice, wealth inequality, residual race-based income inequality that persists from the time of slavery (until the mean income of blacks and whites becomes equal, slavery reparations cannot justifiably be claimed to be complete), easing the burden of debt on college students and parents of students, giving the opportunity to millions of students to be the first member of their family line to receive a college degree, welfare programs, etc. each of the videos, paired with a relevant charity, will be chosen with the intention of reaching out to unBerned demographics. The videos will be accessed through Facebook and a dollar will only be donated to an organization one time per Facebook user, while the user will be able to watch any of the videos at any time. There will be a cap on the amount of money that will be donated (the specific amount will be discussed below). This will offer a time incentive and a competitive aspect to the ad campaign. Supporters of a particular organization will be compelled to encourage friends to participate for the purpose of maximizing the amount of money that is donated to the organization they support. Ideally, a person's Facebook timeline would show that he/she participated in the ad campaign. Helping charities is always cool, and there is nothing cooler than being cool, so peer pressure and social conformity will be able to have a positive influence on something for once (any reason is a good reason to appreciate Bernie's Good News).
This method of advertising is superior to other, more traditional methods for a number of reasons:

1. 'The American people are tired of your damn' commercials. A person does not choose to watch a commercial. This is a matter of psychology. A person is more open to accepting an opinion if he/she chooses to be exposed to it (more so if he/she believes that he/she is doing something good, liking helping a charity, while he/she is hearing the message). Bernie's message will be associated with a movement that is helping a cause that the viewer is invested in helping.

2. Recently, the popular media has been highlighting the exorbitant volume of money that is being charged for ad space during the debates (money that goes to big media companies) and the incredible amount of money that candidates plan to spend on advertising this campaign season (I think I read that it is expected to come out to 4.6 billion dollars). It would certainly be seen in a positive light, and align with Bernie's message, if Bernie were to redirect the flow of adverting expenditures away from big corporations toward the people he set out to help.

3. This method of advertising would allow for information to be tailored to the interests of the advertisee to a degree that is not possible with traditional advertising.

4. Bernie's message cannot be described and justified in a thirty second commercial. 2-3 minutes of purposefully organized information, with the use of effective charts and graphs can have the potential to convert a voter. Bernie has felt it necessary to make it a priority to stick to a few key talking points, mostly observations of the horrible conditions we are faced with in recent interviews because these facts get people's attention. The real value of his campaign, however, is in his solutions. 2-3 minutes of audio and visual media will allow for a more effective and brief argument regarding the need for change (charts and graphs are much more effective than spouted numbers out of their context) and an opportunity to expand on the details of his proposals, their potential effects, and prove that they are, in fact, possible to implement (by providing real figures that show where money will be coming from to pay for certain policies and that there is enough money to successfully implement these policies).

5. A radical and favorable new method of advertising, such as this method, would force the popular media to give Bernie positive press. I believe, after doing a small amount of research on the matter, that 5-10 million dollars is a realistic estimate of the amount of money to be used for donations. If ten million Americans were to hear a comprehensive account of Bernie's message, I believe the polls would shift drastically in his favor. A charitable contribution of that size by a political campaign would be extraordinarily noteworthy. Also, I would not be surprised if the money spent on the ad campaign came back threefold in donations caused by the campaign, so it would be an investment, not a net expense.

6. This would provide an effective avenue to reach demographics that are not currently supporting Bernie because they do not know enough about his policies (Bernie is having trouble with minorities, women, and people age 40-60). I do not intend to make offensive generalizations in what follows, but targeting particular demographics is inherently offensive in this regard, so forgive me if I offend you, I genuinely am opposed to any form of social inequality or discrimination. Bernie is an old white man. If I were a black American in today's society (I'm not claiming that I am able to relate accurately to the hardships of race discrimination or subjugation, I am only attempting, to the best of my ability, to sympathize) I would not believe that an old white man would be able to improve my situation any more than Obama has done. I would be distrustful of the political process that has accepted the disparity between the mean income of blacks and whites as the status quo despite the history of racist oppression that caused it. I would not have the incentive to learn about Bernie's proposals and how they could help to correct this injustice that is so deeply entrenched in our society. I would, however, be interested in giving aid to organizations that focus on reducing the injustice and suffering that faces today's black Americans, especially if it does not cost me a cent. I firmly believe that the low polling numbers among black voters would rise substantially if the potential effects of his policies were made known to more black Americans. The 40-60 age group, according to my highly subjective and potentially offensive assessment, are attracted to internet fads. They want to be in the know about the goings on of popular culture. They want to be a part of 'it'. Judging by the posts made by this demographic on my newsfeed, there is a low bar set for the qualification of 'worth watching or posting' and I believe this ad campaign would overwhelmingly exceed this threshold. If these videos are able to convince lower to middle class viewers of the financial and social benefits that they would directly experience if Bernie were president, I believe there would be a major shift in the polls. Finally, I don't think we should exclude the possibility of converting republicans in this effort. It is a fact that the majority of Republican voters would experience more social and financial benefits under Bernie than under any of the Republican candidates. If this campaign were to include a charity that is favorable to Republicans (while not being unfavorable to Democrats) such as a charity that supports gun safety or a Christian charity, I think it could be successful in convincing Republican viewers that Bernie's message is not based in the ridiculous and fabricated opposition between Democrats and Republicans, but is in fact rooted in the opposition between justice and injustice. A vote for Bernie is not a vote for 'socialism', it is a vote for a set of prioritized initiatives that benefit the great majority of American aimed toward revitalizing the American Dream by reducing economic inequality and financial corruption.

3padyj,3,2015-10-18,Going back to school to qualify for internships?,Chemethrowaway1,ChemicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/comments/3padyj/going_back_to_school_to_qualify_for_internships/,"I’m a recent graduate (gpa of 3.30/4.0) and find myself in a similar situation as some of you, and that is: no internship experience and unable to find a job.  A little background about myself, I owned a cabinet shop during the early 2000s but closed it in 2009 after the housing market crashed. I went back to school and decided a degree in chemical engineering would be a good idea. As you can probably guess, I’m a bit older than your average student. I’m 37 and have a family. Anyway, due to my personal situation, I never even applied for an internship while attending school. Now that I’ve graduated, I find myself in a situation where I can’t get a job because I have no internship experience, but can no longer get an internship because I’m no longer a student. I’ve applied to a number of internships and spoken to recruiters at job fairs and the general consensus is that they won’t consider new grads for internships. 

So…One idea that I’m looking into is going back to school for a similar degree like mechanical or environmental engineering. Then I would again be a student and qualify for internships. The thing is, I would have no intention of actually going all the way and earning a second degree. My plan is to only attend this spring in order to qualify for a summer internship. My dilemma is, I wonder how ethical this plan is. And I may have a little trouble explaining to potential employers why I’m going back for a second degree (but I’m sure I’ll think of something). Some advice on my plan would be welcomed. If you were an employer, what would you think of someone going back for a second engineering degree?

Cersei Lannister: I'd love to play a guard that she takes a liking to and is actually able to 'make' her do things that she wouldn't normally. She likes his assertiveness and the fact that he is unafraid to tell the queen to bend over like a common whore, or get on her knees and swallow no matter how little she cares to do so.

Daenerys: For her, I'd love to play someone that can take her away from her 'Queenly' state and make her feel like a dirty young girl again. Whether that's one of her closest bodyguards, a trusted adviser, or a soldier for her army..... or maybe she gives her body up as a prize to a much needed ally perhaps?

Shae: After all that she did? I just want to treat her like a whore at the whorehouse.... Is that so much to ask?

Others: Arya Stark, Catelyn Stark, Margaery Tyrell

---House of Lies---

Jeannie: Obvious one here, but I'd play almost anyone against her in some fashion. A new boyfriend that is truly her baby daddy... A past fling coming back in to her life and wooing her .... A booty call on a business trip that turns in to something slightly more serious.... Etc etc!

Monica: She needs a nice young stud to keep her busy, doesn't she? I'm thinking an intern that she tries to belittle and finally wants to ease a bit of tension and then realizes just how big of a boy he is ... and it draws her to him more and more even if they really don't get along on a personal level.

Others: April, Sarah Guggenheim, Marisa McClintock, Brynn

Pam Beesley: Something without Jim would be fantastic. Whether she's desperate at her apartment after breaking up with Roy that she'll give herself up to the landlord for more time/lesser rent... Maybe she's lonely and lets a warehouse guy take her for a ride that she can't help but want to relive on a nearly daily basis? Or an intern that she catches taking a liking to her and who knows where they go from there!

Jan: Another cougar that needs a young man. She's shown many times over that she loves interns and younger men in general!

Erin: Someone very dominate for her since she seems to be unsure/innocent... and she needs somebody that can break her of that streak.

Kelly: I have a feeling that she'd use just about anyone to make Ryan jealous. Let's give her a new person to do just that with. We can figure out if he's a perfect fit for her or just a guy with a dick that can shut her up for a few minutes at a time while they do some dirty things with one another!

Others: Angela, Meredith, Holly Flax....

Feel free to toss almost anyone else at me too as I'm sure I've missed some! Looking for something potentially long-term but I'm more then happy with just doing one scene if you'd rather go that route!

3pc0lw,3,2015-10-19,First time living on-campus in college. How do I tell my roommate? How do I tell anyone?,kaeporan,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/3pc0lw/first_time_living_oncampus_in_college_how_do_i/,"Hi all,

I'm a transfer student at a large university. Lately things have been difficult. I went off Depakote and am currently on a whopping dose of absolutely nothing. My diagnosis was switched from type 2 to type 1. I'm balancing a very fast-paced 15 units, an internship, and now a new position on a student club. Things are not going so hot. At all. My moods are bungee jumping, I'm not sleeping very much, I go from elated to irritated to depressed within a couple of days, and today I spent over an hour curled up under my sheets so that my roommate couldn't see me because there's absolutely no way I can pretend to be ""normal"" right now. I don't feel like I'm functioning. 

I'm meeting with my therapist tomorrow but likely won't be able to see a psychiatrist for another week. I'm paranoid and living with other people is difficult right now. I don't feel safe talking to people, and I don't know how to tell them that I'm not always like this and that I'm having big problems. Only two people here know that I see a therapist and take (took?) medication, and one is my roommate, who has been remarkably unsupportive and dismissive about the whole thing. 

I don't feel confident telling people that I'm bipolar. I don't want to ""come out"" about it, or make a big deal of it, but I want to explain my behavior. I really want support because it's really rough being away from home and dealing with paranoia and withdrawal effects all while also managing my disorder. Sometimes I wonder if I'm even cut out for college, even though I worked my ass off to get here. I just want to know this is going to be okay, because at this point I actually miss being on Zyprexa.

Does anyone have any advice or support? Thank you. "
3pc5by,3,2015-10-19,20M4A - This Cold War's about to get hot! [Russian] [I guess],GRDerek,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3pc5by/20m4a_this_cold_wars_about_to_get_hot_russian_i/,"I had started the day with the best of intentions. 

But I had been sidetracked. Oh so utterly sidetracked. 

The road to hell was paved with good intentions, as the world around me was showing. That particular stock phrase was a bit too melodramatic for my circumstances. I’ve always been quite down-to-earth, as I hope you will soon agree. In my case, the road to an-outcome-that-means-I-ended-up-wasting-the-time-afforded-to-me-in-what-could-be-my-last-day-of-life is paved with good intentions.

Hmm. “Hell” is more succinct. 

Allow me to introduce myself. 

I’m a pretty nerdy bureaucrat at the State Department. Quite young. Got a background in academia. I’m one of those guys who either skips meritocracy or embodies it, depending on who you ask. I’ve been accused of both. Strange how a concept we think of as so concrete is so open to interpretation, its objectivity so dependant on position. 

But I digress. I’m a policy wonk. I’m one of those pasty wiry geeks who writes a decent PhD thesis, gets a couple of good internships and make connections with some Senator or two, and then goes straight from some prestigious university department, laden with equally prestigious levels of student debt, to some overpaid-yet-still-insufficiently-paid job doing paper-pushing for some Under Secretary. 

The Under Secretary for Political Affairs, to be exact. 

Yes, it’s a delightfully vague remit, and I love it. 

If I haven’t already mentioned it, I’m a policy wonk. I like to think of myself as an enthusiastic contributor to debates on issues from food aid legislation to the GATT, from Middle Eastern power politics to anti-colonial protests in Africa. A jack of all trades, master of all related to fopo, if I may allow myself a brief boast. And I do not hide this enthusiasm. I carry esoteric sociopolitical journals, loosely organised bundles of wonkish policy proposals that I strive to thrust under the nose of any passing power player, and heavily annotated philosophical tomes with me to work, every day. I go above and beyond the call of duty when it comes to policy ideas, bold new initiatives, meticulously researched regulatory reforms. My ideas are either politically implausible or ideological anathema. I have effectively no power, no successes under my belt beyond slightly reducing printing costs in one corridor of the Department. 

But hey, it’s experience. 

And I enjoy it. It’s fun. So fucking fun. 

And as I arrived to work, one mid-October morn, I expected it to be the same as usual. I had some new policy proposals - that I hope I could see implemented using the famous “slip into somebody’s inbox” trick - about Caribbean development that I was very enthusiastic to present. I had even gotten them peer reviewed, in a sense, over a glass of beer or twelve. 

Alas, the day would live on in history, and not as the day that I cemented my position as a great ideological architect of a new era of compassionate capitalism, but as the day the Cuban Missile Crisis really got going. I was quickly told, in no uncertain terms, that I should either shut up about my policy proposals or manually use them to construct myself a structurally superfluous new behind, and the former option seemed preferable. My bosses - well, delegates of my bosses, people I had never seen before but had no choice but to trust because of their official badges and the fact that they could have snapped me into two if they wanted - had me running around. 

Relaying vital communications. Delivering crucial emergency contingency plans. Facilitating communication between the US and third parties. Ensuring a coherent cross-government strategy developed.

If I was writing memoirs, that’s how I’d describe my activities that day. In reality, I was enabling different branches of the government to deliver various synonyms for “we’re fucked if this kicks off” to one another. 

That was my responsibility for most of the day. 

Eventually, my duties for the day were made redundant. A more effective strategy for panicking was developed, I assume. But I was not allowed to go home and prepare for the potential apocalypse. No. One of the other managers insisted I do busywork, to maintain an illusion that the State Department was actually having a credible role in fixing this mess. I assume forcing underlings to carry out busywork was his own form of busywork. 

So, here I am. Sitting in a room. Alone. Ticking boxes, looking at an inconsequential phone that connects to some minor Red Army base in Siberia or some shit. I don’t know. 

Might as well pass the time.

----

Reposting this - am still looking for a partner!

Not exactly sticking to the theme with the utmost fidelity, but an idea for a Cuban missile crisis prompt jumped out at me, and I couldn't say no. Long story short, there's two ways this can go. Either you can be a fellow State Department official, either a senior position needing stress relief or a fellow drone seeking to pass the time, or a Russian counterpart on the other end of the line, someone else completely shut off from any actual meaningful information. I'll be playing as the arrogant nerdy virgin bureaucrat whose voice you heard from above. 

Don't worry, he's not *too* much like me in real life.  

Turn-ons: dirty talk, public masturbation, ""fuck it we might be dead in a few hours"" sex, heated philosophical debates about the merits of our respective socioeconomic systems and various wonky policy ideas, being dominated (especially by a Russian), banging shoes on tables, power dynamics and/or technically being enemies, busywork, the Red Scare, detente, Soviet-America hotlines, destroying perfectly good idioms

Turn-offs: thawing in geopolitical relations, non-con and extreme stuff, proxy wars in Asia"
3pdkf3,11,2015-10-19,[20F4M] Loyal and affectionate sub seeking caring yet strict Dom for stability and care,plants_op,BDSMpersonals,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/3pdkf3/20f4m_loyal_and_affectionate_sub_seeking_caring/,"Hello!

I recently left a Dom who wasn't really satisfying my needs anymore and, since I found him here, decided I'd try again. Please bear with me as this is a bit of a lengthy post, but I would rather explain everything once than a billion times to people who may not be interested in what I have to offer or who may not like what I am asking for.

I'm a 20 y/o Asian-American college student with a lot of responsibilities and very little time for any of them. I manage and plan a lot of projects for my non-profit orgs on top of rigorous coursework and a part time internship. I love what I do but I often find the whole being-in-charge ordeal to be immensely exhausting. My favorite form of stress relief lately has been through sex, and through submission.

I find great joy in having a sir to tell me what I should do to please him, as it relieves the responsibility from me. Being able to let someone else make decisions for me, and to control aspects of my life for me, is greatly satisfying, though I rarely find men who I am comfortable relinquishing that control to. Though I don't have a lot of free time, I am always eager to perform a task if I know that it will please my sir.

I'm looking for a gentle caregiver yet strict sir. I would like someone who has time to care for and support me, can carry conversations with me, and can command my respect without the use of force (because if you could control me with just words, controlling me with force would just be that much more exhilarating).

Since I'm very busy, my sir should be understanding of my busy schedule should something prevent me from doing as he asks but also firm in punishing me for not doing what he asked. Similarly, if I do something well, I expect to be rewarded.

I also expect to know where I stand with my Dom. If he is upset with me, or pleased with me, or busy and unable to attend to me, I expect those things to be communicated with me. I will do the same to him.

Ideally, my sir would be in the Los Angeles area, but I am open to online as well. I would prefer someone who is fit, but a few pounds extra here or there isn't to big of a deal, and I would prefer someone who is not older than 28.

As for kinks, I am into bondage, spanking, punishments, light breath play, and I also like performing tasks. I also love rough sex. Public play has been a fantasy that I've always wanted to enact but have never had the courage to do. I am also very fond of giving blowjobs. I also am very affectionate and love aftercare and just doting attention in general.

I have had a couple of online Doms who were fun but did not offer me the support and care I was looking for. I only have had one in-person Dom, and he was the one I recently left. I am still a little inexperienced in in-person play, but am eager and willing to learn.

I will be very clear that I do not submit to just anyone. I have very high standards for myself and I will have high standards for my sir as well. Before I submit, I must be able to acknowledge you as at least my equal, if not my superior. I also demand not only respect for my person and my boundaries but also patience with my busy schedule and mental state.

I am aware that I am very picky, but I can promise you that if I choose to submit to you, you will find me a very loyal and caring sub who is eager to please and eager to learn.

If any of this interests you, please feel free to message me. I promise I can be fun :-)"

-----  

    From The Desk Of Alice Heltzer
    Tank Commander, Jr Grade, REGAL-F.
    First Woman’s Tankery Division
    Dated: August 16th, 1952.
    Subject: Mission at Stalingrad Ruins.
    Report Begins:
This was always the hardest part, sadly. The actual *writing* of the report. Though her 18th birthday had come and gone, celebrated in the cold dimness of the Siberian Winter with her girls in their revamped Jagdpanther 38(t), she still felt like a frightened child, perpetually on the cusp of disappointing her parents. 

But her parents were dead. That was something she had in common with most of the girls of the Woman’s 1st. Being younger than 25, and being an orphan. She was now 18, a fact that made her a little proud. She had never expected to make it this far, with the Liberty Army marching well into Poland, and with Forward Manufactorums stretching all the way into New Europe itself. 

New Europe.

When she had been a child, her Father, the Colonel had called this the USSR. Soviet Russia. A cold, barren, inhospitable place, that the Third Reich would crush beneath the cold Iron of the Panzerkorps. The world would be unified under Swastika and Fuhrer, and that would be the end of it.  A perfect world for all Aryan and Loyal bloodlines. A perfect place for his Daughter to grow up. Such a future was now known to be impossible.

On December 7th, 1941, America invaded the Island Nation of Japan. With most of the Navy preparing for a sneak attack of the territory of Hawaii, there was nothing to stop the Airborne Infantry and the Shockmarines from taking the nation in less than 48 hours. What happened next shocked the world, and deeply influenced the Third Reich.

The USA was dissolved. Instead, they rechristened their nation The Liberty Empire.

And they killed every single citizen of Japan. Man, woman, and child. None were spared.

    On Friday, August 1st, 1952, the crew of Jagdpanther 38(t)
    “Porcelain Cannon” discovered that the Liberty Army 
    is constructing a Manufactorum on the ruins of Stalingrad.

Stalingrad, where the German Army and USSR had *both* been sneak-attacked by the Liberty Army. 3 *million* fatalities. The single most violent military engagement in human history. The turning point of the war. See, from the point the Liberty Empire was born, they were a loose cannon. The invasion and subsequent eradication of the Japanese people. Invading and “colonizing” the British Isles as *New Jamestown*. The Tesla Bomb on Normandy Beach.

The War, which had looked to be a drawn out, ugly engagement suddenly looked to be over much, *much* faster.

Those with military service were drafted on all sides, in order to hold back the Red, White, and Blue storm. Her Father was killed in Paris. Her mother, about 45 miles away from the German Border. She was enlisted in the Hitler Youth Girls Tank Division, and was teamed up with another orphan girl. Together, they got to work learning the intricacies of tank operations.

    At 0345 Local Time, Driver Anneliese Straub spotted a pair 
    of Liberty Type-3 Hovertanks, patrolling the outer reaches 
    of the ruined city. 
    Inside, lights were shining on a spire being constructed. I 
    gave the order for a scouting team to disembark the tank and 
    scout on foot.

Anneliese Straub was her best friend. Her rock, and constant companion. A girl from a nearby village, they had been assigned to the same tank when they were enlisted in the HYGTD. Whereas Alice was quiet, shy, and thoughtful, Annaliese was loud. A fiery girl who had found the dyes and supplies necessary to turn her blonde hair blue, she didn’t abide pointless rules or regulations. She had even shouted the Kommandant into letting her keep the blue hair. 

Annaliese was a sight to behold.

So, when the morning of June 6th, 1944 came, and the Third Reich was invaded in force, she was surprised to find Annaliese crying in her bed. The tanks were mobilizing, even though the two-girl-per-tank rule did not really properly crew any tank. It struck Alice at once. The reason for her tears.

She was lamenting their deaths.

*No.* Not like this. Not here. Those were the thoughts pounding Alice’s head as she dragged Annaliese into the driver’s seat of their Hetzer. Alice even had to *start* the tank for her. The roar of the engine snapped Annaliese back to reality, at least enough to drive. Alice still remembered the shake in her voice as Annaliese asked, “Where are we going?”

For the first time, Alice’s voice was the rock. Alice was, for the first time in her life, the *Commander.*

Her response had been simple.

“East.”

    The Construction of a Manufactorum, of course, 
    is contrary to our wants.
    I felt it was worth the risk of sending scouts, 
    but with such danger I opted to send my 
    smallest, fastest girls.
    Communications Officer Elena, and Loader Nika volunteered.

Elena and Nika were the pair of girls that Alice and Annaliese had found in Poland. Their tank had not been a welcome sight there, yet when Alice and Annaliese parked in a bush to scout for fuel and supplies, these two girls approached the tank. Climbed on it. Were looking for a way in.  When the two girls returned to the tank, they were surprised to find a party waiting for them. 

Vodka. Bread. And the tale of a Blitzkrieg that Alice and Annaliese were all too familiar with. 

Burning homes. SS shooting parents in the streets. Snipers preventing any escape. So, the girls had hidden. Now the town was abandoned, the girls the last citizens of a town that had stood for years.

Casualties of the Third Reich. Casualties of the military that Alice and Annaliese were fleeing. Casualties of a war that *nobody* would win. That nobody could *possibly* win.

At least, not alone.

    Gunner Catherine took use of the stolen Rail Rifle 
    to keep track of the scouts as they infiltrated the city. 
    Not wanting to risk being caught, 
    we opted for Radio Silence. 
    I do not regret this decision. 

The girls were valuable additions to the crew, and Alice was glad she had offered them a spot. Annaliese worried about the girls harboring hatred for the German people, and feared that Annaliese and Alice may fall asleep one night, never to wake up again. If it hadn’t been for Stalingrad, Annaliese may have never slept again. 

Stalingrad changed a lot of things, for a lot of people. It made the threat of the Liberty Army more palpable, and showed *just* how outmatched the USSR and the Germans were. If the Liberty Army could mobilize forces of *that* strength, *that* quickly, the world was already theirs.

But it would not be that way. No, Europe would not go quietly into death.

REGAL-F. The Unified **R**ussian **E**nglish **G**erman **L**and-**F**orces. Teams of soldiers, months ago enemies, now brothers in a desperate war against those who would take the world for their own. In the North, New Berlin was founded as a military installation under REGAL-F.  No more Third Reich. No more Wehrmacht. And no more men in the Panzerkorps. Not enough. So, women were to be Tankers. 

Their records spoke for themselves, especially the crew of Jagdpanther 38(t) “Porcelain Cannon”. Alice, who was known as “Heltzer”, had abandoned her surname, and taken charge in a way that nobody expected. She led her team with efficiency, but also resounded kindness in a way that often got her criticized. She was awarded, merited, and given free reign of her tank. 

She had tested the limits of that on her second operation out, when she came back with a *5th* member of her tank crew. Another girl, but this one in an olive-drab jumpsuit, with the *Red, White, and Blue* of the Liberty Army. 

An *enemy.*

Catherine Forte, Daughter of Rear General Adrian Forte. REGAL-F command saw her as a hostage. Alice cleared the air on that *quite* quick.  Well, Annaliese cleared the air. Nobody shouts quite like that girl. When the dust settled, REGAL-F had a new gunner in the Woman’s Tankery Division.  

    3 hours of preliminary scouting shows that Manufactorum
    Construction nears completion. 
    Recommend Full Force Strike, ASAP.
    -Alice Heltzer, Jr Commander.

-----

It wasn’t exactly a long walk from my office to the office of Commissar Natalia. Still, instead of having one of the spunky, underage trainees that we used as interns deliver this message, I usually opted to do it myself. If I wrote it, I delivered it. Firstly, because I felt it was important to show Natalia that she made the right decision, letting me keep my tank and hand-pick my crew. Secondly, my reports usually contained sensitive information. I didn’t trust any of the teenage girls running around the Office of the Commanders to keep a secret about my *haircare*, let alone classified military information.

Imagine my surprise when I looked up and someone was waiting for me. Catherine Forte was standing at what I can only assume she considered *attention*, her shoulders slouched and her jumpsuit far too loose. Still, she looked happy. 

Or, at least, content. 

“Commander.” She said, approaching me, her blonde hair getting whipped around by the snow, “May I have a word?”  

I had practiced my nod for many weeks, in the private mirror of my quarters. Curt, Polite, and Inviting. It didn’t offend, but was a rapid non-verbal solution to the problem of interpersonal discussion. Catherine took it well.

“W-well,” she started, and I realized whatever she had to say was going to be *long*, so I silently directed her into the private meeting room of the Commander’s Offices. She seemed grateful for the relief from the freezing winds, and offered me a weak smile before beginning again.

“Commander Heltzer, I don’t know if I am going to be a good fit for your tank crew. I have seen the way that most people view me around base. They *loathe* me. They think I am going to call my Father, and wipe this base off the face of the Earth. That couldn’t be farther from the truth, though. I hate my Father. I hate the whole of the ‘Liberty Army.’ We are tyrants and murderers, and if it weren’t for the Tesla Vault, we wouldn’t be doing anywhere near this well in the war.”

She was shaking, whether from rage or the lingering chill, I could not tell.

“I want to fight. I want to win. I want to be with you, who found me, and be with the girls, who I already care deeply for.  I know I haven’t been around long, but can’t I stay?”

Her question caught me off guard. Leave? Sure, she had only been here, like, a month… but there was no question of losing my gunner. 

“You’re staying.” I said, watching her carefully. 5’7. Thin. Pale, like most of us. Blonde hair, down to her shoulder. Red cheeks, frozen from the Siberian winds. Her frame, tucked  away under a loose jacket, was thin, a slight bust, but cute in a tomboyish way. I nodded again, slower, and more deliberately. “Yes. I’ll tell the Commissar, or worse, I’ll have *Annaliese* reinform her. If we can have her recover her hearing after the shouting bit that Annaliese, I am sure she’ll come and confirm it herself.”

With that, I laugh. A more loving, more gentle laugh than I had laughed in a while.

“I have to go turn in my report. I’ll meet you in our bunkhouse, okay? It has been too long since I hung out with the girls.”

-----

Turning in my report was an adventure all its own. A discussion about tactical implications of a fully functioning Manufactorum. 25 minutes of yelling about sending scouts behind enemy lines. More yelling, and a discussion about the nearly impossible record her tank had, and she was done. Dismissed out into the cold winds, with a nearly impossible task.

Bonding with the girls.

Honestly, it was easier to be a Commander, than a friend. Her parents hadn’t raised her to be *friendly*. They had raised her to win. To survive. To lead with honor and distinction, and to be willing to sacrifice anything for those ends. 

These girls weren’t sacrifices. 

Annaliese, with her bright blue hair, and her tendency to yell loudly when people got in her Commander’s way. She was the tallest member of the squad, at 5’10, and also the bustiest. Her jumpsuit was so tight that they didn’t *need* to measure *that* aspect of her. It was there, for all to see. How could Alice order Annaliese into the jaws of death? 

Or Elena, tanned and beautiful, with shiny brown hair and golden eyes? She was always so bubbly and excited just to be in the tank. She was the furthest thing from a warrior she had, but as a Communications Officer, she was top-notch. Concise and kind, she had a knack for getting people to see things in the way that we needed them seen. She was irreplaceable.

Nika would be sorely missed. Her dirty skin and red hair was a welcome sight in the tank, her speed at loading the main gun was impressive, even by Alice’s standards. Sure, she swore frequently, but that was more due to a love of excitement and action than any sort of genuine rage. She was the penultimate tomboy, often confused *for* a boy. She didn’t mind the confusion, though. She took it and ran with it. After all, she was *almost* as much a lesbian as Alice herself.

Maybe that is what made all of it so hard. Annaliese, Elena, Nika, and Catherine were all wonderful, beautiful girls in their own right, but war was no time for dating. War was a time of blood and violence, of long nights and cold tanks, of hopes broken and dreams dashed. Nobody was looking to start a relationship with the Jr. Commander of the most decorated REGAL-F tank in the war. 

So, sighing heavily sighing, I opened the door to the “Porcelain Cannon” bunkhouse. Our home. On the far end, away from the main barracks, stood my private quarters.

That is not where I would be staying tonight.

“Hello girls. I am home.”

-----  

And now, a bit of explanation!

About a week ago, I was walking back from Walmart (which stands an abrasive 2.5 miles away from my apartment,) when my iPhone decided to repeat the English dub of Katyusha. As a big fan of the [Russian Version featured in Girls und Panzer]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx03zTvL4K0), having the song stuck on repeat was no bad thing. 
Three days later, I got to work. What originally started as a Russian Revolution prompt turned into a full blown Alt History story, featuring girls, tanks, and myself as a self-inserted character, as I do with *every prompt I write*. But, more importantly, the girls evolved. Ideas of stories between them, as the girls grow together, danced through my head. These stories were not meant for me to create. They were meant for us to forge together, in the fires of war and passion. 

So, where do you go from here? Well, you can choose to be a girl. Any girl. A new girl. Whatever. I may actually sit back and *write* this, into something more than a DPP prompt. If I do, I may want to use any characters we come up with. So, you know, effort. I don’t expect anyone to spend 4 days crafting this thing, like I did. I don’t expect anything, really.

I love girls. I love tanks. I am *Panzer_Girl*, for goodness sakes. I just wanted to share my loves with you, my loving DPP family.

3pe0tp,8,2015-10-19,"Me (24F) with M24, have been dating for 5 months. Does wanting to take it slow always mean ""he's just not that into you""?",thorwaway1992,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3pe0tp/me_24f_with_m24_have_been_dating_for_5_months/,"John and I have been dating for 5 months. We are exclusive, so we don't see other people. We text every single day, and talk on the phone for hours on most evenings before we go to sleep. We see eachother once or twice a week - my schedule doesn't allow for more for the next 3 months as I am very busy with grad school, internship and work. Our dates sometimes consist of sleeping over, but other times we just do fun things together outside the house (going out for lunch/dinner, shopping together, museums etcetera) without sleeping with eachother. We are affectionate and always hold hands outside, so it's not a friends with benefits sort of thing.


However, there is something that makes me very insecure about what we have, and also about myself. About a week ago we had a fight about something pretty insignificant, but it resulted in me getting emotional and blurting out something that had been bothering me: he doesn't refer to me as his girlfriend, but as ""the girl he is dating"". I told him it makes me feel bad, and asked if this was deliberate and that he didn't want to put a title on what we have. And basically, he said he doesn't want to do that yet. He wants to continue things as they are for a while. He said he has difficulties with things like this, and told me he does take me and what we have seriously, and that he really likes me, but want to take it slow for just some more time.


To him it's about taking it slow and being patient with what we have, and me being understanding. To me this just says that he doesn't like me enough, because if he did he would not doubt for a second to make this official. It makes me feel like there is something wrong with me. And I am scared that I am waiting for something that won't come. I told him I'm not looking for casual dating, that I have been there done that, and that I am looking for something serious. 

This is when I broke things off because I couldn't handle it. We didnt speak for two days, but he was the one who reached out again, and we talked things out. Sorta. He explained that it's just difficult for him and basically asked me for patience. I told him okay, but I just can't stop thinking about it now. 

I have abandonment issues from my extremely problematic relationship with my estranged narcissistic father. He has commitment issues (I assume that this is what that is). Is it worth it to be patient? I really am into him a lot, but my insecurities and sadness are killing me to the extent that I am considering breaking it off permanently this time. Advice?


**TL;DR**: He wants to wait with ""defining the relationship"". To me, this screams commitment issues and him just not liking me enough. I have abandonment issues and don't know if I can be calm and patient enough for this. What to do?

3pe202,29,2015-10-19,Does anyone else have conventionally attractive parents?,cimarafa,ForeverAloneWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneWomen/comments/3pe202/does_anyone_else_have_conventionally_attractive/,"I am 21, but my parents married young and so are in their mid 40s at the moment.  My Dad used to be the stereotypical tall, dark and handsome.  He's bald and got a slight beer belly now but he still has a chiseled face, strong cheekbones, wide shoulders, square jaw etc.. and still gets waitresses flirting with him and when we go to the beach (and he doesn't have his ring), women often ask him out.

And my Mom is still very pretty.  She has blue eyes and blond hair, still works out regularly, has an English accent which guys love, and great bone structure, eyebrows, perfect cheekbones, no facial blemishes or acne, and barely any wrinkles for her age.  If we are having lunch together I guarantee some (usually handsome) guy her age will make the 'are you sisters' comment and try and hit on her.  

She works in advertising and gets offers to be in ads as the 'perfect' wife/mother all the time.  She also jokes about how all her juniors on the team make comments on how attractive she is and laughs about it at dinner.  I know she would never cheat on my Dad but it's clear she enjoys the attention (who wouldn't?). My Dad jokes in reply that he'll shack up with one of his interns and they all have a jolly good laugh about it.

All of that is fine.  Yeah it sucks that their genes cancelled out for me and I'm short, brown-eyed and pale with messy brunette hair, no curves, wide shoulders for a girl, and a face that is both masculine and ugly feminine, but I don't blame them for it- they didn't choose my appearance and I'm happy for them that they get to experience life as beautiful people.  

But I HATE when they try and lecture me on how to get a boyfriend or be social.  My Dad will tell me to ""just ask guys out"" because ""boys love being asked on dates"".  Not by girls like me, dad, not by girls like me.  Once he said ""I would have been flattered if your mother asked me out"" and I was like ""exactly"".  

And my Mom is even worse.  You should hear some of her stories. She once flew to the Canary Islands with nowhere to stay except some shitty hostel, ended up shacking up with some minor Spanish noble in his mansion for a week after meeting him at the airport. Once, she went on a tour of South America in a camper van and ended up going out with some hot Brazilian guy who was the son of a banking tycoon.  Apparently pawning the jewellery he gave her paid for my parents' entire wedding, which I'm pretty sure is a joke but still. My mom is desired by men today so just imagine what it was like 20 years ago. (fyi according to my brother, my dad has stories like this too, but fortunately has decided that his daughter probably doesn't want to know).

And you know what she told me last week? ""[My Name], go to [very expensive bar] in a nice dress and go on a date with the first attractive, nice guy your age who asks you out"".  The idea of going to a bar and not having men hit on her is unimaginable.  She cannot conceive of a world in which women don't get treated like goddesses by men.  

And it fucking pisses me off.

3peav9,3,2015-10-19,26M4F Seeking bad girls; many prompts!,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3peav9/26m4f_seeking_bad_girls_many_prompts/,"So I've got a soft spot for bad girls. ;)

I'm around all night and looking to get as filthy as possible. I've got several prompts below, but I'm also open to working a completely-different scene out as long as it stays away from my dislikes. When you respond, send me your likes/dislikes, too; I'm a giver, and it REALLY gets me off to know you're enjoying yourself as we do this.

Some prompts/ideas below:

1) It's your standard party scene. You pick the venue (night club, pool party, strip club, etc.), but regardless of the location, it's hopping, with booze flowing and scantily-clad women (and maybe men, too) running around looking absolutely perfect. Whether you're a partygoer, a bartender, a stripper/hooker, or any other role you can imagine, you're out tonight for one reason: To get fucked hard.

2) You're an intern at the office I work in. We don't deal with each other much, other than idle chit-chat. However, in my side job editing video for some shady clients, I notice a familiar face working a stripper pole and giving lap dances. It's you, and I wait until we're alone in the office to confront you with the evidence.

3) I've married an older woman and have entered into an open relationship. My new wife has a daughter younger than me, and you're her best friend. We've been thinking of you as a bad influence, but lately, my eyes have been more drawn to a body that's absolutely built for sex. You and my step-daughter come home late one night, and my wife isn't around.

4) I'm at the gym and can't concentrate. Every time I go, you're there, strutting your stuff in an ill-fitting sports bra and short shorts that barely constrain your juicy ass. You turn heads and you know it, and one day I work up the courage to introduce myself.

5) I've just moved into the neighborhood as a single guy, and my new place is right next door or across the street from you. This opens up a myriad of possibilities; maybe you're a college girl, a similarly-aged younger professional, or even a MILF, but either way, you eye the new single guy in the neighborhood and are curious.

6) Anything else you can think of that doesn't fit my dislikes!

My kinks: Big breasts/titfucking, bimbos/bimbofication, dirty talk (the raunchier the better), oral sex (giving and receiving), group sex, multiple orgasms/cumplay, bad girls (partying/drinking/smoking all encouraged).

My no-go's: Animals, bathroom stuff, blood/gore, heavy BDSM, incest, noncon.

Hope to hear from you!"

Cersei Lannister: I'd love to play a guard that she takes a liking to and is actually able to 'make' her do things that she wouldn't normally. She likes his assertiveness and the fact that he is unafraid to tell the queen to bend over like a common whore, or get on her knees and swallow no matter how little she cares to do so.

Daenerys: For her, I'd love to play someone that can take her away from her 'Queenly' state and make her feel like a dirty young girl again. Whether that's one of her closest bodyguards, a trusted adviser, or a soldier for her army..... or maybe she gives her body up as a prize to a much needed ally perhaps?

Shae: After all that she did? I just want to treat her like a whore at the whorehouse.... Is that so much to ask?

Others: Arya Stark, Catelyn Stark, Margaery Tyrell

---House of Lies---

Jeannie: Obvious one here, but I'd play almost anyone against her in some fashion. A new boyfriend that is truly her baby daddy... A past fling coming back in to her life and wooing her .... A booty call on a business trip that turns in to something slightly more serious.... Etc etc!

Monica: She needs a nice young stud to keep her busy, doesn't she? I'm thinking an intern that she tries to belittle and finally wants to ease a bit of tension and then realizes just how big of a boy he is ... and it draws her to him more and more even if they really don't get along on a personal level.

Others: April, Sarah Guggenheim, Marisa McClintock, Brynn

---The Office---

Pam Beesley: Something without Jim would be fantastic. Whether she's desperate at her apartment after breaking up with Roy that she'll give herself up to the landlord for more time/lesser rent... Maybe she's lonely and lets a warehouse guy take her for a ride that she can't help but want to relive on a nearly daily basis? Or an intern that she catches taking a liking to her and who knows where they go from there!

Jan: Another cougar that needs a young man. She's shown many times over that she loves interns and younger men in general!

Erin: Someone very dominate for her since she seems to be unsure/innocent... and she needs somebody that can break her of that streak.

Kelly: I have a feeling that she'd use just about anyone to make Ryan jealous. Let's give her a new person to do just that with. We can figure out if he's a perfect fit for her or just a guy with a dick that can shut her up for a few minutes at a time while they do some dirty things with one another!

Others: Angela, Meredith, Holly Flax....

Feel free to toss almost anyone else at me too as I'm sure I've missed some! Looking for something potentially long-term but I'm more then happy with just doing one scene if you'd rather go that route!

3pf2iw,5,2015-10-19,I (33/m) am thinking about breaking it off with my fiancé (32/f) because of her lack of direction and effort...,Lostndamaged,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3pf2iw/i_33m_am_thinking_about_breaking_it_off_with_my/,"I've been spend a lot of time thinking about ending my relationship with my fiancé recently.  We have been together for nearly 7 years with a small three month break in the middle.  We (officially) got engaged three months ago.  This post isn't about the proposal or the engagement so I digress for a moment.



I asked her to marry me the first time on her fathers death bed in the hospital back in May.  Her father, divorced, had moved back to his home town, to live closer to us.  We had become friends and I was devastated that I didn't get to ask him about marrying his daughter.  She said yes, but I was going to have to do it again.



Shortly there after, we designed a custom ring and had it made.  The Jeweler accidentally emailed her when the ring as done, so there was not any surprise that the ring was done and I had it. 



I started a job in August that has me working 60-70 hours a week and takes me through Christmas.  In September I took a day off work so we could attend a concert in the evening.  As we were packing for the concert she made some comment along the lines of ""well you better pop the question tonight or your going to have to not do it for a while...""



So I brought it along and popped the question before the show in our seats.  She said yes and seemed excited.  Turned out she didn't really like the proposal and was hoping I would do something cuter or sweeter.  The proposal isn't why I am thinking about ending it with her, I guess I am just giving some backstory as to why I would want to end it with someone 3 months after proposing.  



Did I mention my younger brother got married after just a two and a half year courtship?  That defiantly pushed the ""so when are WE getting engaged"" button.



Today, I am wrestling with a ""deal breaker"" that has been present throughout our entire relationship.  To me, she does not ""do"" enough.



Throughout our relationship her employment record has been spotty at best.  When I first met her she managed a store in the mall.  She made a good salary.  That lasted for about the first six months.  She ""quit/got fired"" her job in such a way that she could collect unemployment.  She said she didn't move here to work in a store at the mall and wanted to put her degree in Public Relations to use.  I understood completely and supported her decision.  



Initially she had a full year of maximum benefit unemployment.  She didn't begin looking for her next job job until the unemployment was almost out.  At that point she began taking unpaid internships at PR companies around town.  After the first year of unemployment she was able to apply for an extension and continued working for free at one PR place or another.  The internships were not full time.  None of her PR internships led to employment.



After her unemployment ran out she started doing some odd jobs / personal assistant work for a wealthy-ish female friend of hers.  The friend would pay my fiancé to travel with her, run errands, etc.  That helped chip in on the rent from time to time but nothing consistent.  This was coupled with rarely working around our apartment.  She would rarely take out the trash or do the dishes much less clean the place.



After being in the relationship for four years I had enough with her lack of ambition and we broke up.  We took a three month hiatus over the holidays.  I slept with someone else (she knows).  I agreed to pick her up from the airport.  I had slept about three hours.  I broke down in tears in the car.  We got back together.  She promised to get her act together.



A few months after our breakup, she finally got a job.  Back in the same type of mall store she was working in before, except she wasn't the manager.  She didn't get along with the manager at the first store.  She got transferred to another store further away.  She worked there another few months.  After the summer the company said they had to cut back their hours and they were no longer going to be able to employ her.  She went back on unemployment.  Took the occasional odd job from her friend.



Soon though she was able to find another job, but I hated that job for her for reasons she was indifferent about.  I am a union trade worker and the place she was working at was breaking labor law left and right, treating their daily employees as 1099 independent contractors, not providing restrooms and hardly paying anything at all.  She worked their for 4-5 months until her father passed away.  They wanted her to come back to work two days after her father died right in front of her.  She tried to go back to work but we both decided it would be best if she left so she could focus on the family and anything to do with the estate.  She did receive a decent life insurance policy from her father, equal to about year of my wages.



Now here we are, almost seven months after the death of her father.  She is listless.  She spends most of the day looking at things on the Internet.  Saying she is ""researching.""  She wants to use the life insurance money to finance her own swimwear line.  The most work she has put into that are a handful of sketches.  The most To the best of my knowledge she has not applied for a single job, much less had an interview.  She sleeps most of the morning (until 11a usually).  She does a little of her ""research"" then goes and hangs out with a friend or has a friend come over until I get off work.  



She has a large list of things to do but does none of them; She has to get the title changed on her deceased fathers car, needs to get the puppy spayed, there is a 25lb. bag of walnuts sitting on the bedroom floor that were supposed to be distributed as a remembrance to her father, her suitcase sits packed for a trip she made three weeks ago, her laundry hamper overflows in the closet. Additionally she has a large student debt she only recently began paying and she owes a small amount of back taxes.



I don't know what to do.  Often times when I bring up these issues the fight changes from me asking ""why you don't take care of this stuff"" changes into ""I don't like how you are talking to me.""  And yes, when we get into this stuff I can be condescending because it seems like this is stuff an regular adult takes care of.   



As an addendum, she has been taking prescription medication for panic / anxiety attacks since we began dating.  I am not sure of the exact names but I do know that Bradley cooper and Jen Lawrence mention the meds she is on in their scene where they discuss each other's meds in Silver Linings Playbook.  She has not had an anxiety / panic attack in quite a few years but continues the medication nightly. The meds make her very sleepy and when she ""goes off"" the meds she is more irritable and is more moody because she says she has a hard time sleeping while off the pills.  As for me, I self medicate with pot.



All that being said, I do really love her.  She is for the most part a pleasure to be around, very outgoing, sweet person.  The kind of person I would want to spend my life with.  But unfortunately I feel like I do much more work and she is not contributing even a close to an equal amount to our ""home.""



Thanks for readings.  Any advice or thoughts you all might have is appreciated.  I am just glad I got this off my chest to somebody.




TL;DR I am thinking about breaking up with my fiancé because she does not have a job or work at home."
3pfauz,5,2015-10-19,What are you doing with your life?,CL95,AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/3pfauz/what_are_you_doing_with_your_life/,"I'm in my junior year of college and am slowly realizing I don't have any clue what I want to do with my life. I'm double majoring in my business school right now and have pretty mediocre grades, mostly Bs &amp; Cs. I've hated most of my time at college and feel like I made the wrong choice and wasted my time here. I  have thought about transferring majors/universities, but never had the grades/couldn't afford to and my parents would never let me drop school all together, so I've been feeling kind've stuck. Right now my plan is to just apply to internships and see what sticks. If I can't find a decent job with my major I just plan on working in restaraunta my whole life since that's what a lot of my fanily does. 

I don't know if I'm having a ""quarter-life crisis"" or whatever, but the thought of what I'm doing for the rest of my life terrifies me because I don't have an answer. My bad grades make me feel like college was a waste of time and money and have me extremely pessimisitic about the future, but I can't cut my losses because of what my family and friends expecf of me.

With all that being said, what are you doing with your life?"
3pfhgv,2,2015-10-19,I feel worthless,throwaway__707,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3pfhgv/i_feel_worthless/,"Incoming wall of text, sorry about that. Can't really find a way to put this concisely. It's probably too much information but I guess that's what this sub is for.

Basically, I'm 16. I'm a junior at a charter arts highschool. After academic instruction, there are 3 additional hours of arts education. Add to that an hour long commute, and homework, and well, I'm occupied from 6:30am to around 8-9pm most days. This wasn't forced upon me by any means, I just fucked up by volunteering for it. I don't think switching schools is really an option because I don't want to mess with my college chances, but: I hate it. I didn't always, but I do now after three years of picking between sleep and free time (and sometimes having neither).  I don't think the workload, or the stress, is really an issue, but the routine gets to me. The feeling that my days are all equally meaningless. I guess that's what ""the real world"" is like, but I think I'd probably rather be working 9-5 than this. It doesn't help that I'm involved with a paid internship which is occupying a great deal of my weekends.

Anyway, that's not really what I want to write about, but it gives an idea of the monotony of my life. I think the other things would be easier to deal with if I had more time for reflection and relaxation, but I'm pretty short on that. I don't mean to complain, just give some context to my story.

The main reason for my utter lack of self-esteem is my social situation. There are basically two types of people I talk to:

* The art school kids. Oh boy, don't get me started. They're nice people, usually, but they're just...losers. Like, if you took a truckload of Reddit and Tumblr stereotypes, and crushed them all together, you'd get some idea. The neckbeardism is strong here. (And it isn't just guys, btw.) They're socially awkward, unfashionable, have bad taste...I just don't really enjoy spending time with these people now that I'm a junior.

* The ""cool"" people. Friends who listen to the same types of music as me, dress well, have relationships, hang out, smoke, drink, party etc. I dislike even using the word ""cool"" cuz it feels like the sort of thing only a highschooler would care about, but honestly, these people are just a hell of a lot more fun to chill with. And are actually socially well adjusted.

The problem is that I'm sorta in between. I know that talking about politics and growing patchy facial hair doesn't make me the most mature adolescent ever, but I'm also a virgin who's never smoked a day in his life (meanwhile my friends are popping pills I've never even *heard* of.) I know bad fashion when I see it, but I also don't have the money to dress well. I'm ""cool"" enough to identify who's worth talking to, but not cool enough for them to really be interested in me. I hear about all the partying, but never get invited. I don't think people even see me as a loser, necessarily - I'm just an afterthought, pretty much invisible. The other day my friends were talking about hanging out in front of my face - didn't think to invite me. I'm not the type to invite myself, so it would have been nice for them to at least offer. This sounds pretty self pitying, but it's just the way things are.

I've also never dated anyone, which makes things worse. I'm not the ""foreveralone xDD, why don't girls talk to me"" type but when people ask about my relationship experience it sounds fucking pathetic that the only thing I've done is mess around online with a guy almost a decade older than me and half the country away. When the doctor asks, ""do you date girls or boys?"" I want to answer ""both"" but unfortunately, ""neither"" is closer to the truth. There's a girl I've liked since freshman year, and though we're close friends, she isn't ever gonna feel the same way about me (asexuality...) I'm also short and skinny, and pretty disproportionate (my upper body is tiny compared to the rest of me), details which my female friends never fail to remind me of. I could stomach the teasing with confidence when I was 14 because I was sure I'd grow into a more natural body. Now I'm not so sure. I feel like I'm supposed to be nearly done growing but I'm only 5'6"" and maybe 140lbs. I'm also pale as hell, another feature often made fun of by my (mostly nonwhite) friend group. Whatever fit means, I'm the opposite, and I wear braces for another year. IDK how I'll ever see myself as attractive or worth dating.

I feel like these are issues you're supposed to deal with in middleschool, but I had a strange experience and never did, so here I am at sixteen with almost no experience to speak of in how to hang out, date, get high, and it seems like I've missed the boat all my friends are sailing off on.

Some shit happened today that made me feel worse, but this is pretty much my daily routine, and I feel progressively more awful each day. I haven't have suicidal thoughts in a while, but they're starting to come back. I just wish I was more accepted into these social groups. I don't know what else to put, I just wanted to sum up all my problems I guess.

I wouldn't mind advice if you have some, but please don't tell me something about how ""coolness"" is irrelevant and you should just love yourself and be who you are, or whatever. I bought into that bullshit for the first two years of HS but it's just nonsense. ""Peer pressure"" is just being a normal teenager and growing up. ""Don't hang out with negative people"" is also shitty advice - they're my friends and I'd defend them to the ends of the earth. Yeah, they talk a lot of shit, but in the end they're all I have.

Coming here feels pathetic but I need somewhere to vent. I just hate myself so much today, and this seems healthier than my usual approaches (drinking and blasting The Weeknd)"
3pfmc0,0,2015-10-19,"Concerning whether young people in their early 20s should save or not [current personal experience, a long story]",Haki_User,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3pfmc0/concerning_whether_young_people_in_their_early/,"Was at work when I read [u/lost_in_blizzard's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3p9948/to_the_young_of_personalfinance/) and I must say that his message made me feel proud and satisfied with myself. However the thread rises a very important question, which is whether young people in their early &amp; mid twenties should save, or if it's totally okay to work and live the party life from paycheck to paycheck.  I'll give my personal opinion basing on an experience that I lived and I am living at the moment.  
I graduated from the university at the age of 22, started searching for a job because ""Yaay! I just got out of the uni let's start making money"" So I started applying for positions here and there, quite hopeful that I'll be hearing from many companies very soon and I'll have various job positions to choose from whichever fits me. Well, after applying I waited a month, nothing. Another month... nothing, 3 months... Nothing... 4 Months and still nothing, I didn't hear from anyone. I graduated at the top of my class and had very good grades so I was very optimistic about finding a very rewarding job but eventually I realized that I was terribly wrong. Not everyone is willing to hire a recently graduate with no experience, also the economy in my country isn't so great, which is a fact I ignored for some reason when I was studying, not that I didn't know it, I just thought that I'll be better and luckier than most, I wasn't.   
Anyway on the 5th month of staying at my family's home, which is in probably the most boring city in the country that if I hadn't Internet access I would've probably lost my mind, depression and intense negative thoughts started to crawl in. ""What did I waste all these college years for? Why was I so hard working when everyone were having fun? I'll never find a job, I wish I at least partied the hell out of my college years everyday like my friends, eventually I graduated on the top of the class and I'm not better than any of them, I got out of it with nothing. No career, and no fun memories"" I kept putting myself down and feeding these thoughts even though they were far from true, I did have a lot of fun in college, it's just that unlike my friends I managed to balance it out, I balanced fun with studying, and I actually eventually got out of college with both goods, not none, like my depressed negative mind was telling me.  
After I got too blue, too lost and too depressed on the fifth month I decided to leave the city, go to the city where some of my friends were still studying and haven't finished yet, catch up with what I thought I missed. And that's what I did, I lived with a few of my college friends and spent days hanging around, chasing girls, staying late drinking (moderately). I was trying to catch up with what I missed and at the same time entertain myself away from the fact that I was unemployed and have no idea what to do next with my life, because it was a problem that despite my intelligence I couldn't solve, it was a problem only time could solve as I was already doing everything I can. Anyway, one might wonder where did I get the money to live several months and party with my friends? It was from my mother. It wasn't too much, just what she used to give me monthly when I was still studying, I know that she understood perfectly what I was going through, and I know she understood perfectly what I was trying to do to cope with the situation.    
Another 4 months passed of enjoying time with friends and the emptiness and doubt started to kick in. What am I doing? I know I'm trying to have fun but I'm going nowhere like this, and I'm also taking money from my mother for vain, I am here with no real purpose! So I looked for an internship and started doing one in that same city. It made me feel a lot better, it gave me a sense of having a job, it gave me a solid reasonable purpose to be where I was, and I also was given some rewards from the boss every now and then, which made me feel much better not for the financial value because it was quite low, but morally. I really felt like I started working.  
2 months after starting the internship I got a phone call, a company I applied for months ago said that they were interested in my resume and would like if I was available for an interview, Fuck yeah I'm available! ""But the city in which our company is located is pretty far from yours, don't you have a problem with that?"", the HR on the pone asked. ""no"", I answered. ""Hell I would move to Antarctica for a descent job"" I thought. We arrange the date of the interview, I do well in it, I'm hired!   
I borrow money from my father to pay for rent and first month expenses, I live with a few tourism-uni party all the time type guys, and I start working. My salary would be equal to 2000$/month US money at the very least, 4000$/month at most or (48k per year) at most. Plus commission which would go from 500$ to 7500$ at the very least, or 1000$ to 15000$ at most. Most people, I realize later, are in the job mainly for the commission, as it most of the time exceeds the salary.   
Anyway, I start very anxious, I'm in a different city that I'm not used to, different people, different traditions, I find a hard time to fit in as I am essentially introverted, at work I find myself slower than most at grasping concepts, my performance is lower than most even the ones that started at the same time as I, I'm not fitting in, I survive the first month and the second month because whenever I left work and went home I'd find the crazy bunch of young tourism-students willing to hit the club and have fun, or just have plenty of fun at home. I merged in with them which made me reduce the work anxiety on a daily basis, but after some time I started  setting limits and telling them off every now and then. They had rich parents and wouldn't mind partying all the time and spending money, but I was not, I just started working with a not so great salary, I am performing weekly, feeling anxious everyday that I'll be kicked out of the job, go back to my home city, my depressive home city, stay there unemployed... God! That thought visited me at work every few minutes and it caused me stomach knots and overall intense stress and anxiety. It also made me weak and I couldn't speak about my own rights or what I wanted and needed at work because of the ""I'm gonna get fired, go back to my city, be a failure"" circle-jerk idea that kept visiting me. After that I moved to another place, which was farer and cheaper. And then I got even more anxious and stressed,  as I no longer have the luxury of going out with friends and hit the club to relieve the stress. No, all I got now after coming home from a stressful day is my lonely room... Damn.  
But throughout all of this I did something that I'm proud of, something that paid off very well... I somehown even though I was going to clubs and drinking, managed to save 500$ every month (I also got some small fee side job every now and then which helped me manage to save the 500$) . Now after 6 months I have 3000$ in saving account and believe me, it changed me! I became much more confident at work, much more relaxed, I can speak my mind now to a great extent, if I saw that I'm being underpaid or not getting what I deserve I'd talk about it, if there is a better opportunity for me in the same company I'd go for it and baldly express my desire to have it. Also my performance improved dramatically, This month I have thus far made 1500$ in commission only, and the month has yet to end. I feel at ease, I feel self-worthy, and more than all I feel proud.   
Why is the 3000$ I'm saving making me feel all of this? Well because now I don't have to be anxious about losing my job as much as I was before, even if I was let go I could stay another 6 months in this city and find another job in the same field which is quite easy to do once you have the experience, which I do now. I also plan on reaching a 6k in savings by the end of this month. Which is quite amazing since I get to save in one month the amount that took me 5 months to collect. I'll also have a 500$ spare of my salary to party and have fun, another 500$ spare for clothes because if you look good, you feel good.    
**tl;dr** Bottom line and my advice to the youth in the early 20's to whom I belong. **Do save enough to survive the estimated time-span between losing a job and finding a new one**, which is 3 to 9 months roughly. Any saving other than that is not mandatory, but if you feel like it, do it. Enjoy your youth, go to parties, hit clubs and spend, but moderately, as much your salary allows and not as much as others are spending. And remember that the biggest winner is the one that comes out of youth with all of it, and believe me if you have an average salary and you are wise enough, you can do it.   "

I will be graduating Dec 2015 with 150 credit hours and with my masters degree in accounting. Over the summer I had a great internship at a F500 under the corporate controller's office. I really loved it and the people were great, they just really encouraged getting the experience of public accounting first and, of course, Big 4. While there I met with some people from PwC and had a lunch with some seniors. However, I still wasn't sure if it would be right for me considering I can be very socially anxious and I was still unsure if I would really fit in with that whole ""Big 4 mentality."" 

A lot of the managers and also the controller told me to reach out to them and they would contact hiring manager/recruiter at PwC just to help get my foot in the door if I found myself interested in pursuing that. However, with that, I still find myself second guessing myself and beating myself down that I wouldn't be good enough or smart enough for the Big 4, since I come from a non-target school, my more introverted personality, etc. Recruiting season came by and only regional, national, and local firms actively recruit on my campus. So I submitted my resume, and got around 5 interviews but only one second round interview, still waiting to hear back from two more (which was probably due my anxiety over interviewing). 

The rejection from the two top 15 firms is also contributing to my felling of being inadequate even though I did not find myself particularly clicking with any of the firms. The second round interview was with a very small local CPA firm that deals with a niche market but I would have the opportunity to both work in audit and tax. I received the offer letter today I have about 10 days to respond but the start date is still a few months out. However, I feel like I am going to regret not at least giving myself a shot to try something different by playing it safe all the time. 

Therefore, what would be the best way to reach out to my so called ""network."" They are not intimidating at all I just keep psyching myself out of actually emailing them because I don't want to come across as being needy. I think it is just the general idea of asking someone to do a favor for me that doesn't sit well with me, especially if for whatever reason it doesn't work out if I don't end up getting hired or I realize it's not for me. On the other side I feel like they may be more offended if I don't bother reaching out to them because they really encouraged me to keep in touch with them. As you can see I put sometimes way to much thought into my decisions that I end up not being able to decide one way or another. So any advice would be much appreciated. 

Edit: Thanks for all of your advice, it was exactly what I needed to hear :)"

It was an incredible job, I learned so much and the workers there made me feel amazing. 

But still, even with this achievement, I still don't have a feeling of greatness, like I never got the job, like I never did anything successful. Other's do look at me as a greater man, but I don't see that in myself, and for a month now I have been seeking validation from others who did nothing over the summer, I've been seeking something I should already have.

It might be because I am practicing humility, and not being as show offy as I was before. 

I just honestly want to be the man that should have gained super confidence from this achievement.

Some factors I was dealing with over the summer: I had a terrible roommate who made me feel lesser half the time (I've moved out now), and I was dealing with (sorta dealing with currently) a oneitis.

Have you guys experienced this, or got an answer to my search for validation?

It didn't work out because I wanted a bigger commitment than she was not able to provide so early in our relationship. She said when I get back from my internship maybe we could be in love the right way, but space is best for now.

That was four months ago, and I've haven't gotten a word from her. A month ago I accidentally texted her a pic of me (unflattering, because it was legitimately accidental) and immediately apologized. No word. Today was my birthday, and no happy birthday from her.

I feel like, if I meant as much to her as she said while we were together, that she'd tell me if she's no longer interested. I thought it'd make sense, it would save both of us trouble. But I haven't heard a word from her. She just likes some of my stuff on facebook, and she checks every single one of my snapstories, but I feel embarrassed to say that it gives me hope.

I plan on visiting in October (in a week), just to pop in the coffee shop she works at to buy a drink, say hi, and leave her alone. Other than that, I don't return to our college until January. Do I leave her alone and wait for January, or go forth with my plan in a week and see how she reacts? Or, should I drop the assumption that she'd tell me she's done with me, and forget about her?

Sorry for choppy sentences, drink and alone on my birthday and didn't want to waste anyone's time.

Since girls generally have it tougher emotionally than guys, this often leads to guys giving lots of emotionally support to their girlfriends. Listening, talking, letting her vent, providing a shoulder to cry on etcetera.

But how much emotional support can a guy expect from a girl? And in which way? This is, to be honest, not a very masculine question, because men generally are the tougher of the two. 

The reason why I am asking this is because in my last relationship of 3 years I had the feeling that my relationship was emotionally very one-directional. But it could be I had the wrong expectations, so I hope someone could shed some insight or experiences.

So I am 24m and she is 21f and this was both our first real relationship. We were crazy about each other. Emotionally she was very unstable. Little things made her cry all the time and it was clear that this was more than normal. The first two years I was always comforting her and supporting her. I sometimes felt a bit like her caregiver/dad, but I didn't care cause I loved her.

After a year we had a strange fight and she told what was bothering her, that she was molested when she was very young. I was the first person she ever told and I didn't saw it coming. I helped her go to a support group and therapist, and she noticably improved emotionally. She could hold her ground way better and seemed way more stable, which she also noted herself.

But then after 2 years it changed. I am studying medicine and I had it very tough in the hospitals. I was an intern and worked basically 40 hours a week at different specialisations. All my friends were sent off to different hospitals and I was living not near them. To combat the loneliness in the hospital I joined a group to organise stuff for charity. This turned out a terrible choice and made my life even more stressful.

Twice after work I was crying an hour in the bathroom, doubting if I could become a doctor. I had trouble coping with the hospital life, which is common. I talked with other interns about this.

However my girlfriend was very indifferent towards it. I felt she was never there for me when it was going bad at internship. That she was oblivious to my stresses and doubts. When I told her about the stresses of my life she just sighed a lot. She doesn't study medicine, but still it felt bad. She was not mean to me, but oblivious and didn't really want to get involved. This all happened gradually, but it became more and more severe. Some months after I had that breakdown in the hospital I brought it up again, and she was like: 'Huh? When did you cry?'. That stung a lot, and it felt like she had literally no clue that I was even feeling bad. It was like she was there with me in positive times, but was absent in the tough times.

Aside from not understanding my problems our relationship went ok, we did fun things together etcetera. But I felt sometimes living in a different reality than my own girlfriend because of this. At some point there was an event coming up that I was really stressed out for, and she knew this. After the event she never asked about how it went, or anything about it really. Meanwhile I was supporting her in the problems of her studies. Thats when I realized the balance was completely off. Actually, with her friends I also realized that she could be sometimes very not-understanding about why people do stuff.

We then had a big fight about this fact, I told her I didn't feel supported, understood or helped at all. She didn't really change (obviously) and eventually we broke it off. After the breakup she told that she sometimes feels she has trouble with empathy. Maybe that was the problem.

Her mother was also very indifferent to my gf's emotional problems and when something was wrong she went to her dad or me. Sometimes I recognized her mum in my gf, in a sense that she needed a lot of support, but just couldn't give it. However, she is not at all a bad girlfriend in the other senses.

Thanks for reading my long post. I really hope my expectations weren't wrong, because that means that I lost a pretty and fun girlfriend with no empathy. Can a guy also expect some support? Or should I've never expected understanding from my girlfriend and just toughen it up.

TL;DR: Just came out of a 3 years relationship, felt there was no emotional support from her. Are my expectations wrong?"

I am a freshman at a semi-target school (ivy-league, not harvard or wharton). I currently intend to major in math and computer science. I have already been creating codes and trading using algorithms for a while, but I have no prior professional experience such as an internship at a quant fund. I was wondering how feasible it would be for me to obtain an internship at a quant fund. Also, what advice do you have for me to increase my chances of landing an internship, if not now then in the future?

Thank you for your time"
3piti7,69,2015-10-20,[REQUEST][STEAM] Fallout 4,AlphaArBar,GiftofGames,https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/3piti7/requeststeam_fallout_4/,"**Version 2 new and improved!**

**Leaving the Vault...**

Hey everyone /u/AlphaArBar here and today as you can guess from the name of the titles I will be requesting Fallout 4 for the second time. 

**Important!** Now before we begin I just want to comment about pre-ordering! Okay, I know some people are against it and some people don't care about it. I understand both sides completely and can see how both make their points. All I am going to say is if you are unwilling to purchase the game as a pre-order as a gift, that is fine. I respect that completely. However if someone was willing to buy the game for me a few weeks after it has been released, I will be more than happy to accept and wait even longer if something like this was to happen. I understand the some people hate pre-orders as some think it devalues or otherwise causes the game companies to become lazy and launch their game as fast as they can without bug fixes and the such only to upset the masses. However I thought I would still request while the waters seem pretty tame here for now and while the decent requests don't get flooded with the low attempt ones.

This time around though I thought I would up the ante to include pictures, stories about why I love the Fallout franchise all the way from Fallout 1 -&gt; New Vegas. So let's get this started.
____________________________________________________________________________
**Leading up to the war...**

So I am not sure if any of you remember but back before Fallout 4 was announced years ago there were rumors that it was in the making. You'd see and hear whispers on the internet about how some research was being done in Boston and how it would be set there, however nobody believed this. Or at least I didn't. That was until the infamous countdown appeared a long time later. [This is the site here](http://thesurvivor2299.com) for anyone interested. It isn't anything anymore though. But this is when the hype got real, well sort of. I wouldn't admit it to myself as it seemed suspicious that a game would be announced like this. However I was intrigued at the idea and watched the clock count down, albeit a little cautious.

I can still remember the night I watched it tick to zero and then the feeling. I think everyone just face palmed while the people behind it laughed their asses off. I must admit, it was good. They managed to trick just about everyone. It's just a shame Bethesda never spoke up or debunked it before it happened. I guess they wanted to see what happened in the end, just like everyone else who was following along with it. However after having my dreams of another Fallout dashed and shattered.(Not really, but I was pretty sad for a few days) I returned to normal life, accepting I wasn't going to be getting another Fallout anytime soon. After that I felt a little skeptic to everything I heard relating to Fallout 4 believing nothing I heard and just waiting for official news from an actual official, such a a developer. That day then came..
____________________________________________________________________________
**When the bombs fell...**

And so it happened. The bomb had been dropped, the day had come. We were getting [Fallout 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5esyZPt5Jo&amp;ab_channel=BethesdaSoftworks). After it was announced I felt joy, I'd be returning to the wasteland once again. I felt happiness. I just felt everything a child feels when they wake up on Christmas day and seeing their presents under the tree that a big ol' man had dropped by the night before. Except I was excited to be able to blow that man up and then loot his unique outfit. It was great. We were finally getting Fallout 4. 

During the presentation all I could do was try to get rid of my goosebumps. The music, it was amazing. I felt it, the concept art. The gameplay, the visuals, atmosphere. Everything. It was just amazing. I knew that it would be worth the wait. The new customization, the new building. The possibilities for it all to be expanded in the modding of the game. It was all looking like it was worth the wait. And not only that but they also released another game that night. [Fallout Shelter.](http://www.falloutshelter.com/) I sat by my iPad that night. Refreshing and refreshing over and over waiting to download it as soon as it was released. In the end I had to go to sleep as it was very late but that morning I woke up, I got it, played it and loved it. It was the ultimate gift. A free mobile game to go along with possibly one of my most anticipated games ever. And it was coming so so soon...
____________________________________________________________________________
**And so the smoke settles...**

And so the smoke of the announcement had settled. I accepted what had happened and began to get hyped and looking forward of what was to come. I revisited my old Fallout games. Of which I own: (Time does not represent actual time I have spent in the game. Trust me, I have played both on console too for countless hours and in Steam on offline mode. The very reason I actually joined Steam is actually because I had to in order to play New Vegas back when it was released. My very first game registered on it was in fact, Fallout New Vegas. Back then I did not have internet so I had no choice but to play in offline mode and the same goes for Fallout 3 GOTY which is why my time counters are very low.)

1: [Two copies of Fallout 1. One in physical form part of the trilogy and the other on GoG.com.](http://imgur.com/1bEA7fN.png)

2: [One copy of Fallout 2. One physical (I did have 3 but I gave one to a friend as a gift for his birthday)](http://imgur.com/biixC2G.png)

3: [One Fallout Tactics, Part of the trilogy physical form.](http://imgur.com/biixC2G.png)

4: [One Fallout 3 GOTY, Steam.](http://i.imgur.com/euAyyuG.png)

5: [Two Fallout New Vegas GOTY, physical PC, physical XBOX 360](http://imgur.com/9GSI2Jm.png) and on [Steam](http://imgur.com/89qsSdp.png)

I actually came across Fallout 2 and 1 by chance too. One day I was in a regular shop buying some milk. It wasn't in my hometown, but I was on my way home. When I arrived at the counter I noticed they had a small box of PC games all of which for €2. I looked in it and saw Fallout 2 and I thought why the hell not. Sealed, brand new. I thought where could I go wrong so I bought it went home and fell in love.

The game, while it did feel old felt like it didn't hold back. Back in a day where anything could go in games. One thing I remember in Fallout 3 was trying to kill the little boy and girl in Megaton because they were so annoying but sadly was not allowed. Well in Fallout 2, you could waltz into town and aim your mini-gun and blast anyone and everyone away. Including the little beggar thief children or stranger you see. It felt like making a mistake in the game mattered through your choices. 

Also, your intelligence was a major thing in the older games too. If you choose super low intelligence, the game was completely different. If you had 1 intelligence you'd be very very dumb in game and it would show so in the gameplay chatting screen.Obviously this limited you in major ways as you were very stupid and unable to do many quests because of this but it is amazing that the developers even went to these lengths to allow something like this to even happen in the first place.
____________________________________________________________________________
**What makes you wish for a nuclear winter?**

Travelling the Mojave of course. But seriously, the thing I love about the Fallout games is the atmosphere. The feeling of loss. The feeling of dread, death and no hope. The feeling that everything that was is now gone and buried under a mountain of bodies and a sea of blood. (That was very poetic, oh) The atmosphere is what always got me. For example, I think everyone remembers the first time they had to get to Galaxy News radio by travelling through the sewers. Now I will be the first to admit, I hate sewers. A lot, in games. Any underwater level or sewers, hate them too overused. However in Fallout, they were done just perfectly. They had a job to do, and that was to make the player dread going through them and also scare the player with how dark and worn down they were. Not to mention the obvious ghouls which lurked in the sewers. I still remember going through them with melee weapons as I liked to use them most and regretting it as it meant I had to get up close and personal with them. However I loved it. I'd sneak around the sewers silently hoping I wasn't spotted and if I was. Prepare for a battle. But in that moment when fear and adrenaline kick in. You know it is good. You're in a state of panic and power. You stand your ground like the Vault Boy/Girl hero you are! 

Another one of my favorite building in Fallout 3 is the Dunwich building. Oh my, now that was a creepy place. I won't spoil much but go [here on your Pip Boy](http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13659/844460-dunwich_building_loc.jpg) if you haven't and just, enjoy it. The place is captured brilliantly, it sets out and achieves what it has to and for me anyway, did a brilliant job.

As for the older games, the [music is what did it there for me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGyB093QOIo&amp;ab_channel=F4m1LyGuy10). The music felt dark, metallic and hopeless. It felt like you were along, isolated and in a world where everything set out to kill you. Which it did but if you just close your eyes, it will take you away. To a world where you're alone and fighting for your life. Meeting strange characters along your way. Maybe they try to kill you maybe they don't, maybe you kill them. All you have to do is close your eyes when listening to it or playing Fallout and you'll know what I mean. It just gets your mind going. 

The isometric view really doe it for me too though in older games. One thing I love about older games is the isomeric top down view on the world. I don't know why but I feel as though it can tell much more story than some games today with their 3D views. But that's a whole other story.
____________________________________________________________________________
**What happens in New Vegas, stays in New Vegas...**

Which leads me onto the next topic I want to talk about. LORE! I do love me some lore in my games. Any by some lore, I mean a lot of lore. And by some of my games, I mean all of my games. I love to play games that have lore. But not silly lore such as Timmy killed the dog and you can find the dog in the garden and a knife beside Timmy's skeleton. I mean lore that makes the world feel not only alive after it has died. But dead while also making it feel like it was once lived in. And honestly, there is no better game than Fallout 3 to do such a job.

I feel as though the developers felt that in order to make a dead world feel alive they needed to add loads of small details into the game. Which is exactly what they did indeed. Walking around in the game you will find small items or logs scattered, saying something about the world at the time the author was alive. Such as a daughter complaining about her father being out in radiation too long after the bombs fell onto for the player to stumble upon him later in the game at his last know location. Or while looting a house, you find a cut-throat blade beside a skeleton in a bathtub surrounded by injections that are empty. Or two [skeletons hugging](http://i.imgur.com/yW0lWYL.jpg) each other on a double bed. Were they alive when the bombs feel and just lost hope? Were they asleep? What happened them, why did they do it? You're left with so many questions about these dead people that might be written in a diary around the house or logged on a computer somewhere. 

To me it is the smaller things that all add up to make a massive game. The thought of being able to go into any house and be surprised about what small bits of story lay beyond that door. Will it be a child's room that is unfinished. A rusty robot that still thinks it is before the bombs fell. These are all the things you can expect in the Fallout games. And I have no doubt and also look forward to the new small stories which we will be left to discover in Fallout 4. No doubt the developers gave only improved and learned that the est way to make something big, is to take a tong a small steps.

Just to add too the companions all have interesting backstories too. Not many people remember the companions when playing through the game. I know I often forgot about one or two of them like Raul or Veronica. But they have interesting stories which you learn as you travel with them and get to know them. Some of the moments are very sad and some moments you even get to meet certain people from their pasts. Which is also very nice, makes the characters matter and put them in their place in the world full of disorder and chaos.
____________________________________________________________________________
**Travelling beyond the boarders...**

When you nearly reach the end of your journey in the wasteland though there is always further adventure waiting beyond the boarder. The DLC's which were made not only for Fallout 3 but also for Fallout New Vegas were amazing. While Point Lookout was buggy more than any of the other previous DLC's I can not argue it was probably filled with the best lore in all of Fallout 3's DLC's. It was interesting fresh, the atmosphere stank of swamp but it got it right. It was interesting, scary, atmospheric. It even had quests which connected back into the mainland. (Yes I am looking at you Dunwich building. ^wink ^^wink) It gave us back story into before the war, it showed us relations between the Chinese and US at the time. It gave us a whole new area to explore and investigate and feel.

In New Vegas we got to go to the Sierra Madre Casino. Which is by far my favorite DLC in the Fallout franchise. Once again it, it just did everything right. We got lore, atmosphere,  backstory from people and even connected it back to the main Mojave Wasteland too once again. (Yes I am looking at you specific companion we can play with! ^wink ^^wink ^^^wink) It all just makes me excited to see what we can expect from DLC that could possible come along with Fallout 4. After all, if past experience is anything to go by with the Fallout franchise it is that they appear to get better and better with each one. Not without their kinks of course but they get ironed out and fixed. All in all, looking into the future of the Fallout franchise I have nothing but pure excitement to see what else is being cooked up for Fallout 4. In terms of both mods and official DLC!

And speaking of mods, this is where Fallout truly shines! [Mooooooddssss](http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/?) and [Mooooooorree mooodddsss!](http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/?) Fallout's modding community has always been amazing. I mean just look at some of the mods that have been created. The time, effort all of which is done by people who do this as a hobby is astonishing. I always praise people for work well done and give credit where it is due always! And here, here it truly is. Looking back at Fallout 3 and New Vegas vanilla, I loved them. I did, but with mods. Of boy, things get much much more enjoyable. Realistic damage, more companions, more clothes, guns, quests, maps! The list goes on and on. Bug fixes, patches, new HUD's, hunger and health mods. New monsters. All of which have been crafted by a modder from scratch. I mean where can you not praise them.

My favorite mods would have to be the ambient ones though. The ones that changes the lighting and look of the game. Not graphics wise but more aesthetics wise. I love my games to have realistic lighting. For both day and night. New weather effects, ambient noises. All of these things I use in my games to only enhance the immersion of the game. Because when I play a game, I want to get sucked into it's world. I want to be able to experience the fear and isolation the game has to offer and is intended to give.

With all of these things in mind, people have already started planning their mods for Fallout 4 and this only makes me a million times more hyped than it ever did. Never have I been hyped for a game so much as I am for Fallout 4. The ambition and anticipation that is awaiting this game is palpable. I think once it arrives people are going to be flooded with Youtube videos and guides, mods and what have you of it. That is also a reason I'd like to get it, to be able to experience it myself before it all gets spoiled and ruins the initial surprise of it all. The upcoming flood that is going to happen will only enhance the modding community and give them a bigger initial boost to achieve what they want to with their mods. And that is what look forward too. The period when everyone will be researching the game to see how it will be to mod then the tools will come and everyone will start the race for the best mod.

Some of the best mods for Fallout 3 and New Vegas in terms of game play would have to be the base building mods though. The ones where you make a settlement and recruit people to go scavenging for you and get supplies and protect your town from invaders and raiders. Well, let's just say they are probably not my favorite mods as it leads me to my next topic.
____________________________________________________________________________
**The final destination...**

So we have been in the wastelands, ventured beyond it and now we arrive anew at our destination. So what do we do now, what's our goal? Well we settle of course! Yes, you heard me we settle. In Fallout 4, probably one of my most anticipated features to the game will be the ability to settle and make a settlement of my own. What they have done is gone and made one of the most popular mods and integrated it into the game. With a few added extras, consoles, lights, wiring, building. It will all be possible from day one in Fallout 4. Now it won't be able to be done anywhere from what I gather and have read. it will be in select areas but that is fine. No in fact, it is awesome!

We are going to be able to go and look for our ideal base within the game and settle there and make a home. But do whatever we want with it. We will have full control over how our home looks and feels to us. Which is amazing. The best thing about the mods in Fallout were you were able to make your own settlement but they were always a little buggy as to be expected because the game wasn't made for such things. But with a game that is designed for such a feature and could possibly be unlocked with modding. Now that is true excitement right there.It is what I am waiting for. I will be able to make my print on the Fallout universe as I build my own settlement and help it grow and prosper. If you look at the video I posted back at the top you will see it at the 23:15 mark.

It gives a feeling that the wasteland is no longer dead. The wasteland isn't lying down and taking it anymore. They are on their way back up. The people were kicked down and most of them beaten and killed but now it is time for a change and that is what Fallout 4 seems to be telling us. No longer will the inhabitants of the wasteland have to suffer. But it is time to take back what was taken from them. Or at least that is the vibe I am getting and I am sticking with it and love it. The feeling of not being a sole traveler anymore in Fallout is a new fresh welcome idea. That you are no longer forced to be alone that you can now grow a community. Not only that but the other major feature that will be coming with Fallout 4 is the customization.

Now, I do love the ability to customize my set up and gear in games. I like to be able to choose my armor and put it on piece by piece. But what is going to happen in Fallout 4 is taking me back years to when games allowed much more customization than that of which most games allow today. If you watch the video I posted back at the very top of the request you'll see exactly what I mean. At about the 26:20 mark that is. 

This level of customization is something I haven't seen for a long time in games. Or at least not in a Fallout game yet. Like it was said, the developers have gone all out and the only thing they can do is go up because depth and complexity is always a welcome feature in games in my books. It gives the players the tools to explore options for themselves and gives not only random items in the world a use it also makes them useful for keeping and not selling to make a quick bottle cap. All in all, it is looking like it is shaping up to be a fresh outlook on the Fallout franchise. With a voiced player character for the first time ever, to new power armor mechanics. It really does look like the developer's stepped back and thought how to make Fallout 4, not a rinse repeat game but more of a new game but still keeping the atmosphere setting and feel for the game everyone knows and either hates or loves.
____________________________________________________________________________
**A few years later...**

After playing Fallout for years and being constantly provided with high quality writing and gameplay. I think it is safe for myself to presume that Fallout 4 will be a fantastic game. Looking at all the leaked gameplay, official gameplay, reading on the Fallout subreddit. I think everyone is not only excited but also feeling the same with regards to how they think it will turn out. I am nervous, excited, scared but I am sure they will deliver on everything that they have set out to achieve. From what I am seeing all I can see is promise. 

Looking into the past and seeing what they have achieved. The foundation that Fallout was build on and how they have grown it. It just goes to show how much they as developers care and wants to make this game as great as they possibly can, not only for the fans but being gamers themselves it just goes to show the love they are putting into it and it makes me very happy and excited to see this. All too often we see developers just making games like drones just so the big guy can make some money. But I do think they are listening and taking in everything the fans want and in some form making it happen. 

Also is anyone else excited to see the world before the bombs dropped. I made a suggestion on the forums years and years ago, but I can't find the link to link it here sadly. Now I am not saying this is thanks to me because it obviously isn't but I think the fan-base as a whole have helped influence the decision for the developers to take this route and make the game start off before the war. And this is one element of the story I am looking forward to. Along with the android. I really wanted to see them expanded upon after the Fallout 3 mission at Rivet City.

So to begin to wrap things up, I will just say what getting Fallout 4 would mean to me. First off, I know it is a lot to ask. But it would mean an awful lot to me to be gifted Fallout 4 by someone. Just to be able to experience the game along with the initial wave of people and not have it spoiled like every other game nowadays.Being able to hop back into the wasteland and explore the landscape, investigate everything to death and find all the lore I can. be able to immerse myself in the atmosphere and help the wasteland grow and make a come back at the raiders and show them where we stand. Being able to experience the terror that I experience when I first played all the other Fallout's. being too scared to enter and area because it was too difficult or above my level range.

All of these things are what I look forward to in Fallout 4. Learning how to survive and adapt again in such a inhospitable place. Learning how it has changed people and how people resist the change. The game at times can feel much more like a game when done right and I think the Fallout series is one of such games that do it and do it right. It hits you hard and rough and does hold back. It is dark and unforgivable and knows it. And it is up to you to survive it. Plus [how can you not get hyped when you hear the epic Fallout 4 theme song.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzvZE4BY0hY&amp;ab_channel=BendikJacobsson) When a game or movie has a good soundtrack, I can appreciate it a lot. And this just happened to give me goosebumps every time. It's dramatic, dark, serious and gives a sense of epic adventure that lies ahead. I think it is well going to be worth the wait until Fallout 4 arrives.

I have been intentionally avoiding all articles, videos everything related to Fallout 4 besides official videos as I do not wish to know the maps size or details of the plot. I wish for this to be the first and greatest Fallout I am going to discover on my own and I shall await it like I did Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas. With hope that this will be the best one yet and oh boy, is it looking good!
____________________________________________________________________________
**War, war never changes...**

So, as you might have guessed this is my second time requesting the game. My [first request can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/3nusqk/requeststeam_fallout_4_23_off_on_gmg/) from about two weeks ago now.
 As you can see I did copy and paste but added a few more bits to the request however only because of the effort I put into this request. I wanted to add more involving my experiences with Fallout however I did not in fear of going off the beaten track. If asked however I would be more than willing go give an in-depth reasoning as to why I love the Fallout Franchise. More than willing as I know the game is very expensive and I expect to give a person who is willing to gift me the my the highest amount of knowledge and interest and show them how enthusiastic about the game I am. I know and respect the investment here that someone would be willing to make. Which is exactly why I'd be more than willing to prove to them that it would not be wasted.
_______________________________________________________________________
**The reason I can not buy the game myself?**

The reason I can not purchase the game for myself is not because of any sob story but simply put, I had an unpaid internship position and all my expenses were put towards that and travel as it was far away from where I currently live. I did not receive aid of any kind and I had to put my money into that. And now that I am finished, I am in the process of looking for a job however where I live (in a very small town) there are none. So right now for the moment I am stuck with the ever looming release of Fallout 4 and little money to purchase it. I do not expect or want pity as this is not a sob story. It's just life.

I have however entered quite a few giveaways in hope of winning the game however the RNG gods are not on my side sadly and with the game so close to release I feel as though I might miss out on going back to the wasteland and fear spoilers and such as there is be a flood of Fallout related content in the weeks to come before and definitely after the release..
______________________________________________________________________
**Where can I learn more about Fallout and where do I start?**

Well if you want to start your epic adventures through the wasteland there is no better place to start than the [Fallout Wiki.](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout_Wiki) From here you can read about all the lore of the Fallout's, from Fallout 1 - 4. Even some unreleased Fallout games. I would also recommend you to start with Fallout 1. Don't let the ancient look put you off. There are some mods to make it more HD for newer systems but they are still as good as the newer Fallout's. The lore, gameplay, choices. All make it a great experience. 

That being said you don't need to have played the original Fallout games to play the current ones. The only benefit will be you'll constantly be hearing references to events that happened in the original games which is great. Even meeting certain characters from your original adventures in the wasteland! After all these years I've been playing Fallout I have finished each one multiple times now and enjoyed them every moment. They are fun, challenging and original. They feel unique as a gaming experience and I'd recommend them to anyone.
_____________________________________________________________________

Thank you for once again reading my request. I know it is a big ask which is why I say don't be afraid to ask me questions about the game or my experiences with the game. I encourage it as I can understand if you want to get to know more about why I like the game and such. Still though, I hope my request was interesting and I look forward to one day hopefully seeing you in the wasteland. In a figurative sense of course as there is no multiplayer. :P

3pixcf,0,2015-10-20,I've hit a wall with C#. What direction should I go to kickstart my understanding?,SpaceNacho,csharp,https://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/3pixcf/ive_hit_a_wall_with_c_what_direction_should_i_go/,"I feel *so* lost trying to get through my C# class right now. I'm sure my problems are simply a psychological barrier at this point and I was hoping that people that know the language better than I do can help me break down these barriers a bit.

I went through an internship over the summer. My internship has been extended until I graduate and I've already accepted a full-time position as a developer at the company. Skill-wise, I understand programming concepts and logic pretty well, and I use PowerShell daily at my internship. I've learned enough on the job in PS that other teams have me figure out some things they need with it.

I'm not asking for anyone to do my homework, or even to sit down and help me get through it or something. I just thought I'd make this post on here to see if anyone can give me some tips that will help me to feel confident that I can start and finish this in a few days. It's not necessary for anyone to read the whole project description, I just wanted to add it in to give some context.

---

The overdue project I'm totally lost on is this:

a. Write a program named   DemoJobs   for Harold  ’  s Home Services. The programshould instantiate several   Job   objects and demonstrate their methods. The   Job  class contains four data fields  —  description (for example,   “  wash windows  ”  ), timein hours to complete (for example, 3.5), per-hour rate charged (for example,$25.00), and total fee (hourly rate times hours). Include properties to get and seteach field except the total fee  —  that field will be read-only, and its value iscalculated each time either the hourly fee or the number of hours is set.Overload the   +   operator so that two   Job  s can be added. The sum of two   Job  s isa new    Job   containing the descriptions of both original   Job  s (joined by    “  and  ”  ),the sum of the time in hours for the original   Job  s, and the average of the hourly rate for the original   Job  s.  
b. Harold has realized that his method for computing the fee for combined jobs isnot fair. For example, consider the following:  l   His fee for painting a house is $100 per hour. If a job takes 10 hours, heearns $1000.  l   His fee for dog walking is $10 per hour. If a job takes 1 hour, he earns $10.  l   If he combines the two jobs and works a total of 11 hours, he earns only theaverage rate of $55 per hour, or $605.Devise an improved, weighted method for calculating Harold  ’  s fees for combined  Job  s and include it in the overloaded   operator+()   method. Write a programnamed   DemoJobs2   that demonstrates all the methods in the class work correctly."

So I've recently been somewhat lucky during recruiting season and already have an offer. However, I'm not sure what to do with it. The offer is from a fortune 500 oil &amp; gas company and is for energy accountant internship. While I also have an office visit with protiviti this Friday that could also lead to an internship offer. 

I have to let the oil &amp; gas company know by Monday what my decision is. Therefore, I'm wondering if you guys have any insight on what I should do or what would be better for my future career. 

Is an industry internship a bad thing?
Is an internal audit internship/job a bad thing to start with?
Should I focus on trying to go into public?

I know that if I chose the energy internship I would earn an energy accounting certificate from my University but I'm also wondering if that will even matter in the long run. 

Further info about me: I'm in my 4th year at a public university trying to earn my 150 hours for CPA eligibility. I'll be graduating in Dec of 2016

Looking for any and all advice. Thanks in advance!"
3pj5af,6,2015-10-20,A little help here (First time poster),rockpaperscissors123,PLC,https://www.reddit.com/r/PLC/comments/3pj5af/a_little_help_here_first_time_poster/,"So before i start, i'd like to say that i'm not an expert in PLCs nor automation but i do have little advanced knowledge in PLCs and hardware. 

Anyways...lucky me got an internship in a company and was asked to modify a very complex machine's PLC program that has been programmed in IEC 61131 (Codesys). Not too bad yeah?

I open it up to see what PLC they have hooked up and it turns out to be a custom control unit from the machine's manufacturer connected to a CAN bus and a custom HMI panel. WTF do i do with that? And the program (400 pages of ladder and ST) they gave our firm on paper and disk magically (cough cough) have libraries missing....fml. 

So after reading the program and understand how everything works, I believe it is possible to connect an external PLC to the CAN IN/OUT ports, plus tweaking some sensors, to manipulate the tasks. 

My question is, what should i take care of when doing something as risky as this? 
Is this the best course of action?
Who the hell gives an intern this kind of responsibility? (i forgot to mention they have no expert in automation)

PLC experts help me out please...I got no where to turn

3pjxt3,26,2015-10-20,Rewatching first episode for the first time in 8 years.,mean1e,greysanatomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/greysanatomy/comments/3pjxt3/rewatching_first_episode_for_the_first_time_in_8/,"Holy crap! The feels! The humor! Everything's there. Right in the first episode. I never realized why I kept watching it for so many years until I realized the first episode was the one that clicked. It basically has everything in it. I mean, I love the series, every part of it, and now I see how people say how it got sort of darker each season. Everything's so bright and new. I'm so amazed. Even the music is just... so good. Reminds me how I actually googled the songs to get it into my playlist which I really don't do anymore recently since.. well.. yeah. most of you know the answer. 
I just can not believe it took me 8 years to rewatch it again, since I'm not really fond of rewatching since I know everything already but... this seems sort of new. EVERYONE seems so young. Like, literally, every one of them. Nothing compared to the newest season. So anyway, my point is, if no-one has rewatched it, I totally recommend. It's glorious, the old memories, the old awesome songs, everything! I sort of miss the new intern from the newest season, cause he's the fucking hottest guy in the whole series, but yeah, this is awesome and anyone who is sort of like me (doesn't like to rewatch because it gets dull) should totally rewatch at least the first episode, because that's where it began, that's where it got at least me hooked and holy crap, I feel like I'm loving this series even more.. although it has got annoying in some ways, but that first episode of the first season reminded me why I love those series as one. PLUS PLUS PLUS it's so freaking awesome to see how much those characters have involved those years and... the feels of almost 50% of them are gone. God, I am unsure if I can go through this again but I'm willing to take this step, so people give me your &lt;3 and I'll try this. It has just bring me so much laugh and also so much tears. I envy you all who actually had the courage to live through all those episodes again.. but eh, I'm about to be one of you. I hope."

I need to tell somebody. 
My life is so fucked up beyond any reasons. I'm almost 24 and have no degree or anything. No work experience, just some internships. I wanted to be a vet assistant so bad but had to quit in my third years because i couldn't afford the traveling by train anymore. My mom was in debt. So we ran. My mom pretended for a long while that everything was alright. My boyfriend still remembers the happy days. the happy me. He still waits for that person to come back but she's gone. 
 I fucked up his life too. So so much and the pain and regret is killing me. He's the sweetest guy ever and my first boyfriend, we've been together 4 years. He gave up everything for me. He works his ass off for me and i can't do shit. The stress was so much that i got sick. I couldn't eat. Lost 35kg. I used to be kinda chubby but now i'm just skin and hipbones. He fell for a chubby happy girl who had her shit together and now i'm depressed, fragile, sick all the time, stressed as fuck, paranoid and just crying all the time. I got so sick it felt like i was dying but i couldn't go to the hospital because i'm in debt too now. healthcare, studieloans from 3 years ago and other stuff. My mom fucked up my life. She made me get student loans so she could pay bills but i couldn't pay my room rent anymore. She made us pack everything up and just move to somewhere else. And now we just survive. I want to kill myself, let my boyfriend go live his life. The only reason i'm still alive is for my little brother. I can't do it to him. He's already failing in school because of all our shit. I can't give him a fucking trauma he's 14. But i want to do it so bad. i don't know how yet. Can't get sleepingpills or anything, guns are illegal here and i pass out if i see my own blood (only my own blood not animal blood) so knives and such aren't an option if i want to do it right. I'm really tall so hanging is difficult. No thick woods here either.  There has to come a miracle or something soon or i'm done with living. The thoughts of kids and the happy life are almost completely dark, nonexistent. I just want this to be over. No family. No friends left. Mom gave up. And i can't hold on anymore. I can't fix it anymore.

3pkna6,3,2015-10-20,[REQUEST][STEAM] Fallout 4,Ashesh3,GiftsOfGaben,https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftsOfGaben/comments/3pkna6/requeststeam_fallout_4/,"Version 2 new and improved!
Leaving the Vault...
Hey everyone /u/Ashesh3 here and today as you can guess from the name of the titles I will be requesting Fallout 4 here.


Important! Now before we begin I just want to comment about pre-ordering! Okay, I know some people are against it and some people don't care about it. I understand both sides completely and can see how both make their points. All I am going to say is if you are unwilling to purchase the game as a pre-order as a gift, that is fine. I respect that completely. However if someone was willing to buy the game for me a few weeks after it has been released, I will be more than happy to accept and wait even longer if something like this was to happen. I understand the some people hate pre-orders as some think it devalues or otherwise causes the game companies to become lazy and launch their game as fast as they can without bug fixes and the such only to upset the masses. However I thought I would still request while the waters seem pretty tame here for now and while the decent requests don't get flooded with the low attempt ones.


This time around though I thought I would up the ante to include pictures, stories about why I love the Fallout franchise all the way from Fallout 1 -&gt; New Vegas. So let's get this started.
Leading up to the war...
So I am not sure if any of you remember but back before Fallout 4 was announced years ago there were rumors that it was in the making. You'd see and hear whispers on the internet about how some research was being done in Boston and how it would be set there, however nobody believed this. Or at least I didn't. That was until the infamous countdown appeared a long time later. This is the site here for anyone interested. It isn't anything anymore though. But this is when the hype got real, well sort of. I wouldn't admit it to myself as it seemed suspicious that a game would be announced like this. However I was intrigued at the idea and watched the clock count down, albeit a little cautious.

I can still remember the night I watched it tick to zero and then the feeling. I think everyone just face palmed while the people behind it laughed their asses off. I must admit, it was good. They managed to trick just about everyone. It's just a shame Bethesda never spoke up or debunked it before it happened. I guess they wanted to see what happened in the end, just like everyone else who was following along with it. However after having my dreams of another Fallout dashed and shattered.(Not really, but I was pretty sad for a few days) I returned to normal life, accepting I wasn't going to be getting another Fallout anytime soon. After that I felt a little skeptic to everything I heard relating to Fallout 4 believing nothing I heard and just waiting for official news from an actual official, such a a developer. That day then came..


When the bombs fell...
And so it happened. The bomb had been dropped, the day had come. We were getting Fallout 4. After it was announced I felt joy, I'd be returning to the wasteland once again. I felt happiness. I just felt everything a child feels when they wake up on Christmas day and seeing their presents under the tree that a big ol' man had dropped by the night before. Except I was excited to be able to blow that man up and then loot his unique outfit. It was great. We were finally getting Fallout 4.
During the presentation all I could do was try to get rid of my goosebumps. The music, it was amazing. I felt it, the concept art. The gameplay, the visuals, atmosphere. Everything. It was just amazing. I knew that it would be worth the wait. The new customization, the new building. The possibilities for it all to be expanded in the modding of the game. It was all looking like it was worth the wait. And not only that but they also released another game that night. Fallout Shelter. I sat by my iPad that night. Refreshing and refreshing over and over waiting to download it as soon as it was released. In the end I had to go to sleep as it was very late but that morning I woke up, I got it, played it and loved it. It was the ultimate gift. A free mobile game to go along with possibly one of my most anticipated games ever. And it was coming so so soon...


And so the smoke settles...
And so the smoke of the announcement had settled. I accepted what had happened and began to get hyped and looking forward of what was to come. I revisited my old Fallout games. Of which I own: (Time does not represent actual time I have spent in the game. Trust me, I have played both on console too for countless hours and in Steam on offline mode. The very reason I actually joined Steam is actually because I had to in order to play New Vegas back when it was released. My very first game registered on it was in fact, Fallout New Vegas. Back then I did not have internet so I had no choice but to play in offline mode and the same goes for Fallout 3 GOTY which is why my time counters are very low.)
1: Two copies of Fallout 1. One in physical form part of the trilogy and the other on GoG.com.
2: One copy of Fallout 2. One physical (I did have 3 but I gave one to a friend as a gift for his birthday)
3: One Fallout Tactics, Part of the trilogy physical form.
4: One Fallout 3 GOTY, Steam.
5: Two Fallout New Vegas GOTY, physical PC, physical XBOX 360 and on Steam
I actually came across Fallout 2 and 1 by chance too. One day I was in a regular shop buying some milk. It wasn't in my hometown, but I was on my way home. When I arrived at the counter I noticed they had a small box of PC games all of which for €2. I looked in it and saw Fallout 2 and I thought why the hell not. Sealed, brand new. I thought where could I go wrong so I bought it went home and fell in love.
The game, while it did feel old felt like it didn't hold back. Back in a day where anything could go in games. One thing I remember in Fallout 3 was trying to kill the little boy and girl in Megaton because they were so annoying but sadly was not allowed. Well in Fallout 2, you could waltz into town and aim your mini-gun and blast anyone and everyone away. Including the little beggar thief children or stranger you see. It felt like making a mistake in the game mattered through your choices.
Also, your intelligence was a major thing in the older games too. If you choose super low intelligence, the game was completely different. If you had 1 intelligence you'd be very very dumb in game and it would show so in the gameplay chatting screen.Obviously this limited you in major ways as you were very stupid and unable to do many quests because of this but it is amazing that the developers even went to these lengths to allow something like this to even happen in the first place.


What makes you wish for a nuclear winter?
Travelling the Mojave of course. But seriously, the thing I love about the Fallout games is the atmosphere. The feeling of loss. The feeling of dread, death and no hope. The feeling that everything that was is now gone and buried under a mountain of bodies and a sea of blood. (That was very poetic, oh) The atmosphere is what always got me. For example, I think everyone remembers the first time they had to get to Galaxy News radio by travelling through the sewers. Now I will be the first to admit, I hate sewers. A lot, in games. Any underwater level or sewers, hate them too overused. However in Fallout, they were done just perfectly. They had a job to do, and that was to make the player dread going through them and also scare the player with how dark and worn down they were. Not to mention the obvious ghouls which lurked in the sewers. I still remember going through them with melee weapons as I liked to use them most and regretting it as it meant I had to get up close and personal with them. However I loved it. I'd sneak around the sewers silently hoping I wasn't spotted and if I was. Prepare for a battle. But in that moment when fear and adrenaline kick in. You know it is good. You're in a state of panic and power. You stand your ground like the Vault Boy/Girl hero you are!
Another one of my favorite building in Fallout 3 is the Dunwich building. Oh my, now that was a creepy place. I won't spoil much but go here on your Pip Boy if you haven't and just, enjoy it. The place is captured brilliantly, it sets out and achieves what it has to and for me anyway, did a brilliant job.
As for the older games, the music is what did it there for me. The music felt dark, metallic and hopeless. It felt like you were along, isolated and in a world where everything set out to kill you. Which it did but if you just close your eyes, it will take you away. To a world where you're alone and fighting for your life. Meeting strange characters along your way. Maybe they try to kill you maybe they don't, maybe you kill them. All you have to do is close your eyes when listening to it or playing Fallout and you'll know what I mean. It just gets your mind going.
The isometric view really doe it for me too though in older games. One thing I love about older games is the isomeric top down view on the world. I don't know why but I feel as though it can tell much more story than some games today with their 3D views. But that's a whole other story.


What happens in New Vegas, stays in New Vegas...
Which leads me onto the next topic I want to talk about. LORE! I do love me some lore in my games. Any by some lore, I mean a lot of lore. And by some of my games, I mean all of my games. I love to play games that have lore. But not silly lore such as Timmy killed the dog and you can find the dog in the garden and a knife beside Timmy's skeleton. I mean lore that makes the world feel not only alive after it has died. But dead while also making it feel like it was once lived in. And honestly, there is no better game than Fallout 3 to do such a job.
I feel as though the developers felt that in order to make a dead world feel alive they needed to add loads of small details into the game. Which is exactly what they did indeed. Walking around in the game you will find small items or logs scattered, saying something about the world at the time the author was alive. Such as a daughter complaining about her father being out in radiation too long after the bombs fell onto for the player to stumble upon him later in the game at his last know location. Or while looting a house, you find a cut-throat blade beside a skeleton in a bathtub surrounded by injections that are empty. Or two skeletons hugging each other on a double bed. Were they alive when the bombs feel and just lost hope? Were they asleep? What happened them, why did they do it? You're left with so many questions about these dead people that might be written in a diary around the house or logged on a computer somewhere.

To me it is the smaller things that all add up to make a massive game. The thought of being able to go into any house and be surprised about what small bits of story lay beyond that door. Will it be a child's room that is unfinished. A rusty robot that still thinks it is before the bombs fell. These are all the things you can expect in the Fallout games. And I have no doubt and also look forward to the new small stories which we will be left to discover in Fallout 4. No doubt the developers gave only improved and learned that the est way to make something big, is to take a tong a small steps.
Just to add too the companions all have interesting backstories too. Not many people remember the companions when playing through the game. I know I often forgot about one or two of them like Raul or Veronica. But they have interesting stories which you learn as you travel with them and get to know them. Some of the moments are very sad and some moments you even get to meet certain people from their pasts. Which is also very nice, makes the characters matter and put them in their place in the world full of disorder and chaos.
Travelling beyond the boarders...

When you nearly reach the end of your journey in the wasteland though there is always further adventure waiting beyond the boarder. The DLC's which were made not only for Fallout 3 but also for Fallout New Vegas were amazing. While Point Lookout was buggy more than any of the other previous DLC's I can not argue it was probably filled with the best lore in all of Fallout 3's DLC's. It was interesting fresh, the atmosphere stank of swamp but it got it right. It was interesting, scary, atmospheric. It even had quests which connected back into the mainland. (Yes I am looking at you Dunwich building. wink wink) It gave us back story into before the war, it showed us relations between the Chinese and US at the time. It gave us a whole new area to explore and investigate and feel.
In New Vegas we got to go to the Sierra Madre Casino. Which is by far my favorite DLC in the Fallout franchise. Once again it, it just did everything right. We got lore, atmosphere, backstory from people and even connected it back to the main Mojave Wasteland too once again. (Yes I am looking at you specific companion we can play with! wink wink wink) It all just makes me excited to see what we can expect from DLC that could possible come along with Fallout 4. After all, if past experience is anything to go by with the Fallout franchise it is that they appear to get better and better with each one. Not without their kinks of course but they get ironed out and fixed. All in all, looking into the future of the Fallout franchise I have nothing but pure excitement to see what else is being cooked up for Fallout 4. In terms of both mods and official DLC!

And speaking of mods, this is where Fallout truly shines! Mooooooddssss and Mooooooorree mooodddsss! Fallout's modding community has always been amazing. I mean just look at some of the mods that have been created. The time, effort all of which is done by people who do this as a hobby is astonishing. I always praise people for work well done and give credit where it is due always! And here, here it truly is. Looking back at Fallout 3 and New Vegas vanilla, I loved them. I did, but with mods. Of boy, things get much much more enjoyable. Realistic damage, more companions, more clothes, guns, quests, maps! The list goes on and on. Bug fixes, patches, new HUD's, hunger and health mods. New monsters. All of which have been crafted by a modder from scratch. I mean where can you not praise them.

My favorite mods would have to be the ambient ones though. The ones that changes the lighting and look of the game. Not graphics wise but more aesthetics wise. I love my games to have realistic lighting. For both day and night. New weather effects, ambient noises. All of these things I use in my games to only enhance the immersion of the game. Because when I play a game, I want to get sucked into it's world. I want to be able to experience the fear and isolation the game has to offer and is intended to give.o

With all of these things in mind, people have already started planning their mods for Fallout 4 and this only makes me a million times more hyped than it ever did. Never have I been hyped for a game so much as I am for Fallout 4. The ambition and anticipation that is awaiting this game is palpable. I think once it arrives people are going to be flooded with Youtube videos and guides, mods and what have you of it. That is also a reason I'd like to get it, to be able to experience it myself before it all gets spoiled and ruins the initial surprise of it all. The upcoming flood that is going to happen will only enhance the modding community and give them a bigger initial boost to achieve what they want to with their mods. And that is what look forward too. The period when everyone will be researching the game to see how it will be to mod then the tools will come and everyone will start the race for the best mod.
Some of the best mods for Fallout 3 and New Vegas in terms of game play would have to be the base building mods though. The ones where you make a settlement and recruit people to go scavenging for you and get supplies and protect your town from invaders and raiders. Well, let's just say they are probably not my favorite mods as it leads me to my next topic.


The final destination...
So we have been in the wastelands, ventured beyond it and now we arrive anew at our destination. So what do we do now, what's our goal? Well we settle of course! Yes, you heard me we settle. In Fallout 4, probably one of my most anticipated features to the game will be the ability to settle and make a settlement of my own. What they have done is gone and made one of the most popular mods and integrated it into the game. With a few added extras, consoles, lights, wiring, building. It will all be possible from day one in Fallout 4. Now it won't be able to be done anywhere from what I gather and have read. it will be in select areas but that is fine. No in fact, it is awesome!


We are going to be able to go and look for our ideal base within the game and settle there and make a home. But do whatever we want with it. We will have full control over how our home looks and feels to us. Which is amazing. The best thing about the mods in Fallout were you were able to make your own settlement but they were always a little buggy as to be expected because the game wasn't made for such things. But with a game that is designed for such a feature and could possibly be unlocked with modding. Now that is true excitement right there.It is what I am waiting for. I will be able to make my print on the Fallout universe as I build my own settlement and help it grow and prosper. If you look at the video I posted back at the top you will see it at the 23:15 mark.
It gives a feeling that the wasteland is no longer dead. The wasteland isn't lying down and taking it anymore. They are on their way back up. The people were kicked down and most of them beaten and killed but now it is time for a change and that is what Fallout 4 seems to be telling us. No longer will the inhabitants of the wasteland have to suffer. But it is time to take back what was taken from them. Or at least that is the vibe I am getting and I am sticking with it and love it. The feeling of not being a sole traveler anymore in Fallout is a new fresh welcome idea. That you are no longer forced to be alone that you can now grow a community. Not only that but the other major feature that will be coming with Fallout 4 is the customization.

Now, I do love the ability to customize my set up and gear in games. I like to be able to choose my armor and put it on piece by piece. But what is going to happen in Fallout 4 is taking me back years to when games allowed much more customization than that of which most games allow today. If you watch the video I posted back at the very top of the request you'll see exactly what I mean. At about the 26:20 mark that is.
This level of customization is something I haven't seen for a long time in games. Or at least not in a Fallout game yet. Like it was said, the developers have gone all out and the only thing they can do is go up because depth and complexity is always a welcome feature in games in my books. It gives the players the tools to explore options for themselves and gives not only random items in the world a use it also makes them useful for keeping and not selling to make a quick bottle cap. All in all, it is looking like it is shaping up to be a fresh outlook on the Fallout franchise. With a voiced player character for the first time ever, to new power armor mechanics. It really does look like the developer's stepped back and thought how to make Fallout 4, not a rinse repeat game but more of a new game but still keeping the atmosphere setting and feel for the game everyone knows and either hates or loves.
A few years later...

After playing Fallout for years and being constantly provided with high quality writing and gameplay. I think it is safe for myself to presume that Fallout 4 will be a fantastic game. Looking at all the leaked gameplay, official gameplay, reading on the Fallout subreddit. I think everyone is not only excited but also feeling the same with regards to how they think it will turn out. I am nervous, excited, scared but I am sure they will deliver on everything that they have set out to achieve. From what I am seeing all I can see is promise.
Looking into the past and seeing what they have achieved. The foundation that Fallout was build on and how they have grown it. It just goes to show how much they as developers care and wants to make this game as great as they possibly can, not only for the fans but being gamers themselves it just goes to show the love they are putting into it and it makes me very happy and excited to see this. All too often we see developers just making games like drones just so the big guy can make some money. But I do think they are listening and taking in everything the fans want and in some form making it happen.

Also is anyone else excited to see the world before the bombs dropped. I made a suggestion on the forums years and years ago, but I can't find the link to link it here sadly. Now I am not saying this is thanks to me because it obviously isn't but I think the fan-base as a whole have helped influence the decision for the developers to take this route and make the game start off before the war. And this is one element of the story I am looking forward to. Along with the android. I really wanted to see them expanded upon after the Fallout 3 mission at Rivet City.
So to begin to wrap things up, I will just say what getting Fallout 4 would mean to me. First off, I know it is a lot to ask. But it would mean an awful lot to me to be gifted Fallout 4 by someone. Just to be able to experience the game along with the initial wave of people and not have it spoiled like every other game nowadays.Being able to hop back into the wasteland and explore the landscape, investigate everything to death and find all the lore I can. be able to immerse myself in the atmosphere and help the wasteland grow and make a come back at the raiders and show them where we stand. Being able to experience the terror that I experience when I first played all the other Fallout's. being too scared to enter and area because it was too difficult or above my level range.
All of these things are what I look forward to in Fallout 4. Learning how to survive and adapt again in such a inhospitable place. Learning how it has changed people and how people resist the change. The game at times can feel much more like a game when done right and I think the Fallout series is one of such games that do it and do it right. It hits you hard and rough and does hold back. It is dark and unforgivable and knows it. And it is up to you to survive it. Plus how can you not get hyped when you hear the epic Fallout 4 theme song. When a game or movie has a good soundtrack, I can appreciate it a lot. And this just happened to give me goosebumps every time. It's dramatic, dark, serious and gives a sense of epic adventure that lies ahead. I think it is well going to be worth the wait until Fallout 4 arrives.

I have been intentionally avoiding all articles, videos everything related to Fallout 4 besides official videos as I do not wish to know the maps size or details of the plot. I wish for this to be the first and greatest Fallout I am going to discover on my own and I shall await it like I did Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas. With hope that this will be the best one yet and oh boy, is it looking good!
War, war never changes...
So, as you might have guessed this is my second time requesting the game. My first request can be found here from about two weeks ago now. As you can see I did copy and paste but added a few more bits to the request however only because of the effort I put into this request. I wanted to add more involving my experiences with Fallout however I did not in fear of going off the beaten track. If asked however I would be more than willing go give an in-depth reasoning as to why I love the Fallout Franchise. More than willing as I know the game is very expensive and I expect to give a person who is willing to gift me the my the highest amount of knowledge and interest and show them how enthusiastic about the game I am. I know and respect the investment here that someone would be willing to make. Which is exactly why I'd be more than willing to prove to them that it would not be wasted.


The reason I can not buy the game myself?
The reason I can not purchase the game for myself is not because of any sob story but simply put, I had an unpaid internship position and all my expenses were put towards that and travel as it was far away from where I currently live. I did not receive aid of any kind and I had to put my money into that. And now that I am finished, I am in the process of looking for a job however where I live (in a very small town) there are none. So right now for the moment I am stuck with the ever looming release of Fallout 4 and little money to purchase it. I do not expect or want pity as this is not a sob story. It's just life.
I have however entered quite a few giveaways in hope of winning the game however the RNG gods are not on my side sadly and with the game so close to release I feel as though I might miss out on going back to the wasteland and fear spoilers and such as there is be a flood of Fallout related content in the weeks to come before and definitely after the release..


Where can I learn more about Fallout and where do I start?
Well if you want to start your epic adventures through the wasteland there is no better place to start than the Fallout Wiki. From here you can read about all the lore of the Fallout's, from Fallout 1 - 4. Even some unreleased Fallout games. I would also recommend you to start with Fallout 1. Don't let the ancient look put you off. There are some mods to make it more HD for newer systems but they are still as good as the newer Fallout's. The lore, gameplay, choices. All make it a great experience.
That being said you don't need to have played the original Fallout games to play the current ones. The only benefit will be you'll constantly be hearing references to events that happened in the original games which is great. Even meeting certain characters from your original adventures in the wasteland! After all these years I've been playing Fallout I have finished each one multiple times now and enjoyed them every moment. They are fun, challenging and original. They feel unique as a gaming experience and I'd recommend them to anyone.
Thank you for once again reading my request. I know it is a big ask which is why I say don't be afraid to ask me questions about the game or my experiences with the game. I encourage it as I can understand if you want to get to know more about why I like the game and such. Still though, I hope my request was interesting and I look forward to one day hopefully seeing you in the wasteland. In a figurative sense of course as there is no multiplayer. :P

3pkvwv,0,2015-10-20,Looking to enroll,ButtNuggets_McFlurry,WGU,https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/3pkvwv/looking_to_enroll/,"Hi.

I'm currently looking at enrolling in WGU, but I'm not sure if I'm quite right for the school. I could of course talk to the staff and mentors/advisers, but I thought it might be more enlightening to talk to students and maybe alumni. I'm on the fence between a BS in Information Technology Software and a BS in Software Development.

Since sophomore year of high school, I've been teaching myself different programming languages, OOP concepts, and the like. In my junior and senior years of high school I took classes towards a CCNA (but never got around to taking the test).

Last year, I was able to land an internship at a local engineering firm developing a parts management website.

Any thoughts on how I would fare at WGU or if I should attend at all?"
3pl50f,1,2015-10-20,Having the worst night of my life.,acutestress,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3pl50f/having_the_worst_night_of_my_life/,"Created this throwaway with my actual affliction in mind, I am going through an incredibly stressful time and I really don't feel like I'll come out on top. 

I am set to run out unemployment in a week or two's time, as far as I know I can't get an extension either. It has been a spat of unemployment for 6 months now. I have a promising internship that might turn into a job eventually but I am waiting for that to come through it opens up sporadically. I need that to come through, I'm trying to be exemplary but made a mistake with it last week and felt the wrath of it today, I felt completely and utterly defeated. 

The positions won't be open and I need to be in the position for most likely around 6 months, the unemployment is about to run out, I need to pay rent. My girlfriend is absolutely livid with me, I only have enough saved up to cover about 2 months expenses at the bare minimum. I only spend between 25-30 hours during the prime office hours at the internship. I need to find supplemental income, but don't want my internship performance to suffer. 

My work life balance is completely screwed. My girlfriend is telling me that she's going to be an insufferable roommate and that she's severely disappointed because of poorly I manged my unemployment, I was paying my portion of the bills while I could, specifically rent and groceries. She thinks I could have been more proactive, the past 6 months have been awful but she has been helpful/supportive where she can be. 

I feel like utter shit, because I should of had something by now. I've only been at this internship a month, I need to survive until about March before I can really feel comfortable with having a new job experience on my resume to draw from due to my gap in employment. A position might open up with the place I'm working in that time too. 

I'm freaked out, I've had issues in the past with my girlfriend regarding my ability to follow-through on promises I've made. I need to survive this but I can't go out and tell her what I'll do, she'll just think it's the same old song and dance. I feel like I'm getting crushed. I sometimes space out and just feel an immense weight because I can't think about anything but my imploding relationship and how I've fucked up what should have been a bright future. 

We were talking about getting married when I was at my last job. I feel like I put the nail in our coffin by moving in together. I'm just paralyzed. I know it's my fault and I want to own up to it, but I may have already screwed by getting to this point of running out of my safety net before I had a back up career or something part time to supplement and get me to be able to float by while keeping the internship. 

My girlfriend and I were just at the gym, on the drive over I tried to talk and tell her I don't want to be this burden she's stuck with, she said I was and stormed off to the gym from where we parked. I collected myself and went into the gym, we worked out and she left and texted me telling me she's just going to walk home. I have an anxiety attack and call her to see what's going on. She answers the phone and sounds numb. I can't stand that I feel like I'm causing all of this. 

She just walked in and we've basically been having an awful time since then. I don't even know where to pick up the pieces and feel like this vent was so jumbled. "

We have in the studio with us, fresh off his victory against Team Cypher, AAAAAAA, and his partner that was instrumental in victory, Rui.

""Good Evening, SinR.  I'm glad to finally be on your show.""

""Yeah, since AAAAAAA told me you reached out to him for an interview he hasn't shut up about being on the news.""

Yes, well, after the one thousand and first application to work here, I figure I'd throw you at least one bone, maybe this could turn into something for you, maybe an internship...

""REALLY?""

Maybe.  MAYBE.  By the way thank you for dealing with that Meowth for us.  Didn't realize it was actually a Shadow Pokemon that belonged to some lowly Cypher Peon.

""Thank Rui, she recognized it right away as a Shadow Pokemon""

""You're quite welcome, Mr. SinR""

Anyways, enough on the introductions.  AAAAAAA How are you feeling?  Most hosts seem drained after going for days on end with no sleep, but you managed to achieve The Run in a mere five days, our second shortest on record.  You, however, still seem to be full of energy and ready to go.

""Oh, its the 99 Awakenings I bought.  Turns out those things are pretty amazing for People, not just Pokemon.  One of these and its like ""ALRIGHTLETSFUCKINGGONOWGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGO"".  I feel great!""

Right... Rui what about you?  How do you feel?

""I'm a little tired, but all the time that he took in the Knockout challenges grinding the team I got LOTS of sleep in, so I'm glad for that.  Not so much towards the end of the run, since I had to be there for AAAAAAA in Realgem Tower.""

I trust you've had time to rest since then AAAAAAA defeated Evice?

""Yeah, I managed to get some sleep, but the time difference between Orre and here really gets to me.""

""Rui you GOTTA TRY one of these, I swear it'll make you feel like... ""OMFGAAAAAAALOOKTHERESLIKE3489583490SHADOWPOKEMONWEGOTTAPURIFY.""

""Yeah... no thanks.""

Anyway, back to the point.  AAAAAAA, how did you get started with Pokemon?

""Yeah, way back when I was a kid I got signed up to beta test some TV system Professor Oak was developing.  I started off watching the Pichu Brothers anime, then I met a Pikachu... and... his friends... and then...  and then...""

Yeah, I bet I know what happens next.  Anyways, Nacho and Scumbreon.  Personally I'm a HUGE fan of Eevee and their evolutions.  Where did you get them?

""WHY did they have to do it?""

Do you need a minute?

""Yes, Mr. SinR, he... he sometimes gets this way.  Some deep-seeded traumatic experience from when he was younger""

""THEY TOOK MY BEST FRIEND, MY PIKACHU!  MY... PIKACHU... poor AAAAAAA...""

""AK Love, can you hit him with some Sleep Powder please?  Thank you dear.""

Yeah... I'm sorry I brought that up, I didn't realize that was so traumatizing for him.

""He'll be fine, Mr. SinR.  just give him a little hit of that Awakening and he'll be back to his usual self.  He keeps a few in his trench coat for 'Emergencies'.""

OK... uh... AAAAAAA... are you...

""ALRIGHTLETSFUCKINGDOTHISSHITIMONSINRNEWSFINALLY!!!""

Well now... AAAAAAA you were just talking about Nacho and Scumbreon...  Where did you meet them?

""Yeah... yeah... Nacho and TACO.  Not SCUMBREON, TACO.""

I'm sorry, that's just the community's name for... Taco.  I apologize if it was offensive.

""Its OK.  Taco was just trying to make Nacho a bit tougher, and in the end it really worked out well for them.  I'm really proud of the way Nacho stepped up his game, and worked together with Taco against Nascour's Gardevoir.  Almost brings a tear to my eye.  Anyways, I met them when I was a teenager, found them wandering by themselves around Orre.  I eventually bonded with them and offered them both two Pokeballs my parents had given me when I was much much younger, and you know how Eevees evolve into Umbreon and Espeon.""

There are rumors that you snagged them from other trainers, given your... history... with Team Snagem, but I'm glad to see those rumors debunked.

""Yeah, Taco and Nacho have been with me since the start.  I know I did some bad things in Team Snagem, but I want to think that purifying the Shadow Pokemon helped redeem myself even just a little bit.  Everything balances out, you know.""

Right.  Rui, what about you?  Do you have any plans now that Cypher is defeated?

""Well, Mr. SinR, I would like to take some of the money from our successful run and invest it into replanting the Orre Region.  I mean, I was the Champion's partner, that might have a little pull, right?  Import some grass, maybe set up some oases in the desert where wild Pokemon can live.  It'd be great to return Orre to the lush landscapes from before the bombing... oh... dear...""

""WHY DID THEY HAVE TO BOMB ORRE?  THEY... THEY... THEY KILLED MY BEST FRIEND... MY LITTLE PIKACHU... AAAAAAA...""

*Sigh* ""AK Love, would you do the honors again?  Thank you dear.  You're a real life saver.""

Well, I actually have a few more questions for you.  Are you and AAAAAAA... you know...

""Well, we're not... ahem... 'Hatching us some Jelly Eggs'... if that's what you mean.  I mean, he's a nice guy when he's not all wired up on Awakenings... my grandparents approve of him, but I don't know if we can really have a serious relationship.  Maybe, maybe one day.""

""AAAAAAA... please... wake up AAAAAAA...  don't leave... me... alone...""

""AAAAAAA seems to be the name of his Pikachu... I can only guess why he named it after himself.  Maybe he went by a different name and took up AAAAAAA as his own after the bombing.  We'll never know.  Even MENTIONING the bombing seems to set him off... I am sorry for bringing it up Mr. SinR.""

Its quite alright.  We're almost out of time, Do you mind waking him up, I have a final question I want to ask him

""Oh, of course, one second, Mr. SinR""

""ALRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHTLETSGOGOGOGO""

Ahem... AAAAAAA, do you have any plans now that you're champion of the Orre region?

""Well SinR what I want to do is ensure that something like this never happens again.  I plan on sealing away the Snag Machine in the hopes that it never has to be used again, for ANY reason.  I also plan on donating most of my winnings to Rui's cause in hopes of terraforming the Orre region to a verdant oasis again.  For the moment though I think I'll take a vacation, go relax somewhere quiet.  FAR away from The Voices""

AND THERE YOU HAVE IT!  THAT'S MY REPORT FROM THE SCENE!!

Thank you Meowth.  Well that does it for my interview with the Orre Champion, AAAAAAA and his partner Rui.  From all of us here at SinR News, May all your ELFs be Shiny and your IVs be 31.  Goodn-

""Mr. SinR, you are aware that the Generation 1 Pokemon can't have 31 IVs and can't be Shiny, right?""

GOODNIGHT."
3plsav,2,2015-10-21,"Soon-to-be newlyweds, having conflict about money and sex.",rtb212,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3plsav/soontobe_newlyweds_having_conflict_about_money/,"My fiancee and I are getting married in a couple months. We moved in together about 4-5 months ago; we're both 22.

First off, there's the money issue. I'm in graduate school, making $24k/year on a research assistant stipend. She started a job in August ($32k/year salary), and quit after 4 weeks because of the long hours (~70 hours/week). She just found 2 part-time jobs, but with those 2 jobs combined she'll only be making around $12k/year. Since she moved in in June, I've been paying for pretty much everything--rent, food, bills, etc. The only thing she's paid for is a) her hobbies, and b) her car insurance.

I had about $35k saved up (high school jobs, gifts, paid internships) by the time she moved in. Additionally, I had really cut down on my expenses such that I was still able to save a few hundred dollars every month on just my stipend. However, to cover both of our expenses, I'm about $750 in the hole every month. She spends quite a bit every month on new clothes, gets fast food (or at least suggests it) 4-5 days/week, and spends quite a bit on her hobbies. Additionally, she wants to move from an apartment into a house starting next year (probably an extra $200/month in rent), and wants to go to graduate school without getting a stipend for it. This would, quite literally, completely wipe out my entire life savings ($750/month in the hole for 24 months, plus $3k/semester for 4 semesters in tuition). On the one hand, I want to support her dreams, but on the other hand, I'm the one who has worked and saved for years and years to get that money! Overall, it just scares me that we're not on the same page regarding money as much as I thought we were.

The other issue is the sex...or lack thereof. When we first started dating, she had a sex drive even higher than mine! Over the next few years, hers went down a bit and we were both pretty happy with fooling around 2-3 times a week. When she moved in here, it was only about twice per month. Now, it's only happened once in the past 2+ months, and I've had to resort to watching porn any time she goes out somewhere. I still love her, of course, but sometimes it feels more like I'm living with a roommate than a fiancee.

Also...we haven't actually had sex. She has vaginismus, and we've tried unsuccessfully for 3+ years now. Her OBGYN has been less than helpful (""just have a glass of wine, you'll be fine!""), and no progress has been made at all.

I don't really know why I'm typing all of this up. I just feel like there's no one that I can talk to about this, and I hate feeling down all the time out of concern about money, and worrying about whether or not we'll be able to have sex on our wedding night, and whether our relationship will ever get back to where it was a year or two ago. We never used to argue, but now we argue on almost a daily basis. I don't know what to do."
3pm0b6,2,2015-10-21,Girlfriend [26 F] of 8 years going abroad. Relationship already strained and I [27 M] am worried we won't last.,Bananabreadblues,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3pm0b6/girlfriend_26_f_of_8_years_going_abroad/,"My girlfriend and I met in college and we've been dating ever since, totaling 8 years in all. The last couple of years have left us both dissatisfied with the relationship, mostly due to factors outside of our control.


After college she had no debt but I did, and so I decided to move back in with my parents so that I could throw most of my income into my student loans. She got an apartment in the city and became a real estate agent, but failed to gain traction for various reasons. After a couple of years she had hardly made any money, and was having to rely on assistance from her parents to pay her rent. Eventually they said that enough was enough and forced her to abandon her career choice or move back home with them. She got licensed in Wisconsin and moved back home. And because I didn't want to live in a different state, she proposed that I move in with her.


I didn't like the idea. I had a stable, though stressful job, and I hated the the idea of moving in with her parents. It's not that I don't like her parents, but I hate living with my own parents and I really didn't want to move in with her's. But I did, I ended up finding a decent job in her town and I moved in. It didn't make me happy, but it paid my loans.


A year passed, but my girlfriend was still not doing great with her real estate business. In the city she had trouble because of the high number of experienced agents who drowned her out, no one wanted to take a chance on a young inexperienced girl. In rural Wisconsin she had much less competition and numerous listings, the problem was that no one was buying. Houses could stay on the market for months or years because no one was moving out there. Her parents got frustrated again saying that this was never meant to be a long term arrangement, they encouraged her to quit real estate and for us both to find jobs in the city and move back there.


I quit my job first and moved back in with my parents hoping that it would be a temporary move. I'd get a job, find a nice place for us to rent and by that time she'd have finished up her remaining business and found other agents for any clients she still had. Her real estate license would run out at the end of August and at that point she'd call it quits and choose another career path, she gave it her best but she just wasn't making any money that way.


But she didn't quit. She decided to renew her license and closed on two transactions in early September, and since then she's taken on more clients. I was glad she was finally making some money but every month she'd take on more clients and delay moving back. She said that she couldn't find the sort of career she wanted in the city and started looking elsewhere.


She applied for a great job in Vegas on a whim, claiming that she'd have regretted it had she not applied. I can understand that, but I didn't know why she was looking for a job that would require us to move again. I told her I followed her to Wisconsin, and I wasn't going to follow her to Las Vegas. I wanted to plant down roots, to stay with a company for more than a year at a time, actually start accruing vacation days and building up seniority somewhere so that we could save up for a house and get our lives moving again. I thought that was the end of it.


But she really wants to travel. She studied abroad during college and she really wants to have that sort of experience again. She's not satisfied with her life here, not with her career options or her social life, and she wants the adventure and excitement of traveling. This line of thinking is not uncommon with Millennials, I understand. We want to see the world while we're young, we're sick of working mundane jobs where we never get ahead, and we long to forget about the crushing debt weighing heavily over us. And really, we're not married, don't have kids or a house. If she were going to do some traveling now is the time to do it. So it really shouldn't be a big deal if she applied for an internship in Peru. But things started unraveling at unbelievable speeds at that point. She applied for the job last week, had a phone interview with them on Friday and told me about all of this on Sunday. Today they called her with the job offer. She has until Sunday to accept or decline.


The internship would last from January through June, it's only six months. We've done that before when she studied abroad and we hated the distance. I know lots of people have made long distance relationships work, but I don't know any that enjoy it. It's a challenge, I've endured it once and I don't want to do it again. But she's worth it.


There's an added complication though. We talked about it on Sunday, but neither of us feels the spark anymore, the passion has gone out of our relationship. We both love each other, understand, respect and cherish one another but there are times when she feels more like a friend or a roommate than a partner. I feel like this is probably due to external stress, such as monetary problems and living with her folks, not to mention the physical distance when we're living in different states. I know that intimacy problems happen for lots of married couples, they just wake up one day and figure out they've lost something, but it's a problem that we can fix. We both want to fix it, neither of us wants to break up, but I'm not sure what I can do if she chooses to take the job in Peru.


I've held onto the idea for awhile now that if we could just settle into decent jobs and get a place for ourselves, without roommates or parents, that everything would sort itself out. And if it didn't, then at the end of our lease we'd both be able to admit to ourselves that we were roommates and not partners, and we'd both move on. And now, if she takes this job we're not going to have that chance.


I've decided that I don't want to stop her from accepting the job. I don't want her to go, but I don't want to create a scenario where she stays for me and resents me 30 years from now for preventing her from following her dreams while she was young. I know that her greatest fear is being forced to abandon her career and her passions and adopt some sort of soccer mom role and live only for her kids. That works for some people but not her, and I've promised her that will never happen if we have kids. I also think it's selfish of me to stand in the way of her goals, if she needs to do this to be happy then I want her to do it. If she stays for me then I'll be forever guilty of holding her back, and subconsciously she will resent me down the line.


So she's going to accept the job, I've accepted that. I'd be shocked at this point if she turned it down. And now I have to decide how to move forward. If she leaves at the end of December then I have about two months left with her, and I don't know what to do. I feel like there's an expiration date on our relationship. I want to believe that our relationship can endure the time apart but things are already strained and we never had time to fix the problem we've only now identified.


Realistically I don't think we'll last. And if we do, I'm worried that we'll have lost something that can't be replaced. It's not fair to ask me to wait for her. How do I know she won't get hired on after her internship and stay in Peru longer than six months? The same thing happened when she didn't move back from Wisconsin. How do I know she won't choose to leave again the next time she's dissatisfied with her life here? It really makes me feel devalued when traveling is more important than our relationship and the life we were planning together.


We're at a rough patch but neither of us wants to break up with the other, we both want to work through this. It just feels like external factors are forcing us apart. After months of living apart we've already gotten used to living without the other, I'm afraid that this trip is going to be more than we can take.


I don't know what to do. We've had a lengthy discussion, we've gone through everything logically and emotionally. We've discussed the possibility of breaking up and getting back together in a couple of years if we're both single. There is no blame between us, nothing the other person did wrong, nothing that one of us could do better. Just a fundamental difference in where we each find value, and I can't believe that after eight wonderful years that a small character trait is enough to create a gap that cannot be bridged. I'd love some advice. I'm hopeful that we can make it work, but at the same time I want to be realistic. I don't know what I should do.

I have great qualifications and love CS. I do not want to become a pro player, but I am looking for suggestions regarding jobs/positions within the scene that suit my qualifications.**   

My name is Mike and I am 22 years old. Up to now my life has been completely flawless, including a guarded childhood, as well as loving parents. I have completed my Bachelor’s Degree in management, focusing on Finance and Real Estate at one of the most renowned Business Schools in Germany within 3 years and graduated with decent grades. I used my time during semester breaks to complete internships in Investment Banking (often working 90-100 hours a week) and Business Development, only taking a total of maybe 3 weeks off in 3 years… as a student. 

Currently, I am a Senior Business Developer and Head of Recruiting for an Internet based company, which is growing at a rapid pace. I often interview people 10-15 years older than me and I constantly get positive feedback from everyone. I earn more than I can spend and more than the average middle-aged family in Germany. 

Damn what a dick, showing off about his cool life on reddit, right? Is he trying to make us feel shitty? Why is this on the CS:GO Subreddit? What is this about?

Well I am unhappy. I realised that until this very day, I did what I thought would make me happy. Aspiring a traditional career, earning tons of money and seeing eSports as one of my hobbies. Of course my parents influenced me but they never forced me/talked me into doing anything. I am writing this from my workplace because I am desperate, asking myself: What do I really love? The answer is eSports. 

At around the age of 12 I started playing WoW and I got really into it. I was addicted by the age of 14 and I am glad that by the age of 17 I finally managed to sell my account after reaching Gladiator status, in order to focus on my studies and my soon to be career. I also occasionally played CS:Source with some buddies during that time, which I soon gave up when I started studying. 

STILL NO CS:GO? Wait for it.
In November 2014 I started playing CS:GO after seeing a friend of mine playing at a high level (in hindsight being GE in 2014 is still pretty impressive). I played a lot, but not excessively, finishing my studies with ease. I kept playing afterwards and currently have around 670 hours. I know that I will never become a pro (currently between LEM and SMFC) but my dream is to work within this community. At the moment I play maybe 1-2 hours a day and after being addicted to a videogame before, playing 8-10 hours of WoW a day, I realised that I am not addicted to CS. I just love it. I spend hours watching almost every game when I get home or even at work. Tier 1, Tier 2, Asian teams… Everything. I read every post on this subreddit first thing in the morning when I get to work (I am usually the first in the office and my colleagues think I am super motivated, Kappa). I get super hyped when watching previews for Majors and think about taking days off just to watch every game next week in Cluj (Hell, I even thought about flying to Romania). I watch pretty much every video of every YouTuber in the community, because I simply enjoy it. 

What do I want to do? Aspire a career in eSports. Not as a professional player but as a… well that is the question. I looked through every vacancy on esportscareer.org and jobsinesports.com and I am really looking for some feedback and ideas on what I could do.

I have great academic qualifications, speak 3 languages fluently with great communicative/interpersonal and analytical skills. I am not super duper smart, but I would consider myself as street smart and as the “good with people” kinda guy. As I said before I don’t want to show off anything, I am asking for your help and your suggestions. Please don't hate.

Long time lurker, first time poster. So about 8 months ago I decided I wanted to get into real estate development. Short blurb about my background, I got my Masters in Public Admin with a concentration in urban planning with the goal of going into urban planning. I’m also 27.  Around the time I was getting ready to graduate I connected with a group of planner, architects, and community oriented small scale real estate developers. This group/ movement is basically a bunch of urban enthusiasts that want to improve their community and  realize that the traditional levers to positively affect change in a cities built environment are vastly underwhelming and take forever. They’ve all come to realize if you want to see your city become awesome and have awesome places in them, you should just build them yourself. So if there is an awesome little area of town thats just getting off the ground by there are all these small abandoned buildings holding it back and you keep saying to yourself “someone ought to build ____”, well maybe you are that person. In a very round about way, we’ve combined urban planning / community development and real estate investing into a social entrepreneurship model. 

Upon getting hooked up with this group and at the same time really getting turned onto the idea of being in business for myself (and finally finding a way to turn my passion into a viable business) because of reading various books (mainly rich dad poor dad) and seeing some of my other friends starting up their own businesses. Since then I’ve been consuming information about all aspects of real estate (new development, commercial, retail, residential rental, house flipping, etc.) from various sources (bigger pockets, books, podcasts, talking to other people, etc). Its something I want to pursue full steam. Ultimately I want to get into small to medium scale residential rental properties and smaller commercial retail rentals and maybe mixed use (both rehabbing older properties and new infill development/building).

I’ve decided that the first step too take would be house flipping for a few reasons. A little bit on my background, I have a decent sized trust fund thats over 100k but less than 180k, so capitol isn’t an issue. I’ve decided to start with flipping because I will most likely be moving to another state (for my wife’s job) in 18-20 months (doesn’t make much sense in way of buy and hold rental properties). Given my time line for moving its the highest return on investment in the shortest amount of time (I’m under no illusions that this is a get rich quick plan or an easy thing ). I plan to use the capitol I raise from flipping or two houses to get me started buy and hold properties when I settle in my next city. Also I think that given my goal of eventually getting into larger developments/ new infill development that house flipping will give me experience in a lot of the skills needed for that. My general plan is to obtain a property by the end of January 2016 and begin the rehab process.

So my dad has had some experience with real estate because back in the 90’s he had about 5 rental properties and he also rented his old restaurant building. At first my dad was very supportive of the idea (granted my original idea was to do buy and hold properties before I knew about my impending move). In the last three months my dad has flip flopped on this issue easily five times, and seems to have fallen down on the side of flipping houses.

His reasons and arguments are as follows:
1) I don’t have a full time job to fall back onto (I’ve done a lot of temporary positions, paid internships, and some other side work writing) along with my partners income pay to the bills.
2) He thinks both the national and local (Tampa Bay) housing markets are very fickle and about to get more fickle. He thinks I missed the boat on flipping, which to some degree is true this is no longer 2010 where you could buy barely distressed houses a dime a dozen.
3). I have no experience with flipping or real estate.  There are a lot uknowns essentially. Especially construction/handy man stuff. He thinks that contractors will take me for all I’m worth.
4) The move. He thinks that impending move will get in the way…even though its 18 months off.

My dad general advice is almost exactly what poor dad’s, from Rich Dad Poor Dad’s, advice was: get a good job, get a 401k / retirement plan, get good benefits, and invest in bonds/cds/stocks/ and other safe instruments . My dad is big into investing money and putting it to work for you just very conservative bets. 

So I’m under no illusion that flipping houses is easy. I understand that its a risky endeavor, but to make money you’ve got to take risks. I think that I’ve got a decent understanding of the risks involved and the process. I still have more I need to wrap my head around, but I’ve got a good foundation and I’m seriously starting to take steps to make this happen. So , am I crazy and my dad right or is this a case where I should go it on my own?

Edit: I will continue doing the job and college simultaneously (no intention of doing one and not the other). I will earn about 3000 a year in the part time job, excluding doing any other job during the summer

This is a collection of prompts I've written over the last few months that I wanted to dig back up and throw out there for one more round before I begin writing up some new stuff. If any of these almost tickles your fancy, I'd love to talk with you about what you have in mind for a RP. If you just so happen to stumble into my post history and find something, I'd love to play with any of the prompts I have previously posted! 

My usual rules apply with all of these prompts: **As long as you are willing to play a female role I will be accepting all partners** and **If you would like to add some specific kink, lets talk about what you would like to play with first**!

I love it when partners expand my horizons on here, so don't shy away because something sounds too odd. My usual hard limits are: blood, gore, pain, watersports, and scat. I'm fairly open outside of that!

The main kinks that will exist throughout this collection of prompts will be:**Bimbos, bimbofication, MILFs, Mind Control/Hypnosis, Heavy Cumplay, Blowjobs, Lingerie/Sexy Outfits, and Big Cocks**.

""I'm just worried that without any play time Wallace won't feel like he's part of the team anymore."" Valerie's position was one of a thoughtful mother. Her hands were extended towards me, her soft eyes begging me to agree while her head cocked slightly to the side. Her son, Wallace, was busy packing the car. He was quite the clown, and focused more on running around practice with his underwear pulled up over his bellybutton more than his drills. His coach smirked, knowing Valerie, the good soccer mom she was, was watching from the car. Regardless of his shortcomings he was still her precious angel and she was willing to go the extra mile for him just so he got to see a little playtime.

""Valerie, I'm willing to give Wallace a shot as soon as he steps up his game in practice."" The coach said, assuming the same begging position as Valerie had just given him. It wasn't as effective, her she sported her soccer mom tits that she had received last year as a Christmas present. The new perky 32E orbs were quite convincing as they bounced with her gesticulations and were almost begging the coach to relent as her cleavage was maximized as Valerie's arms crossed her chest. The coach's eyes may have only strayed for a second, but Valerie noticed. The fierce cougar pounced at the opportunity. A clever smirk crept across her mouth even though she was reaching for the oldest trick in the book.

""Oh, these?"" Valerie cooed at the young coach's far to eager eyes. She hadn't had a younger man in quite a while, and with all that youth and enthusiasm, she had no doubt this would be the most exciting way to get her son back on the starting squad. Her finger fell to her cleavage as she stepped towards coach. His hardening cock was easy to spot in his pants. ""Mmmm, thick."" Valerie though to herself, her lips humming.
""How 'bout these tonight, Wallace plays tomorrow. See you at the hotel,"" She paused, her tongue lingering at her lips and giving him a naughty wink. ""Coach."" She turned and walked back to the car, wiggling her too-fit-for-a-mom ass.


**Hypnotic Grocery Store Hookups**

She had promised herself that she wouldn't use hypnosis outside of a work setting. A hypnotherapist by day, lonely woman at night, she hadn't been with anyone in over a year. She was pleasantly attractive, wavy brown hair, kind eyes, and a shapely figure. Her work would end at around five and afterwards she would head to the grocery store about once a week. She often took twice as long as she needed to get the few things that would fill out her pantry because she would be lusting over every attractive body that walked through the doors. The local Whole Foods was seemingly where every attractive person in town magically appeared once she walked in.

There was this one time where this beautiful guy said ""Excuse me"" while reaching for plantain flour while in the gluten-free isle. She stuttered through a ""sorry"", her mind swimming with the dirtiest of thoughts as she watched his arm retract, exposing his wedding ring that she had missed previously. She snapped herself out of it right as her mind began to wander. She was only daydreaming for a moment, but in that brief moment she imagined his head nodding into his chest as his eyes closed, stripped of his conscious mind. Oh my, the things she could do with a body like that. She shook her own head, realizing that the man she had just fantasized about was now halfway down the aisle, leaving her staring at her own empty cart. 

She would only last until the next visit to the grocery store. He was just-out-of-college aged, handsome, and he slid into trance so easily by the eggs. They both paid, left the store, and, per her suggestion, he met her at her car. He slid under again, his obedience was perfect, and she had him get into the back seat of her car. His cock rose to her suggestion. She sucked and fucked his hypnotically controlled body into oblivion. When she had her fill, a simple snap of her fingers sent him wandering back to his own car. 


**Office Productivity at an All-Time High**

On any given day in the very near future thousands of beautiful women can be seen bustling between the towering office buildings of any major metropolis. The arrive just shortly before the men arrive to their workplaces to ready themselves for the day. These women are Productivity Assistants and are privately contracted by different businesses to bolster focus and industriousness within the workplace. Smaller businesses might have a few assistants at their disposal, larger corporations can have a much more personal ratio of assistants to workers.

Assistants usually had their own spaces to prepare themselves for the workday. Their early arrival allows them to properly do their hair and makeup. They are also provided a company wardrobe that is both massive and constantly adding new articles. Formal business attire for these girls is a complete outfit, from lingerie to outerwear.

Just before the men arrive, all the assistants line up by the doorway to greet the men on their way to work. The men's eyes often stray down their professional-but-plunging necklines that reveals a hint of lace, tight and naughty against tanned skin. The assistants always glow from the attention. It would not be long before they were as swamped with their work as the men.

*Mr. Emmerson slams a fist down onto the table just moments after he begins to open his spreadsheets. His coffee cup rattles, sprinkling a fan of manila folders on his desk. In an instant, a blonde assistant turns the corner into his cubicle. She was wearing a fitted jacket and a flowing white blouse that was perfectly tucked into a tight pencil skirt that hugged her thighs. The blouse had a severe shortage of buttons, and she was at least missing three, not that they were of any use. Her bust was incredible, and even during the most casual of glances, one could feel their eyes being slowly pulled down the rolling slope of her soft neckline to her breasts. Just barely visible above the final button was a hint of pink lace.*

*The assistant's eyes settled on him softly through her black-rimmed glasses. She parted her full lips,*

*""What's wrong, Mr. Emmerson? Are yesterday's files not on the company server?"" She cooed sweetly, stepping into the office and swinging her arms around Mr. Emmerson's chest.*

*""They let the fucking interns touch the file and now the equations aren't correct!"" Mr. Emmerson yelled in a huff, his face was turning puffy and his cheeks flushed red. His fists clenched.*

*""Now now, Mr. Emmerson,"" The assistant said softly as she got down on her knees in between Mr. Emmerson's legs. She slowly undid his zipper on his pants. His eyes immediately locked onto the soft lips of the blonde.*

*""I'm certain we can figure all this out and get right back to work."" She smiled at Mr. Emmerson, taking his cock out of his pants and holding the hardening shaft just inches away from her lips. His face flushed red, but for an entirely different reason. His closed fist relaxed the assistant's lips wrapped entirely around the head of his cock.*

The Productivity Assistants left just after the men finished their workday. After the final worker left the office, the assistants all filed back into their quarters in the office. All of them had been stripped of their business attire and most had removed some or all of their lingerie. There was cum everywhere. Every hole filled, every face, breast, and ass coated in cum. They all giggled at the sight of themselves in the mirrors, cum often still dripping off of faces and tits from final staff meetings, and last minute projects thrust onto workers. Some licked the last load off before retreating home to rest for tomorrow's workday.


**The Gentle Hypno-Mistress**

We had known each other for a long time, and this all began as a hobby. She was beautiful. Tall, wonderful 32GG breasts, a narrow waist, curvy ass, plump lips, soft, luscious hair that fell in slow waves and a seemingly endless supply of lingerie; I did anything she asked, and hypnosis came up. She wanted to take control in bed, but in the nicest way possible. She was always a little cumslut, but it seems she wanted more this time. I went under so easily and she made it feel so good. We had to continue.
Now we are here. She loves using me, allowing me to satisfy her cum fetish with earth shattering orgasms that shoot massive, pearly white loads of cum. I never got to complain (not that I really wanted too), she was just in charge, and that's all there was too it. I was waiting for her to be ready for the night. She always did love to tease me into trance with some sexy outfit.

My eyes instantly locked onto her womanly frame as she opened the door to our closet, sensuously hidden underneath black lace. I could already begin to feel my mind beginning to dull with each high-heeled step across the floor. My eyes drooped down to two 32 GG breasts bouncing towards me in slow motion. My eyes tracked each little movement. ""There's a good boy, just stare and sink."" A confident voice cooed from a pair of perfect red lips. The tits stopped just before my face, my entire body relaxed to paralysis. A soft hand grazed the zipper of my pants and began to pull down. ""Just keep staring, good boy."" A soft hand slid into my pants, feeling my cock. ""Hard for me."" From the sound of her voice, I could tell that the perfect red lips were smiling. Her fingers snapped, and my cock instantly rose.

*Congratulations for making it down here!*"
3pno5n,2,2015-10-21,My (21F) roommate (22F) of three months has been extremely rude and I'm getting fed up,KhaleesiK,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3pno5n/my_21f_roommate_22f_of_three_months_has_been/,"Backstory: so I signed a six month lease for an apartment in my college town because next semester I'm going to be moving back home for internship.  Since most of my friends had roommates and made housing plans before I chose to stop being an RA, my mom and I agreed that I should just use the apartment's roommate matching system.

So that's what I did. I ended up moving in with Kristina and Tammy.  They've known each other for a while, and Tammy is dating Kristina's brother.  I had no issue with either of them at the beginning of summer, and now things have been escalating to the point where I don't even want to live in my own apartment.

Kristina has been coming home around 3AM every morning, including weekdays, with the guy she's seeing as well as some of his friends.  They come in slamming doors and yelling with no regard to me or Tammy. I have asked several times that she's more respectful of the noise level.

However, last night, they came in and woke me up around 2:30AM and were yelling until around 4:30AM when I had to be at work at 8AM, and I let Kristina and Tammy know my work schedule in case anything happens.  I should also note I keep my bike inside because bikes in our apartment complex have been stolen recently and don't want to risk it.  I called out of work because I had a fever and when I went out to get juice and something to eat, I found that Kristina and her friends had poured out all of the glitter I had for a project, destroyed our blinds, used all of MY clean plates without cleaning up, and messed with my bike.

I don't mind people using my dishes if they're respectful and put them in the dishwasher, but they were covered in food and just left on the table when I know Kristina had clean dishes in the cabinet because I put them away yesterday when I got home from work.  I just don't know what to do because I am so tired of feeling disrespected in my own apartment, and I know there's nowhere I can move to and can't afford to break my lease.
   
And I don't know if I can talk to Tammy about it since they are so close and have grown up together. She's never said anything to me about it being a problem.

**tl;dr**: My roommate has been coming in at all hours waking me up before I have work or class and has been disrespecting my stuff. I don't know what my course of action should be at this point because I haven't gotten a full night's sleep in two weeks. What should I do?

**Clarification:** I have talked to Kristina about it in the past about being more respectful about the noise level, and that lasted about a week. But with my work and class schedule, I barely see her and if I do, it's in passing when I leave for work or she's leaving for work."

I'm currently an intern, finishing my bachelor degree and making a thesis about a given project. I will be finishing my project around the start of January, will be defending it against a jury at the end of January. My colleagues are amazing and they put me in the right direction to get on with it and make this project a success. 

I already know who is going to sit in that jury: the company leader of where i'm working, my colleague who's training me, a few other people on behalf of their company, a couple of teachers and my own lector. 

Now about my teacher: we never got along very well, my colleagues have met him and they don't too. He's extremely critical, has a huge ego and a very sharp mind. Even if i make this project to a success, I'm sure he could still twist words around so I'll feel like a complete failure and ruin my presentation. I still have plenty of time to finish the project and it will be a success, but i fear that my weak point is going to be that presentation in front of the jury. I really need help on this.

I have always been good at presenting in a situation where i know that the people around are all supporting me. Now there will be the worst person possible that's going to critique my project, i see that this might be a good thing as i will never know what kind of other people the jury will consist of.

The problem with me is the following: I can't think when I've prepared something for hours and someone just shoots at me and tells me I'm wrong, I have a hard time making my mind up. Even if i know that the majority of my work was a success, just 1 little fraction that's wrong or could've been better will completely mess me up.

Thanks in advance

3pp1nf,3,2015-10-21,F4M - The Law Firm. Multiple options!,KissMyAssPlease,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3pp1nf/f4m_the_law_firm_multiple_options/,"This will be a roleplay taking place in a law firm. It's heavily influenced by 'Suits' as I'm sure a few people will notice with my prompt. I would very much enjoy if you played the character with your personality. 

**1)** You're a newly hired lawyer who's been making great impressions on name partners, paralegals and the other lawyers in the firm. You're starting to get better cases and work alongside some of the respected members in the company. I'm the secretary that you see everyday as you come in. I bring you papers, mail and help with anything else you may require. There's a few ways we can play off this.

a) We don't get along at all. Our personalities don't mesh well and we don't play very nice with each other. Backhanded and sarcastic comments are our form of communication. While we may not click, there's still a level of attraction between the two of us that's undeniable. 

b) We've been dating secretly. We haven't disclosed our relationship as we thought it would be better off to keep our personal and professional lives separate. We try to get the most out of our long hours the best we can. Sneaking around, stealing kisses, some heavy make-out sessions in the file room and so on. We haven't had much time outside of work with how busy it's gotten and it's starting to become impossible to keep our hands off of each other at work.

c) We split up after dating. It didn't end on the best terms. Lots of on and off moments over the course of the year but there's still chemistry between us. Although we still bicker over the smallest issues, we're somewhat friendly to one another. That's until you start getting jealous at work after seeing me flirt with another employee. How much longer can you hold off before you feel the need to sink your thick cock into my pussy again?  How long until you show me how much I need you and how I'm supposed to be all yours?

**2)** The same scenario as 1 but I would play the role of a paralegal or intern. 

a) You're being forced to stay late after hours to work on a case. You have more than enough work on your desk and I offer to stay back and help you out. We have flirted plenty over the months but never went any further. With the two of us alone in a rather empty office, we find the work being brushed aside, enjoying one another's company along with the fact that we're in need of some stress relief. What better than a quick, hard fucking on top of the paper covered desk?

b) I'm the intern who's had a crush on you and doesn't hesitate to flirt with you at work. You may have a girlfriend in this scene but it doesn't stop me from hitting on you. You're stuck digging through old files in the file room for hours on end. I keep you company, making it obvious how much I want your attention. Whether it's through my light touches or how much more sexual I am around you than anyone else. Plus it doesn't help that I'm usually breaking dress code with my short skirts and my low cut tops when I'm throwing myself at you. 

**3)** Surprise, you're still playing a lawyer. Much like 1, but you're going to another law firm for a deposition/meeting. Not everyone is taking kindly to the sight of the new hot-shot lawyer in their firm. However, luckily for you, the secretary or intern can't keep their eyes off you or stop flirting. They're doing their job of making you feel comfortable and welcome. Maybe you need to sneak off for some fun with the risk of being caught 'behind enemy lines'. 

**4)** The exact same as 3 except you play as a bike messenger who comes around daily to drop off documents and packages. I can play as the secretary or intern you flirt with every day, or perhaps one you don't get along with for reasons we can come up with together. Either way, wouldn't it be fun for the well dressed gal to be caught getting fucked by the bike messenger? 

---

Please, please send me your big kinks and what you don't like. Don't give me your personal description. I have images in mind that inspired this roleplay and would love to use them as a reference. I know the write up for the scenes is a little vague and bleh but I needed to get this entire idea written out. If you're familiar with Suits and want to play the role of Mike, that's good with me, too!"

Cersei Lannister: I'd love to play a guard that she takes a liking to and is actually able to 'make' her do things that she wouldn't normally. She likes his assertiveness and the fact that he is unafraid to tell the queen to bend over like a common whore, or get on her knees and swallow no matter how little she cares to do so.

Daenerys: For her, I'd love to play someone that can take her away from her 'Queenly' state and make her feel like a dirty young girl again. Whether that's one of her closest bodyguards, a trusted adviser, or a soldier for her army..... or maybe she gives her body up as a prize to a much needed ally perhaps?

Shae: After all that she did? I just want to treat her like a whore at the whorehouse.... Is that so much to ask?

Others: Arya Stark, Catelyn Stark, Margaery Tyrell

---House of Lies---

Jeannie: Obvious one here, but I'd play almost anyone against her in some fashion. A new boyfriend that is truly her baby daddy... A past fling coming back in to her life and wooing her .... A booty call on a business trip that turns in to something slightly more serious.... Etc etc!

Monica: She needs a nice young stud to keep her busy, doesn't she? I'm thinking an intern that she tries to belittle and finally wants to ease a bit of tension and then realizes just how big of a boy he is ... and it draws her to him more and more even if they really don't get along on a personal level.

Others: April, Sarah Guggenheim, Marisa McClintock, Brynn

---The Office---

Pam Beesley: Something without Jim would be fantastic. Whether she's desperate at her apartment after breaking up with Roy that she'll give herself up to the landlord for more time/lesser rent... Maybe she's lonely and lets a warehouse guy take her for a ride that she can't help but want to relive on a nearly daily basis? Or an intern that she catches taking a liking to her and who knows where they go from there!

Jan: Another cougar that needs a young man. She's shown many times over that she loves interns and younger men in general!

Erin: Someone very dominate for her since she seems to be unsure/innocent... and she needs somebody that can break her of that streak.

Kelly: I have a feeling that she'd use just about anyone to make Ryan jealous. Let's give her a new person to do just that with. We can figure out if he's a perfect fit for her or just a guy with a dick that can shut her up for a few minutes at a time while they do some dirty things with one another!

Others: Angela, Meredith, Holly Flax....

Feel free to toss almost anyone else at me too as I'm sure I've missed some! Looking for something potentially long-term but I'm more then happy with just doing one scene if you'd rather go that route!

3ppbql,5,2015-10-21,"I [25 F] think I just realized my perfect guy BF of almost three years[26 M], is never going to be the man for me",brokenandconfused11,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3ppbql/i_25_f_think_i_just_realized_my_perfect_guy_bf_of/,"I have been with my boyfriend for almost three years now, we have been living together for the last year and a half. We started out perfect, and I have long thought he was the most amazing guy. I just knew, without a doubt we were going to be together forever. However slowly things have changed and it just hit me that I might really need to get out of this situation.



For the duration of our relationship I have been in a intense school program, while working two other jobs. Things have always been busy and we have looked forward to having a more normal life together. During this time, he started going to school as well, he wasn't working and he moved in with his dad when he started school. For about 6 months I paid for everything we did, and would even give him money for gas and stuff like that if he needed. I never minded because I always believed in him, and knew he was working toward our future.



After 6 months, he got a job and we moved in together. Now we were both full time students with full time jobs, but we were having a great time together. He started making more money then I was and I started to notice some resentment. It would just be a few snide comments here and there, and I figured he was just stressed. 



Fast forward to about 4 months ago, I am in my senior internship, working 12 night shifts (3 for school and two for work) 5 in a row. The house is a mess, I hardly have time to clean, and I am miserable from my lack of sleep. On the bright side, I am getting rave reviews and lots of positive feedback from my internship!



However he is more resentful then ever. Every day he makes comments that I am lazy and have no friends, and that I don't do anything around the house! (Hello I'm working 5 12hr shits a week!) This really breaks me down. It hurts me so much because I want the man I love to see me for who I am, I want him to be proud of me, the way I am proud of myself. I was so hurt and really shocked by his lack of support as I achieved this huge goal! 



I tired to talk things out, let things go and move on. He seemed to get better, he was much nicer and I could tell he honestly felt bad for not being my support system.



But it doesn't stop, whenever he gets mad he tries to hurt me with words. He tells me I don't do anything and that I am a sad person. He tells me that he is scared to have kids with me because I will probably end up with Post partum depression (PPD). That kills me, not that I am expecting to have PPD, but if I did, wouldn't I want to know that the man I am with is going to be there by my side, supporting me?



Today it hit me that he seems so far from who I thought he was. I honestly don't feel like he truly loves me. Whenever I get upset that he is talking to me that way he says ""Why do you care what I think? you should have confidence in yourself, unless you know what I am saying is true, you shouldn't be so insecure"" I just want to scream at him!



Its not unheard of to want the man you love to have respect and admiration for you! Of course it matters to me what he thinks about me! 



I honestly don't know where to go from here.



TLDR: boyfriend of my dreams is borderline verbally abusive, not the man I fell in love with. Not sure how to proceed

3ppc6m,1,2015-10-21,Is it possible to build enough credit in 5 months before I get my first apartment?,salazar_slytherin,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3ppc6m/is_it_possible_to_build_enough_credit_in_5_months/,"Hi everyone,

I am a senior in college, and I currently have student loans under my name but co-signed by my mother. My best friend has been living in New York for the last year but is moving back to Maryland in March, and we are talking about getting an apartment together. I know that having a good credit score is important when applying, so I was going to apply for a credit card where I already have a debit. I am pretty good with financial discipline for the most part. I am taking a full load at school, but I also work two jobs (one for $15/hour for 20 hours/week and one for $10/hour + commission for 12-15 hours/week) and just started an internship that will be paid soon—I just don't know the exact numbers yet. I do freelance work as well, but since that's unpredictable, I usually don't count that in my income.

With that being said, is it possible for me to build enough credit so my friend and I can get approved for an apartment in March? Additionally, would it be just straight up stupid for me to move out with my current financial situation? I pay $220/month for my car, probably about $70/month on gas, $20/month for Adobe Creative Cloud, and I usually set aside about $300 for other expenses. I also have $150/month set aside to my savings account. My friend and I are looking at apartments $1100/month split in half.

Thank you!"
3ppq5z,1,2015-10-21,Internships/Wages question,newstudent_here,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3ppq5z/internshipswages_question/,"Hey guys, my first post here. 
Anyway, on to the post:

I'm currently 21 years old, junior in college, studying Computer Science.

About a month ago, I went to our school's career fair, and talked to a few recruiters and handed out my resume. One company I talked to took my resume and told me to apply online. I never actually applied online for them, and then late yesterday afternoon, I got a phone call from the recruiter I talked to, saying they would like me to come in for an interview.

The interview is set up for tomorrow (The 22nd!). My question is this:

This will be my first internship. I know internships are great experience, especially for my field. I currently have a part time job tutoring people for Computer Science classes, making $10/hr. Obviously if I am offered $10/hr by the company, I will accept that. But what would my best course of action be, if I am offered say, $8/hr?

While the experience can be invaluable on a resume once I graduate, I obviously also need money *now* for college.

Thanks for any advice."

Backstory: Girlfriend has an internship and they meet on wednesdays at a nearby coffee shop to work on editing the book they're working on (english major). 

Anyway, I forgot she was at internship and I text her about food:
    
    Me: hey you hungry?
    
    Her: yea but I'm at internship
    * i got busy with something and didn't reply for few mins*

    Her: It's over but $friend wants to get coffee with me

    Me: Okay. just text me when you're done and we'll go eat at $restaurant
  

I figure they would drink coffee and catch up for 2 hours top. just be girls


4 hours later and no reply to my invite to go eat. I text her just to make sure she's okay and still alive. She replies letting me know she's okay. 

It's at this point I realize she saw the invite. So, it's an hour until the place closes and I'm hungry so I get dressed and go by myself. She calls me while I'm eating:

    Her: hey, where are you?
    
    Me: I'm at $restaurant
    
    Her: *clearly upset* ....What?
    
    Me: I'm at $restaurant
    
    Her: well..okay then, I'll see you later?
    
    Me: See you when I get back

I thought it was ridiculous to continue to wait on her and let the place close. Thoughts?

How should I handle this going forward? I feel this was the correct move since my goal is to more things myself and not rely on people so much to have fun

I don't really think that ""light"" fits here, but the other two were even farther away from how I feel.

**I feel like I should say that I am not looking for sympathy, but I AM looking for empathy. So maybe stories of similar feelings of inadequacy.** 

If you have advice, that's fine, but I'm not here for a ""boo hoo, suck it up"" please. Lets take that as read, shall we?

**My Issue**

I am just very sad that I don't have a thick penis. Now I know that you will be annoyed when I say that someone whose penis girth is slightly below average, is sad about not being above average. Yes I am well aware that guys have it WAY worse(if you buy into the ""size matters"" view, which I do). Hear me out.

**I want to be lusted after.**

Life is not going well for me, and I have a myriad of issues, but I have always been a very sexual person, yet have not been successful in having sex yet, at the age of 29.

I am short, ugly, with disproportionate features, as well as other issues that bother me. I have a shit degree, and am unemployable, and my depression and anxiety are a never ending struggle. Life basically sucks royal ass.

Who am I? Well, I am someone who volunteers, has an internship (which my depression is fucking up), studies (1 class), goes to Toastmasters, and who exercises fairly regularly and eats healthily (I have lost 50lbs this year, since feb). I also am in therapy and on anti-depressants.

I am also a kissless virgin who can't get going in life. I also really want sex and have wanted it since the age of maybe 11? I didn't know what it was, but I remember thinking, I need to find a way to convince a future wife to be naked with me. I thought it would be appropriate to make it a rule of the house. ""No clothes when sleeping."" I knew nothing about sex yet.

There are all these hoops to jump through, but I really crave the attention of women that I find attractive (I get no attn from ANYONE, but this is about what I want, not practicality). 

I know of people who are enjoying very active sex lives and are good looking and my feelings of exclusion and self loathing intensify exponentially. So many of these women talk about how an above average dick (not huge) feels amazing.

I just want to be what women want. I want to have wide appeal but not a single one of my attributes gives me a chance. Add to that the label of loser, which is completely justified by my situation, and virgin. I have missed out on my youth and I hate myself so much for it. (Regret = pointless to summarize my therapist, but the feeling persists)

I wish to feel like I am more than enough for the majority of women. Completely irrational, but at this moment, that's how I feel. I wish I could know that I am what women lust after. NOT tolerate, but lust after. NOT mildly enjoy, but lust. after.

I know I can't have a thicker penis, or the appeal that I wish for. I am sad because of this. I know there is nothing to be done. :(

**For Reference**
There was a [study](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0133079) that came out recently that shows that women want an above average girth for casual sex, and that due to the demographics of the study, this might be an underestimate for the wider population."

3pr28i,6,2015-10-22,I [26F] fear that my husband [31M] doesn't have empathy,falcunpun,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3pr28i/i_26f_fear_that_my_husband_31m_doesnt_have_empathy/,"I'm somewhere between numb and sad right now. This realization has been sneaking up on me for a while, but last evening it hit me like a truck. 

My husband and I have been together for about 6 years total, married for 4. 

What drew me to him was (besides his physical attractiveness) was his sensitivity. He had an earnest naiveté about him that charmed me. He was (and still is in many ways) attentive, sensitive, and thoughtful. If I had to ascribe to him a ""love language"", it would be ""acts of service"". He cleans, does dishes, folds, does laundry, and is always available to help me with pretty much any action I need (preparation of legal documents, for example). All I pretty much do is cook (he insists for it to be this way). 

I absolutely love this about him, and he does it to an extent that others might even be surprised/jealous. 

However. Yesterday evening made me realize a trend that I'm not sure if I can ever be okay with. 

I've been having a difficult time with...well, life in general right now. To summarize, we moved to his native country (a ""western"" one) about a year and a half ago. I speak the language fluently and have citizenship here, so I didn't have any objections to it. Unfortunately, it's going through a pretty bad crisis, with young graduates being hit the hardest. We struggled to find employment for the first 6 - 8 months, and now both of us have found average (for here) paying jobs.  He seems to be thriving in his, and it seems likely that they will offer him a permanent contract with a possible raise early next year. 

For me, however, a combination of issues with a toxic manager and budget restrictions have guaranteed that after spring, I won't be able to continue.  

My job search so far has made it obvious that anything I'd have a chance at being considered for is an internship, which for here, you need to be enrolled in a university to get. To make matters worse, unless you come from a handful of top, nationally recognized business schools, you're pretty much SOL.

I could technically apply for one of these schools--and I will--but IF I get in, I'd have to figure out how to finance them, as they're very expensive and my husband can't really support both of us on just his salary.

I'm still applying for what I can, but basically, I can't help but feel lost and anxious right now. I think that's normal. 

So last night after work, I came back in a sad mood. I brought up the idea of moving to a different country in a few years--one where we'd have a good chance at having higher salaries and promotions without stagnating, as is likely here. 

He was on board with this, but said he wanted it to be an ""exotic"" country and had no interest in any of the Western countries I was wanting to settle in (for the record, I'm fine with spending a year or so in an Asian country, but I don't really see them as places you can settle in long-term).  This sparked a disagreement, and he asked if I had a bad day or something.

I got emotional, and told him that I felt lost. He seemed confused, and asked what that meant. I explained to him how I'm anxious about my situation through teary eyes.  First he interrupted me to not ""yell"", as I apparently was being too loud. Then, he was preoccupied in chasing a mosquito, looking around, and generally looking annoyed and disinterested. 

This got me pretty upset, and I told him that as a husband, I expected for him to at least show some sort of concern.

He got even more annoyed, and said that basically in his opinion, I don't really have a reason to be sad/anxious, because just a month ago I was acting excited about the idea of going to school, and my reasons for being sad/lost don't seem very profound. ""Maybe if you actually take action instead of just sitting and complaining about it, then I might feel more like comforting you.""

I was floored at this. I told him that the least I expected from any friend--especially a spouse--is some general empathy. Listen, pat my back, offer a hug, tell me it'll all be okay in the end--let me know that you're here for me!

He said, ""Well, if that's what you expect from a husband, then I guess I can't be your husband.""

I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I remembered that this wasn't the first time he had acted like this. 

A few years ago, I was working a really shitty part time job at a coffee shop. I would come back sad and drained, and wanted to feel like at least one person cared for me. In retrospect, I admit that I probably did vent too much for that job, but I felt stuck (I was not in a position to quit).  He was again, generally annoyed with me, and quite cold.

He seems generally annoyed with people in general--our neighbors are always too loud, people are rude, inconsiderate, etc etc. Not sure if it's relevant, but his mom is the same way. She lives alone with a lot of cats, and never gets along with people for very long (they end up offending her in some way).

Later that night, my sadness turned to anger. I said, ""who are YOU to decide whether my emotions are valid or not? That's not your place. When you see someone you supposedly love hurting, you comfort them! I can't imagine seeing you hurting the way you saw me, and reacting the way you did.""

He got very quiet and told me that I'm right, but that he didn't know how to fix it, and wasn't sure if he could/wanted to. 

I asked him that if he KNEW not fixing it would make me leave, would he still not want to? He got very quiet at that, and said that maybe he needed therapy.

This morning, he was withdrawn. He said he was drained, and needed time to heal.  

I don't know what I'm looking for here. I want more than anything to fix this. I want for us to have a functional relationship. I'm just sad.

Ask us anything!,learningequality,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3psh40/we_are_learning_equality_and_we_are_bringing/,"Hi Reddit! We are a non-profit called Learning Equality and we just had our 2.1 millionth student in August! 

Who we are:
We are a 2 and a half year old nonprofit and we work with partnerships all over the world to bring online learning tools via our KALite project (an offline, lightweight version of Khan Academy) to people from all walks of life such as children in remote villages in Ghana to inmates in Ohio, and everyone in between! 

What we’re doing:
We just launched a campaign to expand this project from KALite to Kolibri, a more robust learning platform built on extremely cheap hardware and one capable of allowing local content curators to produce their own content instead of relying on those produced by others. What this means in the end, is kids in Africa, South America, India, and many other places learning about what is important to them instead of the California Gold Rush. 

About us:
I’m Seth, I’ve been an intern here since January and have worked on many things, including designing and implementing a dashboard interface for teachers/coaches, helping other design developments such as logos and mascots, and actually helping with our current Kolibri push (so meta). I’ll be sourcing responses from  our Co-Founder and Software Architecture Lead, Jamie, our Software Development Lead, Aron, our Learning Lead, Richard, and one of our UX Designers, Jessica.

Jamie (/u/jamalex) is our Software Architecture Lead and also co-founded Learning Equality. He has been passionate for many years about leveraging technology to help make learning more open and more effective, and he is co-founder of several educational technology platforms, including [thisCourse](http://thiscourse.com/), [ESL Genie](http://eslgenie.com/), and [KA Lite](https://learningequality.org/ka-lite/). 

Aron (/u/aronasorman) is Software Development Lead and has been with Learning Equality for 2 years. He's worked on internationalization, server administration and just general development. He has a sweet tooth and usually works for snacks.

Richard’s (/u/rtibbles) job is to ensure that Learning is at the heart of everything we do. Whether that is in the heart of our software, to ensure that learners and teachers are supported and guided appropriately, with his hands in the code and overseeing the design of the User Experience; ensuring that team members are learning and growing; or that the organisation is learning and evolving as a whole.

Jessica (/u/jtamiace) came in as an intern and stuck around for the long haul. She’s worked on just about anything that we’ve made that has some sort of interface. When she’s not staring at things and pondering at how to make them look better, she’s usually off playing her ukulele or, more likely, dancing.

Ask us anything!

You can cross reference with the pics of us on https://learningequality.org/about/team/

A little more info:
We have the great fortune of being able to boast more than 2.1 million students, deployments in all 50 states, as well as 160 countries. 

Mostly, we’ve historically relied on people finding our software on their own, which is open source, and installing it themselves, or other organizations adopting KALite for their mission. Our Kolibri project is an undertaking to not only make the platform more robust and have local content for local needs, but also in order to have a standardized set of hardware we can roll out in kits, which would minimize the complexity of deployments. We’re also looking to make the software easier to use and more open to customization. Previously, in order to update content you had to sync with the internet which is… less than ideal in an area specifically without internet. Our new vision is a platform that you can take home on your tablet, and share/update content if your friend has it on their tablet. If you’ve got a little money you can spare, it would mean a lot to us and go a long way! Your support will help us reach our target of reaching 10 million offline students in the next 3 years.

3psiw8,15,2015-10-22,[Discussion] Counseling in Public Schools,BeakerFullOfDeath,psychotherapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychotherapy/comments/3psiw8/discussion_counseling_in_public_schools/,"I'm an LPC Intern who has recently begun counseling students at an elementary school to supplement the school counselor there (schools in this district have only one school counselor per school at the elementary level). 

&amp;nbsp;


I have a lot of experience working with kids in a private practice and community setting, but working with kids at a school seems to be a whole other ball game in terms of the dynamics that go on with the teachers, administrative staff, parents, etc, and you really get to see a lot of this at play in real time versus seeing a child once a week at an outside office.

&amp;nbsp;

An interesting thing I've been seeing is that everybody has a different view of what is going on and what children need:

&amp;nbsp;

When I talk to the principals about what their ""problem kids"" need they say ""More structure in the home."" (Meaning more discipline)

&amp;nbsp;

When I talk to teachers about what their ""problem kids"" need they say ""Better focus and attention on their work."" (Often meaning less fidgeting, less talking in class, more motivation).

&amp;nbsp;

When I talk to parents about what their ""problem kids"" need they say ""I have no idea, he seems just fine at home.""

&amp;nbsp;

When I ask the therapist (myself) what the ""problem kids"" need I say ""More effective mindfulness and emotional self regulation skills.""

&amp;nbsp;


When I ask the school psychologists what the ""problem kids"" need they say ""More psych testing."" (Often resulting in medication and special ed classes)

&amp;nbsp;

Whether or not any of these views is right or wrong is beside the point, what I've been struggling with is how we can use all of this in a way that works for us?

&amp;nbsp;


The school environment is one of ""shallow touches"". There are only so many hours and so many students that when you break it down each student gets very little individual focus over the course of their education, and too many end up falling through the cracks.

&amp;nbsp;

In your experience, what differences (if any) have you seen when working in a school setting vs. working out of an office? How does your work change from one setting to another?"

Offer #1 - This is with the company I have been interning with for the past year and 2 months. They are looking at having me travel a lot to go work on projects at a few plants around the world. I am very interested in traveling the world and have no ties to keep me any one place. I suspect I can get them to offer $75k base pay.

Offer #2 - This is an American oil company that my brother works at. They offered to put me in as basically a glorified operator (meaning I will sit at a computer, adjust valves, trend data, and work swing shift). This may be my stepping stone to get in as a petroleum engineer with a fortune 500 company. They offered to pay me $58k for this starting position. I would also like to note that the location they want me to relocate to is not my ideal place to live.

What do you guys think? What should I take into consideration? Am I wrong in feeling that I am worth more than what I am being offered?

Thank you ahead of time for any insight."
3ptgyp,1,2015-10-22,[B4] Accepted an offer of PS Audit but want Advisory/Consulting. Help!?,toastynuttybase,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/3ptgyp/b4_accepted_an_offer_of_ps_audit_but_want/,"Hey guys, as an introduction i'm in the UK, but will be grateful for advice from the US and beyond. Basically, I completed an internship at a Big Four firm in the UK, in Public Sector Audit. Long story short, I enjoyed it (loved the firm and people I was working with), but then again I was treated like royalty, worked 9-5 at most, and I know it's not quite what is is hyped up to be.  

I have now been offered a place on the ACCA Graduate Scheme in PS Audit. Truth is, it's an offer I couldn't really refuse as I was given 3 weeks to accept the offer, and a further 2 week extension - which was up before I even began my final year at University, (and before any other graduate schemes were open - sneaky).

I have well researched and know the benefits of sticking out 4 years with a Big Four firm, (3 years to pass ACCA and 1 year of qualified working experience), but know I wouldn't really enjoy it, and I am worried about getting pigeon holed into an accounting career for life, which is not what I want. I am much more interested in a management consulting/ Advisory role, and I am applying to some at the moment (knowing I have already accepted the offer - but I'm not meant to start till September 2016). However like I said, I did really enjoy my time with the firm, so, my question is whether it would be worth contacting the recruitment/HR to see if I could attempt a transfer onto the Business/Management consultancy scheme (still available in the same office as my original offer)? Would this entail more interviews? Would be original offer still be available if I failed the interviews for consultancy? Would this put a 'black mark' on my name? Is it best to keep it quiet for now, and try and transfer internally when I am there in September? Is there a probationary period where I can dabble in all areas, audit, tax, advisory, consulting etc and then pick a line to follow? What is the process like for transferring into consulting post ACCA qualification?

Basically a lot of questions from a confused 20 year old who is expected to (maybe already has), sign his life away to a relatively dull, mediocre paying career.

TL:DL - Accepted a PS Audit role - want to do Advisory/ Consulting. How do/ can I transfer internally?

Any advice on the matter will be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"
3ptt2r,6,2015-10-22,Me [23 M] with my now Ex girlfriend[24 F] broke up a few months ago after a 3 year relationship. I can't take the breakup.,helpmeplease_2,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3ptt2r/me_23_m_with_my_now_ex_girlfriend24_f_broke_up_a/,"Hey, I've been truly desperate these past few weeks and I have really no where to turn. I have friends, a lot of friends, but not someone I can open up to and talk to - because my ex (let's call her Laura) was my best friend.


I met Laura back in college about 6 years ago, we were just friends and lab partners. Fast forward 2 years and she texts me happy birthday and we just kind of hit it off. We were both new to dating (I never had a relationship before Laura, and I was happy being alone until I met her). Laura was very hard to convince to go out, she was very shy, but after a few dates we were officially boyfriend and girlfriend.

Before Laura I was never with any other girl, no serious relationships, but me and her had the best chemistry a couple can wish for. She was literally my everything, and I was hers. We were perfect (I know people tend to say that, but we really were...) Fast forward a few months and that's where trouble begun. See I'm Jewish and she's Greek, and for me a relationship is very serious. We were discussing what would happen if this gets too serious and decided to break it off (Note that this was very shortly after we started dating).

We remained friends, played video games together and were still hanging out - we were madly in love with eachother at that point. Imagine loving someone, knowing you want to just grab them and kiss them, but you know you can't because you're not together, it was awful.

BUT, good news, a few months later we decided to get back together after she left for an internship for about 3 months. Being away from her was too much and we were together for 2 years after that.

That's the back story, but I do want to mention that Laura is literally everything for me, I loved her, I still love her and I can't see myself being with anyone else. Thinking of her makes me happy and when I think about our breakup I just break down - i literally feel sick to my stomach.

So, the breakup - After 2 years of the best time of my life with Laura. We both graduated from university, I found a decent job and we started talking about the future. She agreed to raise our kids jewish, have a jewish wedding but she didn't want to convert. Which was fine with me, she gave up everything she could and I loved that about her. Her family was ok with it too (and I want to mention that her family loves me and i love them, I'm good friends with her siblings and get along with everyone).

So I go to tell my parents that I might have a reform wedding with her, and that I want to be with her and my parents flip out. Telling me that I ruined the family, that I can forget about seeing them again, that I will never hear from them again and that (mainly my mom) will make sure to turn the family against me. See at the time I didn't have a job quite yet (I signed a contract but didnt start working) and I was scared of all her threats (my mom delivers....) I didn't want to ruin the family. It was the last thing I wanted to do. I told everything to Laura and explained to her the situation and it really strained our relationship.


It's like we both knew what was coming... and then... poof we broke up. At first, I was ok with it. I started a new job, I thought I have my life ahead of me to find someone - but I was wrong, there is no one in this world I rather be with than Laura. I know I keep saying that and most of you might be like ""just move on"" but I can't...


A month after our breakup Laura went to Greece to her grandmother (who lives in a village with no internet) she wrote me letters saying she misses me and during this time I told my mother I will never forgive her for what she did, and in fact I no longer speak to her. Laura was gone for 2 months and all I thought about is how I can get back together with her, I spoke to my siblings and they all had my back that they will never stop talking to me if I was with Laura. This gave me confidence and I decided to try my best to get back with her... but... surprise surprise Laura doesn't want to get back - she had so much fun in Greece and saw everything she would have to give up and decided that she doesn't want to be with me anymore. I try to talk to her and tell her how I feel, but she doesn't want to listen to it. She's been back a little over a week now and I only saw her once, When I saw her I just wanted to hold her and kiss her, but of course I can't do that. I even wrote her a letter to explain the entire ordeal to her, but her response was ""delete it"" and ""maybe you should move on"".


Now I know that most of you are saying ""well just move on then"", but in her letters she kept telling that she missed me, this ""move on"" stuff is recent, and I actually believe in us NOW more than ever. I believe we can be together, and be happy together... but I don't see how I can make her see that.


I'm super depressed, I have a hard time going to work (when I'm there I'm fine), but until then I'm thinking about staying in bed taking a sick day, after work I go to the gym and just think while working out... The only thing keeping me from being a total mess is that I believe that one day I'll end up with Laura again. I don't know what to do anymore.


I should mention that we still talk and text everyday... Play together... We're still very close friends and I guess that makes it that much harder :(


Reddit, help me.

   
**tl;dr**:
Broke up with my best friend and girlfriend of 3 years because my mother told me that she will ""disown"" me if I married/stayed with her. I decided to make my own decision and get back with my girlfriend, but she wants me to move on (rightfully so I believe...)"

I am a 20 year old college student and I have the money on hand for a new laptop under $2000 and I'm looking for something that is high quality and will last me a long time (4-5 years?), while being thin and light. I am getting an internship as an Info Sys Intern and one of my job responsibilities is graphic design, so I want a laptop that can and will be able to handle a lot of image manipulation. I also need something that can sort through big data fast and run advanced Excel tasks quickly. Apart from business I will be using it for light gaming.

The two laptops that I am looking at are the Dell XPS 15 (new edition, 9550) and the Macbook Pro. I am leaning towards the XPS since it has a Skylake processor and DDR4 ram, plus it looks sleeker. I have not been able to find any side by side reviews for the current models since it is so new, but do any of you have a recommendation?

The XPS 15 I'm looking at in particular is the Core i7 8GB version as I assume I can upgrade the ram and SSD if needed in the future."

Age:14

Sex/Neuter status:Male/fixed

Breed:Himalayan

Body weight:9.9 lbs

History:Hx of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy since 2009, under control with use of 10-12.5 mg of Lasix BID.
2009 presented with drooling, dyspnea and utter lethargy-was taken to an emergency vet and was put on oxygen and treated for 2/3 days. He had fluid in his lung and heart (Dr told us he had congestive heart failure) Subsequently he was placed on about 4 medications but ultimately we decided to take him off of everything except the lasix to keep clearing the fluid in his system and has been on 10-12.5 mg of lasix two times per day since mid 2009. He had one episode about 1.5 years ago where he was exhibiting very strange behavior: wouldn't eat, wouldn't move and had a loud strange cry for a few days. We took him to our internal medicine/heart doctor they did neurological testing and said he was ""fine"". We ended up going to another vet where they gave him fluid under the skin, an antibiotic for a ""bladder infection"" and changed him to a pill form of flea medicine. He was fine after that. Until this week.

Clinical signs:Started with slight malaise and also vomited 2-3 times saturday evening (sat breakfast was eaten as normal). Sunday he had no appetite, lethargy, lack of movement, being quiet/not as playful or vocal as usual. Monday morning we took him to the vet thinking it was something to do with his heart-we found an urgent care that could take us, who also had a cardiology specialist in house on that day (after a few unpleasant experiences with our previous internal medicine vet-we didn't really trust going there this time) they got the records from the previous vet and the ER Doc checked him in, they asked to keep him overnight. Monday evening she called to let us know that he had elevated Kidney values: 130 BUN (normal is 36 and 10 (normal is 2.5) creatinine. She said he was extremely dehydrated and that they were slowly pushing fluids as not to disturb his preexisting heart condition. She also asked me if I would want him to be recessitated if his heart were to stop. She also said they were going to give him antibiotics because he could have a kidney infection. She mentioned that he had a hematocrit of 26% (normal is 30). He also had elevated phosphorous (she didn't say how elevated). In 2013 (the last set of kidney labs he had) had normal values. They did an echocardiogram which showed the preexisting condition but the atrium was not enlarged (she said that he was super dehydrated so it could be because of that). The next day the rotating intern called and told me that the BUN was still over 140 (yes she said 140 not 130) and that the Creatinine had come down only to 9.6. She said he was also showing ever more signs of anemia as the blood became more and more dilute from the IV fluids. She said it was now at 20% hematocrit and she presumed he would be in the low teens by the time he was fully hydrated. She also said there was no way he would be hydrated in the next two days. She said she wanted to draw up a new treatment plan for another 4 or 5 days. She also said he would have to be on hormones to stimulate RBC production for the rest of his life. It would take about three weeks for the hormone to take affect and would cost about 500$ per month. Since Tuesday evening, he has been home. I was uncertain that I was doing the right thing for him-he hates being at the vet. I have been giving him between 1.5 and 3ml of IV fluid under the skin every day and he has been drinking water and peeing in between sleeping a lot. He has seemed like he is livelier and more himself each day. He was smelling pretty badly-he had stopped cleaning himself-and he had started to smell pretty awful but now he is seeming more like himself: his coat has become fluffier and healthier looking. He has even started cleaning his coat a little bit. I had set up a home euthenization appointment and have been keeping vigil with the poor guy since Tuesday and reading articles and things sent to me about Chronic Kidney Disease/Renal Failure. Today I rescheduled our in home appointment because I am uncertain as to what the best choice is. I understand that home treatment of such a disease is an intense time and money commitment but I love my little beast so much that I would do anything for him. I just don't want him to suffer more then he needs to and that is what stops me from making either choice.

Duration:6 days (but pre-existing heart condition/health issues since 2009)

&gt; GoDaddy, a company still perhaps best known for using scantily clad women to sell web domain name registrations, has been working hard to rehabilitate its image.

&gt; Its latest move in that campaign: the release of its diversity report, which goes one step further than most others by revealing pay disparities between men and women working at the company.

&gt; Across the total company, women are paid 0.28 percent more than men, and non-technical female workers are paid 0.35 percent more than men.

&gt; The number of women at the company in technical jobs now stands at 20 percent, and 25 percent of management jobs are held by women, both improvements since last year, and on par or a little better than the tech industry&amp;#039;s biggest companies.

&gt; GoDaddy also says it&amp;#039;s tweaked its strategies for hiring more women on, increasing the number of women interns and new college graduate hires from 14 percent to 39 percent year over year.

Feminazi Kate Iselin tries to date male feminists, [only to discover that they actually repulse her](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/19/why-i-wont-date-another-male-feminist). Hamster wheel spinning, she rationalizes that it's because men are ""sexualizing her politics"" or ""politicizing her sexuality"" and couldn't possibly be because she's not turned on by wimps who can't think for themselves.

**Annotated body**

&gt;For anyone with even a passing interest in gender equality or women’s rights, it’s a relief to see feminism becoming more and more mainstream. No longer solely the domain of crotchety academics who demand we take a lighter to our lingerie, feminism’s makeover for the new millennium has made it as accessible and fun as a Beyoncé single – and it’s everywhere we look. There are feminist boxing classes, feminist baking groups, and, of course, feminist dating websites. Because when we talk about “having it all”, we also want a feminist boyfriend, right?

""As accessible and fun as a Beyoncé single,"" eh? I suppose it's a barrel of fuckin' laughs when you're lucky enough to be born as the gender [everyone bends over backwards to take care of and appease](https://mensresistance.wordpress.com/female-privilege-checklist/). However, when you're a man trying to find a male place to do traditionally male things like, oh... I don't know, a fucking *boxing class*, it's not nearly as much fun.

&gt;In theory, it sounds excellent. It would be a hard slog to have a relationship with someone whose sociopolitical stance differs hugely from yours, so when I first began identifying as a feminist I thought that my beliefs would carry over seamlessly in to my dating life as well. I’m a feminist, so shouldn’t the men I date and sleep with be feminists too?

Apparently not, since this entire errant rant is about how they don't arouse you and in fact piss you off and offend you.

&gt;Unfortunately, it wasn’t quite so simple. From the man who opened a text conversation with a photo of his naked chest and encouraged me to reciprocate in the name of the *Free The Nipple* movement, to the fellow who agonised over accepting a blowjob because, despite enjoying them, he found the act simply too degrading to let me perform; dating male feminists turned out to be one of the least empowering decisions I’ve ever made.

I honestly can't stop laughing at either of these.

&gt;It’s not that I don’t want to be with a man who respects me, values consent, or is conscious of the various gender-based imbalances in the world today. These qualities are a bare minimum.

That's because most of the inequalities and gender-based imbalances in western culture are balanced *in favor of women*. There are women's health centers, women's self-defense classes, ladies' nights out, businesses give preferential treatment to female applicants to fill quotas, there are women's only colleges like Bryn Mawr, certain colleges even [offer reduced or free tuition for women to enter certain fields](http://www.gracehopper.com/)... The list is never ending.

Put some of that privilege our way, girls!

&gt;But men looking for feminist-sanctioned romance tend to fall in to one of two categories: those who use our attraction as a sign of approval and seek out trophy feminists to clear their conscience of any inherent patriarchal wrong-doing, and outright predators who employ a bare-bones knowledge of feminist discourse to target any young woman whose politics so much as graze the notion of sex-positivity.

Let me see if I understand: there are guys looking for sluts, and guys looking to blame themselves for your problems. Do I have that right? Lady, I think you need to grow up. There is no such thing as the patriarchy, and it's time you learned that your issues are your own. And for fucks sake, when you're bitching about not being able to suck a cock with proper abandon three paragraphs ago *it kind of undermines your point about not wanting to be selected because of your sex-positivity!*

By the way, ""sex-positivity"" takes too goddamn long to type. Henceforth I'm just going to call it ""slut.""

And finally, do you have the faintest notion of what a predator actually is? The fact that you are ~~sex-positive~~ a slut and make that pretty well known by *advertising internationally in a Guardian editorial* means that there is a pretty good chance that a man who just wants to fuck is going to reply to your advertisement. Jesus H. Goddamn *Christ* would you use some fucking common sense? If you want a plumber, don't advertise for a fucking *carpenter!* You want a respectful guy who doesn't see you as a sex object. (They don't exist, but whatever.) That's great, but maybe not go posting about how much you could get into having a dick in your mouth if the guy would shut up. Just a little suggestion free of charge. 

&gt;The commercialisation of “feminist dating”, whether at a social event or on an app or website, only entrenches these attitudes further. It laser-focuses the male gaze on an environment where men can hamfistedly wield their limited knowledge of women’s empowerment to look for sex partners and girlfriends in a movement that demands women be seen as everything but.

Do you think the problem is that men *don't know* or *don't care*? You're not *empowered*. You merely feel *entitled*. (Hat tip to u/absolucion for this phrasing.)

&gt;For every male feminist horror story I have lived, I’ve been told a dozen more by equally-frustrated female friends. There was the chap who invited me to an event, not so much as a plus one but as a testing ground for his ribald, sexist one-liners. After each remark he would look to me, gauging my reaction to see exactly how much of his cheap and dirty humour he could unleash while still passing the feminist litmus test.

Was it more or less degrading than the things comediennes like Sandra Bernhard and Amy Schumer [say about men?](http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/the-highs-and-lows-of-amy-schumers-comedy/) It's probably a good thing you weren't on a date with me.

I'm okay with the blowjob thing, though. Call me?

&gt;I had lunch with a man whose openness about sex and sexuality impressed me until I declined his offer for an afternoon quickie – his response made it clear that his feminism had no room for my apparent frigidity.

I'm pretty sure that you didn't fuck this guy in question, and speaking of questions, I have one: *If he had been hot enough, would his supposedly 'sexist' jokes have met with more approval, or would you still be offended by them?*

You outright state that you were impressed that he was open about sex and sexuality, but somehow repulsed by his *actual desire to have sex with you.* This is the hamster at its absolute finest. You were fine with discussing sex in the abstract, because you were only *moderately* attracted to him. But the moment he escalated, you were right back to, ""Ew! As if!""

&gt;Then there was the gentleman who messaged me every second day to ask my fem-pinion on everything from vajazzling to Lena Dunham’s memoir. When I finally asked him to cool his jets, he responded furiously that I should be grateful for his incessant questions and I was lucky a man wanted to hear my opinion at all.

I am so incredibly happy beyond words that I don't have a fucking *clue* what vajazzling is. Seriously. I'm fucking gleeful, and if anyone actually tells me, I will punch them in the dick.

As for being lucky, well, aren't you? I'm lucky to be living in a world where I can write a post on a social networking site and get a thousand people to read it. I'm honored to have been a part of a YouTube video that had over two million hits and went viral in 31 hours. 

You're pretty damn lucky that someone decided your sexist opinions were worth making into a rather insipid blog and putting on the web and then actually *paid you for it*. You live in a time where your whining, however trivial, is picked up and trumpeted by people around the globe. Shouldn't you consider yourself lucky for that? 

You feminists crack me up. You bleat and whinge on at full volume that no one listens to you, but the moment someone actually goes out of their way to actually ask you for your opinion, it really offends you. Seriously, would you fucking pick one?

I'm willing to bet, judging from the tone of this editorial, that you probably didn't politely say, ""Hey, man, I appreciate that you want my opinion, but I'd rather you hold this for a later time."" More likely, you were just as solipsistic and bitchy as you come across here, and that probably rankled a little bit with him just as it does with me. The difference is that the moment I heard the phrase, ""I'm a feminist,"" come out of your mouth, I'd have noped the fuck out. 

Unless we were still talking about that ~~sex-positive~~ slutty blowjob thing. Seriously, why have you not called?

&gt;It’s not that I don’t think men can be feminists. 

No, you're right. They can't. It's about the same as a cockroach becoming an exterminator. You feminists pride yourselves on the eradication of everything masculine. A man becoming a feminist is, by definition, erasing everything that has ever made him a man with the exception of a couple flaps of skin. Better to just commit seppuku and be done with it rather than the slow death by erasure of everything that has ever made life worthwhile.

&gt;There are several men in my life who have approached feminism with respect and considerate thought, who have used feminism to examine their own privilege and experiences within the world and have become better people for it.

What privilege? Are you talking about **[THESE AGAIN?](https://mensresistance.wordpress.com/female-privilege-checklist/)**

&gt;But these men are in a disappointing minority compared to the rest of the male feminists I, and many other women, have encountered: men who use the term “feminist” as either bait or an alter-ego, assuming that their opt-in respect for women will entitle them to legions of adoring lovers – really the most anti-feminist act of all.

Protip for you, sweetheart: if you put half as much energy into *equality* that you put into trying to tear down men at the expense of women, there's a possibility that actual, real men might want to have an actual, real conversation with you. Until you do, that blowjob thing is about all you have going for you. (You have my number, right?)

&gt;When it comes to dating and relating, I don’t care who opens the door for whom, or who picks up the bill. I simply want to be in a relationship where my politics aren’t sexualised,

What the actual *fuck* are you talking about? *Feminists* are the ones who sexualized politics, you ignorant quim! Feminists are the ones driving politics of sex so badly that [Herman Cain withdrew his campaign in 2012 based *solely on fabricated accusations of sexual harassment!*](http://articles.latimes.com/2011/dec/03/news/la-pn-cain-announcement-20111203) Did you not even fucking *wonder* why those supposed ""scandals"" absolutely vanished the moment he was out of the running? Because it was never about harassment. It was solely and completely about the *politics*. Feminism is the *only* thing driving Hillary Clinton's campaign. The woman has not one single notable accomplishment in her profession or out of it. Fuck, her husband had to outsource his goddamn blowjobs to an intern! The only reason the woman was elected as a New York Senator was that [during the 2000 debates Rick Lazio crossed the stage to hand her a document](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Lazio#2000_U.S._Senate_campaign) and feminists exploded, claiming he was ""using his maleness to intimidate her as a woman.""

**Politics is all that feminism is!** Without politics, feminism has no reason to be, because without politics, feminism cannot forcibly compel compliance with their edicts of control. Without politics, feminism has no need to *exist!*

&gt; where I can look at my partner and see more than a “Hey girl!” meme come to life and know that they, in turn, see me as a three-dimensional being: a feminist, yes, but not one who will perform on command.

The problem with identity politics is that they become all consuming. The very fact that you identify as a feminist, write as a feminist, and specifically sought out men who were feminists means that you are *not* a three dimensional being. Every man you have derided here is more than you. He doesn't need your politics to survive. Let's face a certain blunt truth: if you didn't have feminism, *you would have absolutely nothing to write about.* It is feminism that keeps you in a job, and without it, *you are nothing.* You are identified by your feminism. You wear it like a cloak and wave it like a banner, and *only* a woman would be hypocritical enough to then bitch about being *identified* by it!

&gt;Feminism has enlightened and empowered me,

*Negative, Ghost Rider.* Feminism has endarkened and entitled you. You have no more power than any other person, and certainly less than the men you complain about. Here you are, bitching away, and the funny thing is that I am willing to bet none of those men found it necessary to blog online about how you treated them. Your entire article reads like a 2004 Livejournal post. The only thing you needed was a section entitled ""Currently listening to:"" where you could put in ""The Cure.""

&gt; and now I’m using that power to put my foot down and say “no more” to the movement’s male members. bell hooks is nobody’s wingwoman. And while it may be correct to say #NotAllMaleFeminists, I would simply rather: not any.

So apparently you're giving up on the Betas who couldn't give you the tingles, eh? You seem to have three remaining options. 1. Dyke it out. 2. Dildo-of-the-Month club subscription. 3. Seek out Alphas who are absolutely not going to take one metric iota of your bullshit. 

Given your ~~sex-positive~~ slutty attitude, clear indication of a high cock count (judging from the fact that you're talking about sucking cock on an international newspaper's opinion web page), and post-wall age, you're going to be very hard pressed to find an Alpha willing to deal with even *that* much of your bullshit unless that blowjob you talked about is absolutely stellar. (I'm in the book. Seriously.)

**In Summary**

Seems like even feminists can't handle betas. If we needed any further evidence that women don't actually know what they want, I think we've found it here.

3pukuf,6,2015-10-22,"[Discussion] I can't figure out if I'm lazy or depressed, I just hate my life and I want to change it?",howtobeaccountable,GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/3pukuf/discussion_i_cant_figure_out_if_im_lazy_or/,"Reddit, I've hit a very low point in my life.  I've graduated recently with a 4 year degree in Biology.

It all started at the beginning of my 4th year.  I was having a total blast.  I was a bit worried about the future but I planned stuff out.  I was going to do a Master's in a biomedical field and then apply to medical school.  My GPA is pretty mediocre for medical school (3.74) and thought a Master's would definitely help.  I also loved biology and loaded up on as many courses as I can.  
I was quite late in getting an internship at a laboratory.  I worked there over the summer after 3rd.  I won't tell you what I did, as our lab is very specialized and I could easily be doxxed if I said so.  I had plenty of fun.  And then the school year started and the PI gave me the go-ahead for doing a full year course with him (I was no longer getting paid to be there, but, I would be receiving a credit).  My original supervisor who directly oversaw my worked was switched to another Post-doctoral fellow in my laboratory.  That's when everything went to hell.  
I did my best balancing working my part-time jobs over the weekend, my final year course load and the laboratory work.  My laboratory was located at a hospital about 20 KM away from my school campus.  And my own home was equidistance from both the hospital and my school at about 35 KM away.  The commute was quite tough but I enjoyed the lab until I switched over to the supervision of the post-doctoral fellow.  My work in the laboratory was often attacked as being really shit.  This fellow used to call me names when I would ask questions, saying things along the line of ""wow, that's a dumb question"", ""are you stupid"", ""don't they teach you that shit"".  I felt really bad and before long I felt very insecure about myself as person as a large part of my ego gravitated around research and academia.  I would often have weekly meetings, where I was scared of meeting her.  And a couple of occasions, I've had to hold back crying at how badly she used to rip me an asshole.  She would stare at me condescendingly as I held back the flood gates in my eyes, watering up as one or two tears form (it felt even worse knowing that society expects men to control these kinds of emotions).

""Are you fucking crying?"" she would ask.

I would turn away not making eye contact.  ""No.""

I finally approached the PI and quit.  I refrained from telling any of the departmental heads, professors or even the PI about my experience.  This fellow was the main producer of work in our lab, out-publishing everyone and bringing in the most money and as a lowly undergrad, I couldn't possibly go against her.  I wasted half a year of my final year and didn't even receive a credit (as I require to be at the laboratory for 1 full year).

Upon leaving the laboratory, my life felt an immediate weight lifted from my shoulder however my plan to do a Master's was utterly ruined.  I was afraid of labs :(  

I continued my life as per normal.  I graduated.  Continued to work parttime.  I couldn't possibly get into medicine with these scores of mine.  I wrote the MCAT recently and got my score back.  A 514 (PS/BIO/CP/CARS: 129/130/130/125), despite making it into the 91st percentile of testtakers, my CARS (verbal score) was mediocre.  I'm basically put into the same position.  I thought of the possibility of starting my own biotech company but I can't get around to it.  I feel unmotivated and shit.

I'm like the perfect caricature of a dead-beat son.  I live at home, spending the majority of time in the isolation of my basement, not helping out with chores as I hate them.  I rarely go outside except when I'm working.  I wake up at like 10 am everyday.  I often think of killing myself.  At the end of the day, I feel guilty for simply living at home with my parents and I see them do shit that normal adults do that I feel that society wants me to do.  On top of that, my dad is a very chill person which makes it even worse.  He doesn't even tell me anything or yells at me.  It makes me feel bad.  I always carried the hope of my parents being the son of immigrants in a new country.  I often tell him I'm stuck in life and just need a little time to figure things out and he agrees and is always offering advice.  They're not completely helpful as his generation and upbringing were blind to the concept of not being motivated or depressed.  If you either of those things during my father's time, you couldn't feed a family or yourself.  He also didn't complete school and is not very knowledgeable of the processes and intricacies of the social politics in academia.

I feel cynical and sad.  I stopped playing video games as I thought they were the source of my uselessness but my life still feels bad.  I rarely hang out with friends ever since I left university.  My social circle has decreased.  I stopped going to the gym.  I want a girlfriend but who wants to date a useless adult who still lives at home and has very little motivation.  I would simply be emotional baggage to a potential partner.  It's really bad right now.  If I wasn't so afraid of death and had easy access to CO, I would have likely killed myself.

I'm reaching out today because I want help.  I know I have some kind of problem and I don't want it to continue taking over my life as it has right now."
3pus1o,3,2015-10-22,I'm desperate...I want to live in Spain for a year(or longer) and learn Spanish. Please help me figure out how to accomplish this!,Spahrtan,travel,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/3pus1o/im_desperatei_want_to_live_in_spain_for_a_yearor/,"I am a single male from the United States. I recently graduated from university with a Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry. One of the top three things on my bucket list is to learn another language. Living in the United States, I think that Spanish would be the most beneficial. I also know that the best way to learn a language is to completely immerse yourself.

Ideally I would like to work in Spain for a year or longer (Perhaps Barcelona or Cartagena). I have researched about getting TEFL certified, but most testimonials and blogs seem like they're burning through money or barely breaking even. I'm not opposed to this, but I would prefer to have a job where I can continue to save a bit of money. If need be, I can live with not saving money for a year. Is TEFL and English teaching the best route?

I have two internships as well as a year of industry experience at a major polymer manufacturing plant doing research and development. In my head at least, this gives me quite a bit of human capital to get hired by a company. The major problem being that I don't speak a lick of Spanish (yet!). I'm also good with computers and have some basic programming skills under my belt, such as HTML, java, python, and ruby. In my high school and undergraduate days I've worked everywhere from restaurants waiting tables to sales of electronics.

I have traveled before as well. I have lived in Malta for a year(study abroad) and traveled to Italy, Rome, Holland, Denmark, Ireland, England, and Scotland. 

I'm very independent, motivated, and self-sufficient. I have enough savings to afford a plane ticket and a few months of unemployment. I guess what I'm trying to figure out is if you wonderful people have any suggestions on how I can accomplish one of my many dreams in life!

3pv4sk,4,2015-10-22,"Me [23/F] with my Coworker [34/M] of 1 year, sleeping together 11 months, not sure how to proceed.",oviedo_,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3pv4sk/me_23f_with_my_coworker_34m_of_1_year_sleeping/,"In my history you can read a post I had about a week after the initial hook up for a bit of a backstory, but here goes.  In October of 2014 I started an internship at a company in a city I had just moved to.  Being new to the city and not knowing very many people, I took an interest in my coworkers (small company, about 25 people), and inquired about events, fun activities, cool bars, etc.  One coworker in particular (i'll call him Nick) was really friendly and invited me to a few networking events.  Over the next month we become friendly, so when his out of town friend comes in for Thanksgiving break he invites me out saying he's going to set me up with his friend.  After a few tequila shots I end up staying in Nick's better rather than the out of town friend's.  We agree it's a bad idea, etc. etc and don't hook up nor hang out through the remainder of the holidays, but he does end up texting me and we flirt a little.

Returning to work in January, the flirty/sexual tension remains and we ended up hanging out/hooking up.  Since January we have hooked up 2-3x/month, with the most notable occasions being mutual (although separately planned) trips to the same out of state city, where we meet up and spend the night together, and then a different coworkers out of town wedding where we pre-arranged to stay in the same hotel room.  Additionally, I became full-time salaried in January.  Work (aside from the Nick situation) has had it's ups and downs, 10 people have either left or been fired in the time I've been there, and I don't see a lot of potential for growth for myself.  I have connections in larger firms which I will begin to explore in January, when have put in a full year.  This decision is not affected by Nick.

Outside of the weekend only hook ups, we've managed to remain professional and friendly coworkers in the office, with no slip ups or comments from other coworkers.  I feel it is important to genuinely state that I feel we operate two different relationships - those as coworkers and those as friends/hook up buddies. I cannot speak for him, but I have never used the way he has treated me outside of work in anyway within work, nor used the way he has treated me within work outside of work.  

However, the problem comes in the fact that I do like him at this point.  And a lot of the time I feel like he likes me. It's beginning to bother me that if for some reason I don't or won't see him in a certain weekend (for example, this weekend he is going out of town) I know that I won't get another chance to hang out with him until, at minimum, the next weekend.  Additionally, there is the issue of non-exclusivity (which neither of us has discussed), and which I didn't even really think about until another coworker was telling me about he went out with Nick one weekend and at the bar he relayed that ""Nick was so drunk, he was totally blowing it with this girl that he's been trying to get with for awhile."" That SUCKED to hear.  Then today I walked into the kitchen and someone had left their phone on the table - trying to figure out who's it was I clicked the unlock button and I see that there is a text from a girl who's name I recognized as being Nick's ex-girlfriend, saying ""thanks for being down for a Wednesday night movie!""  Dumbass doesn't have a passcode on it, so I can see that they've been talking for a little bit, albeit not full blown conversations, and not everyday.  I didn't get many details as I was in the open kitchen and had stepped into an emotional land mine.

I'm leaving out so many details which are not relative to the advice, but which I place a lot of emotional stock -- me having hung out with his brothers and their girlfriends a bunch of times, our similar senses of humor, the inside jokes, the meeting of his friends, etc.

So, I guess what I'm getting at is this: in his eyes am I, A) just a kid who's making it super easy for him to fuck me with no commitments? (Although I genuinely believe he does care about me as a friend)
B) Does he like me but feel like because we can't be together because of work there's no reason to say anything?
C) Just a dude who's gonna fuck as many people as he can manage?

The random chick I can handle.  I've slept with other guys throughout this time, although admittedly they didn't mean anything to me.  But the ex-girlfriend is different.  I don't know full details and there's just so much more to that kind of thing.

What I want to know is this:
- Do I tell him how I'm feeling?  That I know we can't be together but it's hard for me to only ""see"" him (in a genuine, not professional manner) only 2 or 3x per month (in a drinking setting?  That it makes me feel stupid and slutty that I'm just part of his rotation?  That if nothing else I just want to know if he thinks about me more than just late night weekends?

or should I keep quiet and get good sex until I move jobs and can have a cleaner break?

I KNOW that I want to tell him, but I also know that the reason I haven't said anything is because I'm afraid I'm not going to get the answer I want.

If you were me, what would you do?

3pvn0m,136,2015-10-23,My mom and stepfather [42 and 38] want to meet me[M18] for dinner after I left them for 6 months,RebornSpartan,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3pvn0m/my_mom_and_stepfather_42_and_38_want_to_meet/,"My plan was to wing this, I was going to ask my GF what she thinks of it, and then just jump into it but I think asking you guys might help calm me a bit. 


My mom married my stepdad 11 years ago. The whole deal, physical, ""mental"", and verbal abuse. I don't like talking about it over and over because I feel like i've read my own sob story, and everyone else's just a few too many times to be able to write out details and hear peoples apologies. That, and i'm embarrassed to share what's happening to me, more than i'm willing to admit. 

My mom married him, he was like that for 10 years until 6 months ago when I stood up for myself for the first time. I was fucking fed up. He called me and made me leave my Statistics final, (literally the last day of school) so he could use the car. Normally i'd ride my motorcycle but it was pouring pretty bad that day. I went home, and I could see he was already pissed off so that wasn't good for me, he was likely going to take it out on me. I don't want to get too into it, but I had the correct amount of fear and courage to not take his shit anymore. 

The whole world aligned for me that weekend. He had a business trip and was gone by the time I ran away, came back and changed out of my wet clothes, and went back to school and finished my final. I had been saving money from my weekend job + my joke of a graduation party + I just got a paid internship somewhere that would probably bring me $600ish cash a month part time. 

I skipped the graduation ceremony at school and looked for apartments on craigslist. I found a room out of a house for $400 flatrate and I was able to move in as soon as I paid him. I packed my clothes, my PC, got my cats litter box, and moved everything before the sun had set. I got my motorcycle, and then I disappeared. I didn't say goodbye to my mom, my stepbrother, to anyone. I was so sick of everything. The religion. Seeing my mom stand by and do nothing, and even participate.

Anyways, I opened up after a little while and talked to my mom from time to time since she would sometimes call me non stop. This was odd for me, because it was one of the first times I was able to talk to her and actually tell her how I felt. It started off rough, with her telling me I was an awful child and that I deserved everything that happened to me, and then it transitioned into her telling me she wanted to forget about it and that she wanted me to put my stepfather (who she's trying to force me to call my father, since now i'm able to call him my stepfather without getting hit for it) back into my life. I haven't talked to him outside of a text or two. Thing got more smooth with my mom over time, I would pick up once a week and tell her that i'm fine. If she tried to start an argument or have me talk to my stepdad, I would just hang up.

The remainder of ties to them: I paid for 75% of my motorcycle through work that I had done, I built and fixed 3D printers in town and I got some cash there, and mowing lawns and whatnot. Then my weekend job. My stepfather is in no way poor but he didn't like to spend very much on me, but he was able to get insurance on my bike for $14 a month, so he just pays that, and then the 25%of the bike that I couldn't pay. Theres that, and the fact that he put his name on the title of the motorcycle when I went to buy it. Probably because I was 16 at the time, which I suppose is understandable since I was a minor. I called my mom a few months ago asking her for the title, and she said she'll give me the title when I ""spend time with the family"". It was way too early for me to even consider that.

I really don't want to look at my stepfather ever again. I've *just* started to have nights where I wake up, and I don't remember any nightmares from my sleep. My scars don't burn as bad when I wake up anymore. I've had bones broken, tens of fake excuses for doctors, and i'm finally getting used to not having to put up with that anymore. 

Going to the point of this post, though; 

My mom called me earlier last week telling me she wanted to meet me for dinner with my stepdad and my stepbrother, for my birthday. I met my mom and my stepbrother last month for dinner, just the 2 of them, and that went nicely. I don't know if I ever want to see my stepdad again. She's giving me incentive though. She'll likely give me the title to my motorcycle, or something equivalent. Kind of funny how she remembers my birthday for the first time in 8 years when I leave the house and don't talk to her, isn't it?

Should I go? Should I pass? I don't know what to do. Tomorrow is my birthday. They want to have dinner, I told them I would never meet them anywhere unless it was public and I would choose the location, so my safety is taken into consideration here. I just don't know what else to factor in. 

Thank you in advance, if you have advice for me. 


   
**tl;dr**: Left abusive parents household for 5ish months, they want to meet for dinner despite me not wanting much to do with them. They're also giving me a lot of incentive, should I go?"
3pvqsh,4,2015-10-23,I'm sick of being in this rut.,atlasmade,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/3pvqsh/im_sick_of_being_in_this_rut/,"Sorry for the long post, wasn't sure if this even belongs here so I deleted it once and then realized this is something I need to get out, even if no one reads it.

Man, where to start. I feel so overwhelmed by everything that I can't find an answer to the question, whats the point? I've let nearly every healthy and productive aspect of my life slip away and can only sputter long enough to fake movement but never actually get anything going. So here it is.

School/career. - I'm a paper away from finishing law school but it's been on the back burner for two years now and it's become such an embarrassment for me to ask for help in getting it done. I had a really promising couple of internships but one was two years ago and I dropped the ball on the other one cause I've been depressed.  SUM: This paper is shaming me and I even if I get it done, the legal community is small and job prospects aren't promising.

Financials - haven't had a paying job in two years. I'll look up jobs and have a list with thirty and then say I'll apply later, and then by the time I get around to it they're gone. My student loans are in default I have no money in my bank account and I'm living at home.  Also in collections for some other credit card bills.
SUM: Even in the unlikely event I get a good job I'm going to be living like a pauper paying these things off.   

Personal life - Looks like I'm coming to the end of a toxic and co-dependent relationship which will be good in the long run. Bad news is, I grew up in a vary negative environment and she was very negative towards me, it felt familiar and I think thats fueled my depression. She just made contact with a guy she slept with during a break we had so I think that's about done. I worked really hard my first two and a half years of law school and ended up having a really lax last semester. The problem was that the days when I didn't have class,, I didn't have anything to do and I shut off. When I needed to turn back on I couldn't. The relationship basically isolated me from my friends, which is ironic because now many of the people who I had considered to be good friends now hang out with her more than me. I've let all those relationships fall away.  Most my friends are also from law school and people that I thought would always be in my corner have gone to hang out with her instead.   I feel they also judge me for not completing school, drinking and being a bum.

What I think is happening- I grew pretty poor and was regularly made fun of.  My solace as a kid was always believing that I would become a rich professional and show them.   Now I""m nearly thirty and living at home and the one narrative I've always had to comfort me is slipping away along with the rest of the life I had built.   I've accepted defeat and feel like when I'm trying to fix i'm just feigning it and going through the motions.  I think it might get better but I don't know how, and I know a lot of people look at me differently now.  

How this manifests itself - hard to get out of bed.  I have small projects to do at my dads that I could get done quickly but can't bring myself to do.  I end up on my computer or tv trying to zone out and escape.  I stay up till six in the morning cause i feel like this the only time I get thats mine without judgement.    Drinking always sounds good and numbs things for awhile.  I stay isolated and that only exacerbates things


What I would like to do:  Develop a tangible plan with reachable goals.  1) Job 2) Routine.  3) Mental/physical health (find a healthy outlet to talk) 4) redevelop friendship networks 5) figure out school/financial stuff.  6) ultimately pass the bar, get my own place.

Steps I've taken: Applied to several jobs, one of which I was supposed to start this week.  Lost my phone so they haven't gotten back to me, emailed them again,   thats about it really.  Drinking less, bt I really want a job, start reading, meditating, sleeping regularly again, being a normal person.  Look myself in the face again.  
Thanks if you read all this

TLDR: Fell into a rut and ruined personal and financial relationships, mental health gone to the wayside."
3pvryz,3,2015-10-23,Fear and self-loathing in Las Vegas,Thisposable_account,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3pvryz/fear_and_selfloathing_in_las_vegas/,"Sorry about the wall of text, I didn't plan on writing this much.

I don't even know where to begin. I feel like I'm the spectator of my own life. And not even a nice one, the kind of spectators that always make crappy comments.

I have no idea of what I'm supposed to do or be. In 6 months, I'm supposed to have finished my studies, get an internship, a job and be an overall adult. It fucking terrifies me. But that's not the worst part.

I am lonely. I have friends I see and people I know, and even a family that supports me, but I haven't really spoken to anyone about me, or the way I feel, in almost a year now.

That was when I finally broke down at my sister's birthday, told her about my cheating girlfriend and built up the courage to dump her. I've always had trust issues, but the fact that she cheated on me with several friends of mine just destroyed me. I always feel like people are mocking me or talking shit about me behind my back, and I obviously have no way to find out.

I didn't even have the balls to dump her when I found out, I just decided not to care. Or at least to tell myself I didn't care. Finally, the pressure was too much to handle, and I left her and the ""friends"" that I used to have. It helps that I'm studying away from my hometown.

It has been a year now, and not caring is the attitude I now apply to almost everything. I don't speak about myself  or how I feel to anyone, because I'm afraid they will talk about it with others and mock me.

My only answer to this whole situation is to be ""the funny guy"". This way, I know people may want me around, or at least that I can have something to offer them. That solves the part of ""Am I bothering these people or do they really want to talk to me ?"".

Then, it helps talking to people without committing or giving any information. I can talk about a show, a movie or anything that has humour in it, or comment on the ongoing situation. I have been told to be pretty funny, so it's always nice to know you're good at something. But that's almost the only thing I do to communicate, and I know it's not healthy. I have a lot on my plate and I should talk about it to someone, but I just can't.

6 years ago, I tried to kill myself, and I had to undergo therapy session with a psychiatrist. It lasted for approximately a year and a half, and I came out better. I got a girlfriend, started getting along with friends and living an overall normal life. My parents were really happy to see that I was better, and it helped me move on. My grades were good enough to get into a nice university, and everything was pretty muck ok.

That is until 2 years ago, when I found out my then gf was cheating on me, and I started the Not Caring Program in 1 step.

Another thing, my now best friend (post cheating shitstorm) is a really attractive dude, and I always feel like I live in his shadow. Don't get me wrong, he is an awesome guy, and he's not doing anything to make me feel this way, he is just so much more confident than I am. Therefore, when we are somewhere talking to people, especially women, I always feel like I am there because people want him around, I'm just included in the package.

We used to be flat mates, along with 2 other friends, so we basically know the same people, and whenever he is there (he lives about 2h away for an internship) we go everywhere together. Oh btw now that he is gone, the 2 other guys took another flat together and replaced me with one of their friends, which doesn't help me feel valuated. I can't blame them though, I was a pretty shitty roommate and spent a lot of time sleeping or locked in my room.

I have also had a crush on a girl for now almost a year, but she is a really good friend of mine, and I know I can't date her. I know what I'm worth relationship-wise, how closed I am and I know I can't keep a relationship afloat by just joking around 24/7. I know she deserves better and I really think it would ""destroy our friendship"" (insert cliché comment here).

Now the thing is, even if I know all of this, I can't help to hope that somehow I could change or this could work. I don't act on it though, because I usually sober up before and because, let's face it, I'm a bit of a pussy.

That's why when I saw my best friend kissing her, it hit pretty deep. Everything came back. All along, when I thought they were happy having me around, were they just waiting for me to leave ? I know I've already done this to him, and I cockblocked him at least once. I only realized it later and felt like shit because I thought we were all having a good time whereas I was just ""this guy"".

There's this guy that always follows us (the people I usually hang out with) around and that no one really appreciates. He is pretty nice, sweet, and not mean at all, but he is not really interesting and speaks too loud. They always make fun of him behind his back for being this way, and I am really uncomfortable about it because I feel like they could do the same about me. Oh, and because that's pretty much a shitty attitude, but I'm more bothered about my own person. Great guy, right ? 

So now my pretty much only 2 real friends are possibly getting in a relationship, and there is almost no situation where I will feel wanted. I already gave my guy friend a ""safeword"" for when he wants me to leave him alone with someone, but he only used it once so I think he doesn't want to hurt me. I am going away to my hometown for a week, so I won't see them, but I have no idea of how to deal with this when I get back. They are pretty much the things that helped me stay strong, and meet people, and now I can only see a future where they will be drifting away from me.

I know this sounds like a pathetic 16 years old whose problems are 80% high school drama, but I'm just 23 and tired. I think typing this helped me a little bit, so thanks to this sub.

I am on my third year of university in computer sciences, and I need to find an internship for the end of the year. I'd like to find it in real time computer graphics. I've read a lot of this subreddit posts, and it seems like it is impossible. However, I'd still like to try to send some CV's. Before that, I'd like to know what kind of projects/experience a common company wants to see. ( I am interested for answers even if this is for a first job and not an internship )

So I have a basic understanding of the pipeline stages, matrices, vectors and common operations. I know how to produce basics effects you can see in tutorials : shadows, normal mapping, reflection, skinned animations.
I have a little experience with procedural generation, I can generate basics heightmaps, planets, textures, however it's not looking that great.

The problem is that I don't have any project to show, if they ask me ""hey show me some projects you did?"", I don't think they are gonna be satisfied with one mesh + shader demos. I often tried bigger scenes, but I was always stuck with assets.

What should I do? More importantly what should I show them? Bigger project ( by that I just mean a scene containing some effects I've working on, and try to render it the best I can ) ? More advanced effects?

If you have already interviewed some people for graphics position, how would you select them?

Thanks."

3px0up,14,2015-10-23,Why Does my GERD/Anxiety make me feel something's wrong with my heart when I know it isn't?,IcarusTheSatellite,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/3px0up/why_does_my_gerdanxiety_make_me_feel_somethings/,"Hello Anxiety: I crossed this post with AskDos. Ahead of time I'd like to apologize for the length of this post. I'd really appreciate it if you read it in it's entirety but if not that's fine too. Essentially, my question for you is why does my GERD/anxiety make me feel something's wrong with my heart when I know it isn't?

I'm a white 25 y/o male, 6'0'' and 180 lbs. I live in a middle to upper middle class neighborhood of a major American city on the East Coast. I've never used drugs but drink a beer after work occasionally or with colleagues, maybe about 4-5 drinks a week but rarely get drunk or drink more than 1 or 2 in a sitting. My resting heart rate is in the low 60's and I've been told my blood pressure is excellent by docs, but the exact number escapes me. I'm an active runner (30 miles a week) and a former professional athlete (played single A minor league baseball for a year) who other than my anxiety and infrequent GERD doesn't have any medical issues. Looking back in hindsight, I've always been an anxious person, but over small things. I would check the stove every night, check the locks, count my steps from time to time. Why would I count the steps? I really don't know honestly, it just made me feel better when I did and would help calm my mind down when it felt like it was swirling. It never really caused me any worry in youth, I just thought it was the way I was. It doesn't help that my mom and grandmother both had nervous breakdowns and have had several uncles who dealt with extreme nervousness. Genetics I guess.

My condition so to speak started 5 years ago my junior year of college right around exams. I was always a very hard worker. I doubled majored in college, started 4 years on the baseball team, held a 25 hour weekly retail job, and was the president of the political science honors society. Late one night around exams, I was eating a cheeseburger and seemingly out of nowhere, it felt like I had difficulty swallowing and my chest was on fire. My heart felt like it was doing somersaults in my chest. Panicking, I drove to the ER (probably a bad idea) and doctors ran some tests and quickly determined there was nothing gravely wrong with me and that I had GERD from the poor food I was eating and the stress. I was given an omeprazole subscription, changed my eating habits, and after a month or 2, my GERD completely went away as did my anxiety. 

My GERD (and for the most part) anxiety were absent from the end of my junior year, through my senior year, and through my year playing professional baseball. While playing A ball, I realized that maybe I wasn't going to cut it playing baseball forever so I took my GRE's and enrolled in a very competitive PolySci master's program. 

Unfortunately, my MA program was much different experience than my BA was. I came from a good, stable loving home but my parents never had any money and weren't able to help out in any significant way. Luckily, between my baseball scholarship and 2 academic scholarships, my BA was completely covered. My MA however was not. About halfway through my first semester in, I was running on fumes. I would get up every morning at 6 AM, run my 5 miles, go to work at a political strategy consulting internship from 8:30-5PM, eat a quick dinner, go to night class from 6-9. Then get up the next day and do it again. On weekends, I worked 10 hour shifts back to back days to pay the bills/ cover my expenses.

 I was managing it well or so I thought, until one day in mid October 2013 sitting in a lecture I got the feeling again. My heart doing somersaults/fluttering, my mind racing, my palms drenched in sweat, my legs filling up with blood, my mind telling me to start running. I would start hyperventilating and feel dizzy. Where? I don't know but I knew I just needed to run. I collected myself (no idea how) and walked calmly to the bathroom and splashed my face with water. Just as quickly as it felt like the world was crumbling around me, the feeling went away and I was fine. Now at this point I'm freaking the fuck out. I don't know what's going on and I'm starting to come back down. I start to get a feeling that things aren't real, like I'm ""floating"". Scariest fucking thing ever. I never go back to class and just drive to Urgent Care. After some tests and going over my history, I get diagnosed with panic attacks and GERD again as well. I was given Xanax and omeprazole again. 

If I thought my compulsions were bad before, they had just become 1000000x worse. It's like if someone flipped a switch in my brain. Now I began to continuosly check my pulse. Randomly and all the time. On runs I would stop and put 2 fingers to my neck or wrist to see if my heart rate was ""normal"" (like as if I had any clue what normal would feel like?) In class I would check, hate myself for checking and tell myself to not check, then start to freak out something was wrong and have to check, then hate myself for checking. The idea of having another panic attack was all consuming. I wanted to avoid anything and everything that could possibly give me a panic attack. This seems funny now, but at one point I realized I was wearing the same pair of underwear 2 separate occasions I had a panic attack so I consciously decided not to wear that underwear, as if that was the underlying cause of my anxiety haha. I continued to have panic attacks regularly over the next few months in varying intensity. I always found out the times I was most stressed out I had the greatest amount of stomach discomfort/chest discomfort/reflux.  

The worst part was the smallest thing would set me off. I mean, I was a professional athlete, played football and baseball at high levels, and am an active runner. I've gotten more physicals and examinations for sports than most people have ever thought possible, I know I'm healthy! But I would see something on the news or TV like ""Tennis star collapses and dies playing tennis; underlying heart condition cause"" and I started thinking to my HOLY SHIT THAT'S ME. I HAVE A HEART CONDITION. THAT'S WHAT THIS ALL IS. I'M DYING THAT'S IT THIS IS THE END. Those would be the precursors to the largest of all panic attacks. In the spring of 2014, Rich Peverely, a forward for the Dallas Stars, collapsed during a game and was rushed to the hospital due to his heart stopping. I obsessed over that clip and was seemingly in my mind all the time. I was sure something like that was going to happen to me and that that was the reason why my chest felt the way it did.

Almost needless to say, I spent many times going to my primary care doc. From October 2013-May 2015, I've been to my doctor's office at least 5 times. Each time the doctor listens to me, listens to my heart and tell me my heart is perfectly fine, I don't have an irregular heart beat, I'm not dying, etc. One of the first times I was given a heart rate test in office which showed my heart was fine. I wore a heart rate monitor for a few weeks and it showed no abnormalities. This reassurance helped a lot for my stress/ anxiety. 

Fast forward to today, my panic attacks are (almost) completely gone. If I ever feel one coming on, I'm able to stay calm through deep breathing and avoid hyperventilating and the anxiety passes. The GERD is still present infrequently, especially when I drink too much or am stressed, but it's manageable. I no longer take omeprazole or any kind of anxiety meds. I take tums every once in a while. Running has been a huge help. When I'm feeling totally stressed or anxious, running usually pushes it all away but it's kind of a double edged sword because when I push myself too hard by running, it causes my GERD to flare up which sucks. 

After all that huge mess of rambling, 2 years later and I feel better. Not 100% but much better than what I was. I have my degree, got employed right away as a Political Analyst, make a sizable salary for my age, and work 45-50 hours a week. Every now and then though, if I eat a donut or drink a coffee too early or eat a spicy lunch or am too stressed, I get that feeling in my chest. The my heart is fluttering/somersaults feeling. It's usually just for a second or two and passes and happens very infrequently, but when it does, it just throws my whole day and I ruminate about. I instantly revert to checking my pulse. It can lead to greater anxiety unless I cut it off. Now I've been to the doctor and they've told me everything's fine with my heart and I believe them (they know much more about medicine than I do/ ever will) but I still don't know why? Why does it feel as if my heartbeat is irregular/having heart failure if everything is perfectly fine? Or is it just all in my head? Any and all help would be greatly appreciated, thanks."

My bf and I have a great life together; he is sweet and respectful, we live together, things are going okay. However he's having a hard time coming to terms with where his life is turning out and I don't know how to help him. I feel like I'm not a good listener - I'm bad at telling people what they want/need to hear. 

Some background, I have a degree and work at a semi-decent job in tech (QA) and come from a wealthy family. He has no degree, worked in a dead end field for 5 years (still does) and recently picked up a second job as a medical scheduler to get some much needed experience. He's been coming to terms with that his long-term goals aren't panning out and he's frustrated with having to work two jobs with very little sleep, debt, and low pay. It takes him ~60-65 hours a week to make the same amount as I make in a 45 hour week. It's tough being in your late 20s and realizing you can't have as much ""fun"" as you once did, responsibilities, etc, and he's often feeling sorry for himself, and tired of it all.

He doesn't come from much financially, and can't see beyond his frustration at the current circumstances. He has no work experience in anything other than restaurant work and a few months at this medical office - while I was working at unpaid internships in my early 20s he was working as a bartender. He's seeing now that most likely he will be in this situation working long hours for not a lot of pay for a while into the future until he can get experience and earn enough to get by on one income. This realization plus the lack of sleep is taking a huge toll on him and our relationship.

The problem is as much as I want to help him, it doesn't seem to work. I try to suggest ways to make the situation better (sending resumes out, changing jobs, having fun during our shared time off)...but I don't think suggesting ways to ""fix"" it is working. I've always had trouble being a shoulder to cry on for people because my mind immediately jumps to ""okay how to we fix this situation and make it better"" rather than empathizing. Right now all he feels is frustrated, hopeless, and run down. How can I help? How can I listen and be supportive while he's having this crisis? What do I do as a partner to make both our lives a little easier?



   
**tl;dr**: BF is burnt out on two jobs and no money. Attitude is affecting our relationship and I don't know how to help."
3pxuya,0,2015-10-23,"A few years ago, I devised a plan to work for Rooster Teeth",Dexter_Oats,roosterteeth,https://www.reddit.com/r/roosterteeth/comments/3pxuya/a_few_years_ago_i_devised_a_plan_to_work_for/,"I apologize in advance for the length of this post.

So, before I begin, let me give you a bit of introduction. I'm an aspiring screenwriter straight out of college, but more importantly, I'm a Rooster Teeth fan, and I have been since the Blood Gulch Chronicles. 

Through the years, I consumed all Rooster Teeth content and thought of them the same way someone might think of their favorite band. I never thought of Rooster Teeth as someone who I might want to work for. But when I started college, I started paying more attention to Rooster Teeth's relationship with their community. I didn't see it as an “artist and fan” relationship, but as (and as cheesy as it may sound) a family. Rooster Teeth and their fans are so connected with each other, we all seem like just a bunch of buddies huddled together. That's when I changed my goal. Forget about Hollywood and the Oscars; if I'm going to be a screenwriter, it's going to be for Rooster Teeth.

But how am I going to get there? Well, I looked at some of the RT staff and I realized that a lot of them were hand-picked from their own community or contacted by Rooster Teeth because they saw some of the stuff they've created on the internet. Monty and Michael are just a couple of examples. Earlier this year, an animator named Dillon Gu was hired to work on RWBY because of his really awesome “Project Monty.”

The question now was, “How was I going to impress Rooster Teeth with my screenwriting skills?” I was in college when I first started constructing this plan. It was just before RWBY Vol. 1 had begun.  I decided to put all of my efforts into one big attempt at getting Rooster Teeth's attention. This was the plan I came up with:

I would write a feature-length screenplay and make it the best screenplay it could ever be. But, at the same time, I would cram as many Rooster Teeth references as I could into it, and scatter the references throughout the script. However, the references had to be subtle enough for the script to make sense to non-RT fans, but abundant enough for any RT fan to know that it can't just be a coincidence. See, the screenplay would act as my resume or my portfolio that I'd use to show what I can do. The references act as a flare that is meant to get the attention of Rooster Teeth specifically. After that had been completed, I go through the normal process of getting a screenplay produced: get an agent, sell it to a producer, and so on. From this point, a lot of things could happen. Worst case scenario, it doesn't get produced at all, and the plan fails. But let's say the movie went to theaters or straight to Netflix or something. During the writing process, I would have titled the movie as a subtle RT reference to get the attention of at least one RT fan (the title I ended up with was Red vs. Red). It would only need to take one RT fan to be curious about the title enough to watch the movie and recognize the intentional RT references. Then this RT fan would jump online to the RT site or Reddit or something and tell all the other RT fans about this Rooster Teeth-reference-filled movie. From there, it gains more and more attention, and eventually, a Rooster Teeth staff member would take notice. That's when I jump out of the shadows and reveal myself. “Ah-ha! It was I! I wrote that script!” I'd probably say something like that. 

After that, a lot more things could go wrong. Everyone could just say “Oh, that's cool,” and move on with their lives, and the plan fails. Or preferably, Rooster Teeth might contact me and ask me to intern for them or something. From there, I could prove myself and work my way up to writer the way Miles did. Then the plan works. That was my plan. Was. 

Here's what actually happened:

I began my first attempt at the plan and wrote the first seventeen pages. I had my screenwriting professor look at them and pointed out holes in my screenwriting skills in general. After about a year of trying to get it right, I gave up and decided to focus on school. Then a few years passed. It is now February of 2015, and I find out the person who I respected and looked up to the most in this world has passed away. People passed around one of his quotes which stuck with me: “Keep moving forward.” At that moment, I decided not to waste any more time. I picked up that old idea I had and applied it to a brand new premise. After I graduated last May, I quit my job and started writing. Everything was going well, but then I got impatient. I chose four film festivals and screenwriting competitions that I could submit my screenplay to (a step that could get my script the attention of better producers to increase the likelihood of it getting made), and this set an unrealistic deadline on myself to hurry myself up. The deadline for these competitions all fell on August 30th. On the 29th, I rushed myself and finished what was only my second draft. After only skimming through the script once, I sent it off to the competitions. But after that, I actually sat down and read what I just sent off into the world. Good lord. What a broken piece of shit. 

So I sat back down and rewrote it again. No deadlines this time; I wanted to focus on quality. When I finished, I reread it again and again, made my corrections, reread it again, and now I think it's done. I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. But why am I posting about this now? Well, a few reasons: The first is just because I wanted to share it with any other Rooster Teeth fan before I sent it off to more festivals. The second is because in a recent podcast, they talked about how Lazer Team had Rooster Teeth references scattered throughout it as well, and since I'm dumb and paranoid, I was afraid another fan might get the same idea and do it before me. I'm not even sure if it's a good plan anymore, but it works in my head.

So that's it. I'll post my latest draft of the screenplay below if anyone is bored or curious. My official count was 71 total Rooster Teeth references. The title counts as one reference. Each of the characters names count as one reference when they're first introduced. There are a couple references that might be a little too subtle, like the word “grim” which is supposed to be a reference to the “Grimm.” 

What if my plan fails? I'll try again. There's nothing else I want more in the world. I want Rooster Teeth-senpai to notice me and I want Miles and Kerry to take me under their wings. If you made it this far, thanks for reading.

Tl;dr: I wanted to work for Rooster Teeth, so I wrote a feature-length screenplay and filled it with 71 RT references in hopes that Rooster Teeth would notice.

Here's the script: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3x0a1KAf1dgdGFHWXRTemJuRUE/view?usp=sharing

I'm going to send it off to more competitions soon. Wish me luck!
Also, I encourage any constructive criticism on both the plan and the screenplay itself. Just please be gentle.

EDIT: I should probably clarify something since a couple people have brought it up. The references I hid throughout the script aren't jokes used in past Rooster Teeth videos. The premise I used is original, the jokes I used were original, the plot I used was (for the most part) original. This script can stand on its own without the references. The references have no major (or minor, for that matter) affect on the script itself. And also, I'm not trying to get this screenplay produced by Rooster Teeth. I'm aiming to get this produced by someone else, then once its made, it's something that I can add to my portfolio that just so happens to have references to Rooster Teeth."

I'm 24, graduating in December, turning 25 and getting married in January, and already have a job lined up. We will have ~65k in student loans (30k at 3%, 35k at 10%) between the two of us, and absolutely no credit card debt. I will be making ~63k starting in January (tech field, its in writing). My spouse will have one semester of college left. Once she graduates she can expect to make in the mid 30k range.


We currently have one car and my spouse will need the car to go to school and her internship. She may be able to bring in income with a part time job (6k/year). I will need a car to go to work. Because of the wedding (small and simple, spending &lt;5k) we will have very little cash on hand. Maybe enough to cover the down payment on a certified pre-owned car (2k). Additionally, family cannot help because of unfortunate circumstances. 


Is it a bad idea to buy a CPO car on credit at this point in time? I'm a car guy and I know most cars in the &lt;2k range will need repairs and maintenance that we don't have the cash for. I am looking at cars in the 15k-17k range that would be reliable and last a long time. I have good-excellent credit in the mid to low 730s. She has okay credit in the low 600s. I think I would qualify for the current rate of 1.99% or 2.99%APR on 60 or 72 months. Ideally we would pay it off much quicker than that, once she starts bringing in post graduation income. 


Expenses wise, we expect rent to be in the 1200 range, and we are already used to being frugal by eating in most of the time, and we are not the bar hopping/partying type. We dont wan't cable, and have a simple cell phone plan. Additionally we don't expect to bump up our quality of living just because I have a new job. There are many other expenses we've budgeted for, but I didn't want to list them all out. It seems we could afford it, but I am wondering if I'm overlooking a better option. Let me know if you have any questions.


Thank you for the help!

3pyjk1,10,2015-10-23,I [25F] just had a friendship blowout with my former friend/mentor [60M]. Re-evaluated it and now I am freaking out about how controlling that relationship was. Would appreciate perspectives.,andanandroid,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3pyjk1/i_25f_just_had_a_friendship_blowout_with_my/,"TL;DR Former best friend and role model blew up at me and I cut him off. Reconsidering our relationship it turns out to be controlling and toxic. My mind is fucked. Please help me understand.

This is such a weird situation I cannot wrap my head around it. 4 years ago when I was 21 I went through a low point in my academic life. That was when I met Mark, a teacher at my small private college. I was feeling lost with the major I had chosen and Mark was a great and very dedicated teacher. I was very enamored of his teaching style and we had great success. I found my passion within my major.

After that quarter ended I decided to hit Mark up for an internship as I enjoyed his teaching style very much and figured there was a lot more I could learn from him. Mark took me on as a research assistant and we worked on a great many projects, often speaking as equals. Mark has always been very concerned for my future and had great hopes for me to succeed in the field where he had not had much professional success. He is quite bitter about what he perceives about his had career choices that led to him have ""wasted his life"" and not fulfilled the potentials he had been told about when he was in graduate school.

A year after working with Mark our relationship became extremely close. I was completely in love with him and totally devoted in a pretty scary way. I have always felt insecure about myself and have craved acknowledgement and acceptance and Mark provided that in spades. I would have done anything for him. We started sleeping together. I wanted something more like a relationship but Mark told me he did not believe in relationships. So instead we slept together, on his terms. However I felt very unfulfilled and in fact positively miserable from that arrangement and so I ended it a year after we started.

However in that time, Mark and I saw each other constantly and worked together constantly. We we're both workaholics. He had convinced me that absolute devotion to work is necessary to be successful and encouraged the intensity with which we worked and saw each other. He himself had disavowed relationships and other ""normal"" elements of life to dedicate himself to work, which he sometimes lamented. Although he never insisted I do the same, it was clear he wanted me to have the same ethic.

I also got wrapped up in Mark's personal life. He is socially awkward (possibly having mild Asperger's) and very bad at working with other people which he is aware of. His work relationships constantly soured. He believes he is very gifted at his work (having been told this by people in the past and indeed he is quite a deep thinker) and thus is above everyone else. He hated it when his staff did not follow his instructions. In fact he admitted that basically he would like to have a team of people like me, who were devoted to him, good thinkers and with insane dedication to the project. He probably was not a good communicator at work, and constantly complained to me that his genius is not recognized, members of his team are poisoning the others against him, he feels isolated and so on. His work environment definitely was not ideal for his creative work but it seemed to me that surely it couldn't always be the others' fault? I had to bail Mark out on projects several times because he couldn't cooperate with his team enough to meet deadlines - which he blamed them for.

Mark has always explained his lack of success as a combination of unrecognized genius in a bad work environment, coming from a poor background, and lack of social awareness. It is very hard for me to evaluate his claims as I don't have the skills to judge his work, I've only heard about his work environment from him though it does seem quite toxic. So I don't know what to make of it.

Over the years Mark has also tried to pass on his world view to me. In addition to the crazy dedication to work, he insinuates that I will only succeed if I have a partner who is intellectual and understands me perfectly. In this ideal reality, the partner and I will spur each other on, start a company together and achieve great professional success. This is very obviously a projection of his own unfulfilled desires onto me. He disapproved passive aggressively every guy I dated, feeling that no one was good enough for me. No one will ever be good enough for me except a younger clone of himself basically. He literally wrote me a list of ""acceptable"" boyfriend typed He would approve of. He would be dismissive and quite insulting of my boyfriends, upsetting me. I went on with my life anyway but he introduced so many anxieties into my life thinking that I am wasting my life away.

Mark talks about himself a lot. At first it was very fascinating as he has had a crazy life story and a lot of diverse life experience. However he never stops talking about himself and can channel any conversation topic into something about him. He acknowledges this tendency and attributes it to his potential Aspergers. He even managed to make the death of my father about himself.

The gist of my relationship with Mark is that he fantasizes about an ideal life he could have led, and projects that into me, approving and disapproving accordingly. He would get jealous and upset over other bosses I intern for, insulting their work. He also insults passive aggressively my current boyfriend whom he doesn't think is good enough. My boyfriend is an amazingly sweet guy, stable and caring, and my emotional rock.

This all came to a head two days ago. I showed Mark some of my recent work at graduate school (I'm going to school in a state far away) and he absolutely TRASHED it. In the most disrespectful and insulting manner. He told me to stop showing him crap, said my professor is obviously not making any headway with his class direction, and I should have more honesty and integrity with what I do.

I was FLOORED by this insane outburst. He had been upset at me before but this takes the cake. I responded that I was shocked at how rude he was and how uncalled for and judgmental he was being. For the record the project was very well received at my presentation and the work of my class is considered very interesting. I pointed out that he feels there is only one way of doing things (his way) and he is just trashing everything else without considering it, or just working with impressions (as opposed to actual understanding) in order to put it down. He denied being accusatory and condescending. I eventually told him I was appalled and need space away from this.

Since then he has apologized but I feel that he does not realize why I am upset. I feel no inclination to forgive him and talk to him again. He took advantage of the fact that I look up to him in order to ""put me in my place"". I was deviating too much from his ideal vision of me and he had to shake me out of it. Too bad that backfired on him and he lost his one close friend.

Unpacking and going over this with my best friends led me to the revelations about his behaviour all these years. It's kind of crazy because what I thought was the best thing in my life starts to appear like an abusive relationship?? I am so confused.

What makes it harder to wrap my head around is that Mark is not malicious. I genuinely believe he wants the best for me, and in fact he helped me very much professionally and wrote glowingly of me when I applied to this very good graduate school that I am studying at right now. He does want the best for me...but the best as defined by his worldview and if I behaved like what he wishes he could have been like. I started distancing and changing and he freaked out and blew up at me. He is a...benevolent controller?

We also shared many good times together, long conversations stretching into the night (mostly about him), urban exploration that we both enjoy, exercise and diet discussions. He encourages me a lot, assures me I am smart and have the potential for success, likes for me to get out and see the world.

I am sorry about this long rambling post. My thoughts are a little disorganized as I'm trying to apprehend this matter still. I would appreciate any advice, perspectives and any personal experiences.

   
TL;DR Former best friend and role model blew up at me and I cut him off. Reconsidering our relationship it turns out to be controlling and toxic. My mind is fucked."

So I've made the switch to HR (it's just something I've always wanted and I feel this is the right path for my life). I currently work as an Administrative Assistant for a Mental Health facility. I have experience in QuickBooks, Excel, time sheets, payroll, invoicing, billing/coding, hiring, talent management, HIPPA training, etc. I've been applying to some HR Assistant positions but it seems like they all want some HR experience. Should I intern? It would be a Virtual Internship (roughly about 10-15 hours a week). Yes, my weeks would be busy and hectic (studying 15-20 hours a week, working 40 hrs a week and interning 15 hours a week). What do you think? "

Cersei Lannister: I'd love to play a guard that she takes a liking to and is actually able to 'make' her do things that she wouldn't normally. She likes his assertiveness and the fact that he is unafraid to tell the queen to bend over like a common whore, or get on her knees and swallow no matter how little she cares to do so.

Daenerys: For her, I'd love to play someone that can take her away from her 'Queenly' state and make her feel like a dirty young girl again. Whether that's one of her closest bodyguards, a trusted adviser, or a soldier for her army..... or maybe she gives her body up as a prize to a much needed ally perhaps?

Shae: After all that she did? I just want to treat her like a whore at the whorehouse.... Is that so much to ask?

Others: Arya Stark, Catelyn Stark, Margaery Tyrell

---House of Lies---

Jeannie: Obvious one here, but I'd play almost anyone against her in some fashion. A new boyfriend that is truly her baby daddy... A past fling coming back in to her life and wooing her .... A booty call on a business trip that turns in to something slightly more serious.... Etc etc!

Monica: She needs a nice young stud to keep her busy, doesn't she? I'm thinking an intern that she tries to belittle and finally wants to ease a bit of tension and then realizes just how big of a boy he is ... and it draws her to him more and more even if they really don't get along on a personal level.

Others: April, Sarah Guggenheim, Marisa McClintock, Brynn

---The Office---

Pam Beesley: Something without Jim would be fantastic. Whether she's desperate at her apartment after breaking up with Roy that she'll give herself up to the landlord for more time/lesser rent... Maybe she's lonely and lets a warehouse guy take her for a ride that she can't help but want to relive on a nearly daily basis? Or an intern that she catches taking a liking to her and who knows where they go from there!

Jan: Another cougar that needs a young man. She's shown many times over that she loves interns and younger men in general!

Erin: Someone very dominate for her since she seems to be unsure/innocent... and she needs somebody that can break her of that streak.

Kelly: I have a feeling that she'd use just about anyone to make Ryan jealous. Let's give her a new person to do just that with. We can figure out if he's a perfect fit for her or just a guy with a dick that can shut her up for a few minutes at a time while they do some dirty things with one another!

Others: Angela, Meredith, Holly Flax....

Feel free to toss almost anyone else at me too as I'm sure I've missed some! Looking for something potentially long-term but I'm more then happy with just doing one scene if you'd rather go that route!

3pz6z8,1,2015-10-23,Brazilian social media is reacting to pedophilia in a very incisive way,offmybrazillianchest,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3pz6z8/brazilian_social_media_is_reacting_to_pedophilia/,"Social media in Brazil has been taken by the awful fact that in the premiere of our Master Chef Jr local twitters were commenting about a 12 yo girl as if she was a playboy centerfold.

This got media attention, everyone (including the judiciary system) is looking for those assholes and as a sort of cry for help / validation / counter reaction against everyone that said ""those guys were just joking about having sex with a 12yo"" someone started a #fisrtharassment hashtag (#primeiroassedio).

My own first harassment was a guy touching me everywhere he felt like, under my school bag, to which I as clinging so hard because I was riding the bus and I didn't want to forget anything in the bus in my first year going home alone in the 30' ride. I was 12.

I never forgotten that but the social media this week kinda threw every little aggression I and every other woman ever dealt with as a girl in our faces. 

I never thought about as such a big deal but I've been sad for the past few days as I remember everything at once and as I feel violated by every guy jerking off in the bus while I as an intern (15-18) I feel like I should be glad that I was never raped. That is not an acceptable feeling but I'm so down, so vulnerable, that i can write that it is wrong but i'm so sad that I cant actually mean them. 

Worst of all, some dudes are commenting on twiiter about the hashtag saying: ""go on, i'm masturbating to that"""
3pz96d,2,2015-10-23,Quitting drugs: What to expect?,HorseDickBrah,Drugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/3pz96d/quitting_drugs_what_to_expect/,"I'm 22, a senior in college now, and oh boy, I have a good run with drugs in the last 4 years without even realizing it.  After getting kicked out of college ultimately because of being a drug addict, i eventually got back into my university and am getting excellent grades in all my classes now. I just got an internship as well.  

Problem is, while I definitely prioritize things appropriately in my life now, and things have been getting better, I realize I haven't ever really stopped being a drug addict.  

18 y/o: I was smoking pot every day, drinking like 3 times a week at least to the point of blacking out a lot of the times.

19: I was introduced to adderall, and used that to drink more and party harder and longer.  I was drinking even more at this point, like a beer or two during the week, and getting blacked out on weekends as usual.

20: I had a major anxiety attack from a bad shroom trip, and decided to cease all drug use for a while, with the exception of alcohol on the weekends.  Any stimulant or psychedelic would give me a huge panic attack, and I developed hypochondria and would occasionally get panic attacks just for no reason.  

21: The residual effects: the chronic derealization, anxiety, and depression I was experiencing from that bad shroom trip were really starting to get to me.  At this point in my life I was kicked out of my university, working 15 hours a week on minimum wage, and just so depressed.  This is when I had the bright idea of taking xanax to self medicate.  And BOOM. Anxiety, gone. Derealization, gone. Depression, gone. I felt NORMAL again and I loved it.  I almost felt BETTER than normal actually. I was always a quiet introverted person, and was very socially awkward.  I always spent a lot of time in my own head, and had lacked the ability to produce clear thoughts and articulate them confidently and coherently.  The xanax seemed to just fix all that.   I would continue to try and dose ""responsibly"" for this entire year of my life, taking maybe 0.5mg a day for a week or two and then stop for a week or two, and then go back on. Naturally these doses started increasing over time, and before I knew it, I realized I certainly have a problem.  By the end of the year I was taking an average of 15-20 xanax bars a month, with all doses taken sporadically throughout the month. Some days I wouldn't take any xanax, others I would take 2mg, and every once in a blue moon I would take 6 mg just because i was bored.  I got back into smoking weed on a daily basis, as I felt Id mentally recovered from that bad shroom trip quite a bit.  I was also taking adderall a couple times a month, but I never went back to that addict mentality where I would drive an hour to pay for a few overpriced pills, and constantly check my phone to see if my dealer texted me.  

22: I turned 22 four months ago.  This is the year where I have really nailed into my head that I need to stop doing drugs for good.  I still take adderall a couple times a month, mainly to do last minute work or to party on weekends.  I smoke weed daily, which hasn't really affected me too negatively other than making me lazy.  The xanax though, idk when its gonna stop or if I ever can.... I wanna taper off, but I just got this new internship and things are going so well for me right now... on paper at least.  I don't want to enter this new internship feeling overwhelmingly depressed and anxious all the time, and I feel like I'd need xanax to function through some work days. I could probably take a day, maybe 2 days off of xanax and go to work, but I can't see myself just quitting completely without losing my shit for a while.  

If I were to just quit all drugs tomorrow, could anyone project what symptoms I would experience, and for how long? I know everyone is different, but maybe some similar experiences could help me better understand what to expect.

Any permanent brain damage to be expected?"
3pzk4v,4,2015-10-23,I do not feel like a person anymore,welcometoaninternet,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3pzk4v/i_do_not_feel_like_a_person_anymore/,"To preface this and make it as concise as possible, I'll do a synopsis of who I am and why I am here. 

I am the second child of four born in an army town, to a family of divorce. We never grew up rich, weren't necessarily poor despite the trying times during my childhood, but I was always taken care of. My parents separated when I was 15 and divorced when I was 17 when my dad left my family, twice, to go be with his mistress. My mom's house was foreclosed and she almost went bankrupt as a result of my father leaving us high and dry. The house was finally foreclosed in June 2012 and she moved three hours away while I stayed in the city she was moving from because I go to college here. Luckily, with my family of four moving away, I was able to live with a family friend who has helped me exponentially up until now. Thats my family life so now I guess I should give a background of myself. 

I played soccer from age 8-18, I played club soccer for 8 of these years, was MVP the first three years of high school, and played for a year in college before transferring. I always made decent grades in high school and graduated in the top 20% of my high school, even though I had attitude problems and acted out frequently which almost led to an expulsion my junior year. I had a core group of friends which I still keep in contact with or see a few of them frequently. I started college in August 2011 and I am just now in my first semester of my senior year. I have always worked to support myself throughout college and I get by financially, but I do not accelerate. I recently gained an internship for a congressman in my state, in addition to working a job on the weekends which I fare well with for only working two days, go to school for a total load of 18 hours, and I just acquired a second job. That is who I am and where I am physically at this juncture, which is why I am here. 

For lack of a better term: I 100% feel alienated to everyone and everything. I have a hard time describing it and I don't know how to accurately do so, but that's what I've been dealt. I can tell when I see the few friends I have now that they treat me as secondary, I usually have to initiate any form of one-on-one conversation and if I don't, it's usually because they need something from me or want something. I've become introverted towards mostly everything and I don't know where this comes from. I had a really bad anxiety attack that lasted about 2 days and almost ended everything for me in February, in which one of my friends who never initiates anything with me showed up at my house by consequences unknown. So this feeling isn't new, but it hasn't subsided. I feel so alone in a crowded room. I can't make myself clean my own house. I can't even comprehend how to initiate conversations with women as a result of being in an unhealthy longterm relationship that has left me emotionally deprived. I am having to deal with a sister that is borderline suicidal because it has become apparent in everything she does that she does not want to be here anymore. I have so many people (my family, few friends, mentor, professors, coworkers) vouching for me in one shape or form as I try and cobble myself together so I can graduate with a Poli Sci/History double major and attend law school. I have people vouch for me and I can't even legitimize myself or my actions anymore. 

This is the most open I have ever been about this and I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like a shell of a person, meaning people comment on my outward/private life, my apparent friends, and they don't seem to appreciate me just as a friend which is what I thought we were. I have been living by myself for two years now and despite having to be around people 8-10 hours a day, I still feel as lonely as I could be. I recently saw my own family for the first time in two months over my fall break and I could tell even that changed. My mother is struggling financially, my older brother started college again after being diagnosed with aspergers, my oldest baby sister is invariably anxious/depressed, and my baby sister is becoming unsure of how to make a life for herself. Aside from my brother who does his own thing and I am infinitely proud of him, my mom and sisters come to me for advice for their problems and I can't even solve my own, which furthers this inescapable loneliness. 

I've never posted on reddit before but I've always read it when I was on the internet. I'm not looking for help or answers necessarily, I just want people to know that if they feel fucked and lonely like I do, it's okay. You made it and you're still here. "
3pzth9,0,2015-10-24,Can we be together or no? Was that you're idea of letting me down easy?,jker210,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3pzth9/can_we_be_together_or_no_was_that_youre_idea_of/,"Soo uhh... Yeah... I just want to tell some people my ""situation"" if you'd call it that.

In all honesty it feels like it's nothing really.

Just a heads up, a lot of this is back story, feel free to skip ahead, I'll mark the part of which the main thing I'm concerned about is with bold.

I've always been awkward when it comes to girls I like. I've never been in a relationship either. There is this one girl I'd like to date though. I'm not sure what to do though. I'm 18, she's 17, I'm a freshman in college, she's a junior in highschool. I like her, and I think she likes me? Not too sure on that.

I met her my junior year in highschool, she was a freshman then. I didn't think about her too much. I thought she was cute, that's all. We were both the same race, which was something that my parents would have loved.

She'd always hug me, I'd hug back. I used to pet her, don't know why. It felt nice I guess. We weren't too close at the time, hell we aren't THAT close right now.

Summer of my junior year I had an internship at a university. She was attending a program at the same university. We'd walk together, and sometimes take the train home together too. I got to know her. On one particular day, I asked if she had a boyfriend. She did. I was like, ""Cool."" In all honesty I was cool with it. I hadn't developed too much feelings for her. 

Cut to next day, she seems down. I ask her what's wrong and she tells me that she got in trouble for sleeping over at her boyfriend's place without telling her parents. She insists that she didn't do anything, just slept. She had to break things off with her boyfriend though. She was prohibited from dating boys by her parents as punishment from what I can tell. Still, things between me and her carried on like normal.

**Jumping to December of my senior year,** I was walking her home. She was still single, still prohibited from dating boys. I guess I had developed feelings for her over the course of the year. I was going to ask her out.

""Hey, what would you do if I asked you out?"" Smooth one, idiot. I don't remember her exact response but she said something along the lines of if she could, she would.

I do remember her specifically saying something though.

""If I could go out with someone, I'd go to you instead of (old boyfriend's name).""

I hate to admit it but that made me feel really good. I feel bad for feeling good because her old boyfriend and I know each other and he's a cool guy. 

So we shared a rather longer hug than normal. I did my best to embrace her but I was kind of bummed that we couldn't go out. 

Over the course of my senior year, her old boyfriend is still her best friend. They're close. They're closer than her and I. We still hug, I still pet her, but they're closer relationship-wise.

And now I've graduated. I don't have enough time to see her. I'm thinking of seeing her tomorrow and asking if she's still interested in me. I don't know. I don't know how to date, how to read girls, how to do any of these things. I live a boring life. I play it safe. I never took a risk. The day I asked her out in December was the first time I ever asked a girl out. I want to ask her if she'd still date me. If not, that's fine. At least she'll be off my mind and happy. If so, that's fantastic. I'll do my best to be the best man she's ever been with.

I honestly just wanted to tell this to someone, who better than some random people on the internet. I don't know what to ask her tomorrow if I do see her. If anyone has any advice, I guess I'd appreciate it.

Holy wall of text Batman!

TL;DR: I like this girl, I think she likes me. I asked her out but she didn't really give me a straight answer. She's close to her ex (of whom she was forced to break up with) but I want to be with her.

Oh and if you read it all the way through, allow me to thank you for hearing me out. I'm young and stupid. This I know. Thanks for sticking to the post though. I'd give you gold if I could afford it."
3q15qc,3,2015-10-24,20M4A - This Cold War's about to get hot!,GRDerek,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3q15qc/20m4a_this_cold_wars_about_to_get_hot/,"I had started the day with the best of intentions. 

But I had been sidetracked. Oh so utterly sidetracked. 

The road to hell was paved with good intentions, as the world around me was showing. That particular stock phrase was a bit too melodramatic for my circumstances. I’ve always been quite down-to-earth, as I hope you will soon agree. In my case, the road to an-outcome-that-means-I-ended-up-wasting-the-time-afforded-to-me-in-what-could-be-my-last-day-of-life is paved with good intentions.

Hmm. “Hell” is more succinct. 

Allow me to introduce myself. 

I’m a pretty nerdy bureaucrat at the State Department. Quite young. Got a background in academia. I’m one of those guys who either skips meritocracy or embodies it, depending on who you ask. I’ve been accused of both. Strange how a concept we think of as so concrete is so open to interpretation, its objectivity so dependant on position. 

But I digress. I’m a policy wonk. I’m one of those pasty wiry geeks who writes a decent PhD thesis, gets a couple of good internships and make connections with some Senator or two, and then goes straight from some prestigious university department, laden with equally prestigious levels of student debt, to some overpaid-yet-still-insufficiently-paid job doing paper-pushing for some Under Secretary. 

The Under Secretary for Political Affairs, to be exact. 

Yes, it’s a delightfully vague remit, and I love it. 

If I haven’t already mentioned it, I’m a policy wonk. I like to think of myself as an enthusiastic contributor to debates on issues from food aid legislation to the GATT, from Middle Eastern power politics to anti-colonial protests in Africa. A jack of all trades, master of all related to fopo, if I may allow myself a brief boast. And I do not hide this enthusiasm. I carry esoteric sociopolitical journals, loosely organised bundles of wonkish policy proposals that I strive to thrust under the nose of any passing power player, and heavily annotated philosophical tomes with me to work, every day. I go above and beyond the call of duty when it comes to policy ideas, bold new initiatives, meticulously researched regulatory reforms. My ideas are either politically implausible or ideological anathema. I have effectively no power, no successes under my belt beyond slightly reducing printing costs in one corridor of the Department. 

But hey, it’s experience. 

And I enjoy it. It’s fun. So fucking fun. 

And as I arrived to work, one mid-October morn, I expected it to be the same as usual. I had some new policy proposals - that I hope I could see implemented using the famous “slip into somebody’s inbox” trick - about Caribbean development that I was very enthusiastic to present. I had even gotten them peer reviewed, in a sense, over a glass of beer or twelve. 

Alas, the day would live on in history, and not as the day that I cemented my position as a great ideological architect of a new era of compassionate capitalism, but as the day the Cuban Missile Crisis really got going. I was quickly told, in no uncertain terms, that I should either shut up about my policy proposals or manually use them to construct myself a structurally superfluous new behind, and the former option seemed preferable. My bosses - well, delegates of my bosses, people I had never seen before but had no choice but to trust because of their official badges and the fact that they could have snapped me into two if they wanted - had me running around. 

Relaying vital communications. Delivering crucial emergency contingency plans. Facilitating communication between the US and third parties. Ensuring a coherent cross-government strategy developed.

If I was writing memoirs, that’s how I’d describe my activities that day. In reality, I was enabling different branches of the government to deliver various synonyms for “we’re fucked if this kicks off” to one another. 

That was my responsibility for most of the day. 

Eventually, my duties for the day were made redundant. A more effective strategy for panicking was developed, I assume. But I was not allowed to go home and prepare for the potential apocalypse. No. One of the other managers insisted I do busywork, to maintain an illusion that the State Department was actually having a credible role in fixing this mess. I assume forcing underlings to carry out busywork was his own form of busywork. 

So, here I am. Sitting in a room. Alone. Ticking boxes, looking at an inconsequential phone that connects to some minor Red Army base in Siberia or some shit. I don’t know. 

Might as well pass the time.

Reposting this - am still looking for a partner!

Didn't get a reply when I posted this the first couple times during the theme day, and would love to revisit it. Long story short, there's two ways this can go. Either you can be a fellow State Department official, either a senior position needing stress relief or a fellow drone seeking to pass the time, or a Russian counterpart on the other end of the line, someone else completely shut off from any actual meaningful information. I'll be playing as the arrogant nerdy virgin bureaucrat whose voice you heard from above. 

Don't worry, he's not *too* much like me in real life.  

Turn-ons: dirty talk, public masturbation, ""fuck it we might be dead in a few hours"" sex, heated philosophical debates about the merits of our respective socioeconomic systems and various wonky policy ideas, being dominated (especially by a Russian), banging shoes on tables, power dynamics and/or technically being enemies, busywork, the Red Scare, detente, Soviet-America hotlines, destroying perfectly good idioms

Turn-offs: thawing in geopolitical relations, non-con and extreme stuff, proxy wars in Asia"

Not sure what to do.,throwww0,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3q1epv/my_22f_partner_29m_is_getting_really_frustrated/,"My partner and I have been in a rather short relationship -- 5 months. 

He's usually a  super great, genuinely nice guy. No bad intentions. We were also friends for a few years before so I trust my judgement on that. Hooowever, he works ALL the time, straight workaholic, very overworked, but it's because of the nature of what he does, and I (and a lot of the people around him -- his coworkers) feel bad about it. He does non-profit, really honest work, but because of the lack of resources around his kind of work, he does the job of like three people, and does not get paid for probably 80-85% of his hours. He scrapes by, under the poverty line, despite working or thinking about work basically all of his waking hours, 7 days a week. It's exhausting to even be around, so it took me some time to even be sure about wanting to be with him.

Most of the people around him, myself included, have been predicting that he wouldn't be able to handle this for long. However, I feel like I'm one of the only ones that genuinely wanted him to slow down -- his coworkers NEED him, so as much as they were/are concerned, they realize that if he slows down, the weight goes on them, and he's the only one in his organization with his specific skill set, so there's the worry that it would sink without him. Lots of pressure. He has friends outside of his workplace, but I feel like he doesn't communicate to them how crazy it all is, and besides, does not see them all often enough for them to fully understand, I think, what's going on. (There's a few of these friends, sees one a week probably, so probably sees the same person maximum once every 2-3 weeks).


So of course he finally had too much after a stressful event at work set him off. Now he's super frustrated but I think it's really depression, he's taken a day off, and is just not mentally there. Snappy with everyone, doesn't answer my texts or seem interested in me at all, distant, distracted, irritable, always sounds like he's going to start yelling or crying. It's really sad and I am trying to help him but he takes it out on me a lot (and I have been vocal about this a lot as well). What I mean by taking it out on me: snaps at me whenever I say I'm bothered by something he's doing lately (which could be ignoring me,  and yesterday, letting me get him off sexually and then not reciprocating which was pretty irritating, etc), snaps at me generally, makes mean, cutting statements towards me...

I've been vocal, as I said, I've told him I understand and that I want to help him, but that I really just want him to try to not be rude to me and to remember that I'm not against him. When I first said this, he said ""so you want me to deal with all of this, and also APPEASE YOU?"" and then he eventually said, with much effort, that he would try not to be a jerk. Still, whenever I point anything out, and I try to do it nicely, he just puts it on me super roughly and tells me I'm being so selfish and that he's done so much for me (when I in fact have been dancing around his crazy schedule for months..which seems unnoticed).


I know what's happening to him isn't fair and I am trying to help him. I've set him up with some ways to find volunteers and interns which seem promising. I try helping him relax when we're alone, tried to get him to therapy or at least out on a run with me (none of which are successful so far, but I'm trying.) But I don't know what to do or expect about the verbally shitty outbursts. They make me feel really bad, and yesterday they affected my own work, I was really snappy with everyone and made myself look like an asshole because I was so not present that everything that came out of my mouth was not thought out and thus not polite at all. (I understand this is what is happening to him.) I was generally depressed yesterday until I got home and was able to just relax and talk to my roommate ansd distract myself. Harsh comments really really get to me and affect my self-esteem. I have a history of abusive relationships and a history of depression and I do not want to fall into either of those and I worry this may happen if we don't find some kind of solid help for my partner soon. I just want a loving relationship and I wonder if that will ever happen in this scenario, which upsets me...because I'm not sure if it's him or his work situation that has him overworked. It's both, but I think it's partially part of his personality. I don't know what to do moving forward...


**tl;dr** My partner is overstressed at work and takes it out on me with harsh comments and generally a less loving demeanor than usual. What should I do to help him/handle this/help myself? i worry about what this will do to him, but also to my own mental well-being, and I wonder what this means to our relationship, and if I can ever expect it to be calm.

They couldn't get in contact with my parents. My brother - at 21, 5 years my junior - is dead. He shot himself. Calling my parents to deliver the news... the most agonizing moments of my life.

It's been just over a month without him. My brother meant the world to me. I cared so damn much. Helping him with homework, picking a school, applying for internships... I feel like I lived through him in a lot of ways. And I had so many hopes... he would graduate this spring. He'd get a job, move to the city, we'd hang out - as if we were kids again. He was to be my best man when I get married next year. We talked every day. He was my best friend.

I feel lost. I've gone back to my life. Back to work, back to bars with friends, playing all the same video games we used to every night like nothing's changed. Most days are okay. Nights are the worst. Sleeping pills have helped, but I'm still not getting to bed until 2am at least. But mostly it's okay.

Until I snap. Like now. I'm sitting in a park. I'm wearing his hoodie, his shoes, his headphones, listening to his pandora, looking at this damn funeral card I've carried every day since. And I can't hold it together. I feel broken. I feel like sobbing but it doesn't come.

My friends and family have offered so much support. Especially my fiancée... my parents and I would be a mess without her. But no one really gets it. Talking about it with them puts the pain on hold, but it never lasts. They want me to talk to a professional, but I don't see the point.

This wasn't how it was meant to be. I miss him."

3q2gx1,2,2015-10-24,Tips and tricks: Internship in SV,Amudsen,siliconvalley,https://www.reddit.com/r/siliconvalley/comments/3q2gx1/tips_and_tricks_internship_in_sv/,"Hello everyone,

I know that you get posts like this every now and then, but I have been quite unsuccessful with my applications so far and was wondering if I could find some helpful tips here.

To start off, I am studying Electrical Engineering at one of the top universities in the United Kingdom. I achieved first class (Equivalent to something around 4.0-3.8 GPA) in my first year. Right now I am only in second year (4 year course with integrated masters) but I already completed an internship in a software company (not in US) over the summer and I am eager for more. 

My aims are to hopefully land an internship in SV and possibly moving there full time. 

Now my problem is mostly networking. I have a few friends who landed nice internships in SV, some even in giants like Google and Apple, but I do not have any contacts to recruiters or similar. I am starting to feel that only sending my applications, without any other form of references is next to meaningless.

So there is my question. Any tips or tricks how to get my application to proper people? Would stalking recruiters on LinkedIn and sending an email directly be too much? Would they even read them?

Cheers

3q2mru,0,2015-10-24,Should I LTR this girl/is she a slut,JRTB_96,asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/3q2mru/should_i_ltr_this_girlis_she_a_slut/,"Met a girl around 6 months ago. I'm 19, very high SMV ( top 10 university, 1st team rugby, finance internships, built, cocky/funny/confident,own businesses etc ). She's 18, 8/10 looks wise but very feminine, pleasant, endearing, aims to please, and great to be around.

We've been dating for the past six months, we talk everyday, but are not exclusive. She knows I "" sleep with other girls all the time "", during these six months she has not slept with anyone else aside from me.

Anyway, when we first started dating she only had one sexual partner, a prior boyfriend, and was adamant that she wouldn't sleep around/ride the CC, espoused traditional values, seemed like an excellent LTR candidate. At the start of us talking, she had a ONS with someone at a house party which she massively regretted, and was extremely embarrassed about. Didn't think much of it, she was just a potential plate at the time. 

Recently we stopped dating, as a result of me dropping/dumping her, and within a few days she had another ONS , which she again apparently regrets, was drunk etc etc etc . We've started talking again now.

Whilst obviously being inexclusive , she can do whatever she wants, does this make her a slut ? Both times the ONS guys wanted to talk to her/ know her afterwards and she refused, and absolutely wouldn't be FWB with them. Also didn't sleep with anyone else during the time we were dating despite knowing I was. Also says she was "" angry and sad and upset and hated me "" at the time of the second one. Accepts that it was an extremely bad/dumb/slutty thing to do, says she did it out of spite for me dropping her.

 Gut tells me she isn't a slut, and would make a great LTR, but I can't get the image of her fucking a guy at a house party out of my head, but 4 guys at 18, including me, is rather a lot.

Any thoughts ?"

I plan to get at least a 1900 on the SAT. I calculated that the highest that I can get my gpa up to by the end of the year is a 3.0. My weighted gpa is a 3.2 and I'm taking all honors for my core classes and 1 AP class this year.

I really hate myself for being a lazy, procrastinating idiot in freshmen and sophomore year and I know its 100% my fault. At this point what I really want to know is am i stressing out to much and is there anything left for me to do to improve my chances?

3q4nq8,197,2015-10-25,"26 Female in an abusive household, just got a job, wants to move out but I have lots of loans and bad credit behind me. Can I do it and how?",yourfaceherenow,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3q4nq8/26_female_in_an_abusive_household_just_got_a_job/,"Hi everyone, 

First of all, this is a topic that I have been avoiding discussing for a very long time and I really want everyone's advice. I live in a family (some of whom are redditors so I'm going to be as vague as possible including details here) that I feel like control me. This includes to controlling how I'm spending and who I'm spending it on as well as who I'm spending my time with. Now, I don't go crazy or go to parties where I'm doing lots of drugs or sleeping with men. The last guy I kissed was about 6 months ago. I haven't had much of a love life since then. 

My mother passed away and I live in a household where my father is an alcoholic and where anything (and I mean literally anything) is critiqued and watched to finite detail. I can not live like this. 

I'm currently working in SF and commute about an hour and a half each way (that is when there are no delays) and it's taking a toll on my mental and physical health. I go home and if my father is not drunk and fighting with me or making comments, then its another one of my family members. And sometimes, I want to catch up on the work that I didn't get to that day and do it from home. The house is a mess and cleanliness is at an all time low. Even I stopped caring about my own room and spaces because I spend so much time taking care of everything else. 

I have traffic fines and bills and have poor credit and I intend on going to grad school but first need to take post-bac classes to get there (which is another cost). My entire life is a mess and I need to so get desperately out of here. I cry every night thinking I'm trapped because these people make me believe I can't afford living away from them. They want me to pay for a mortgage even though on the regular, my dad threatens to kick me out and tell me I'm a terrible person.  

I make 54k, I am paid bi-monthly. I have traffic fines totaling $500 dollars from when I was an intern, a credit card debt of $434.00 and a payment of 1200 from a student account from my time in college and another payment of 1200 for my first loan statement. I have to pay for maintenance for my car, totaling $3000 (transmission fluid, new tires, something about an engine?).

How do I get out??? "
3q4vd1,8,2015-10-25,Nmom asking me if I love her or if I'm just talking to her when she has use to me,[deleted],raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3q4vd1/nmom_asking_me_if_i_love_her_or_if_im_just/,"After some years with hardly any contact with my nmom because of a series of conflicts with her I am starting to see her again. All seemed fine but it did not take long for it to escalate again. 

A little backstory: i am a 28 year old male that was diagnosed with depression and social anxiety since the age of 17. Since then I have been through some difficulties to becoming an adult and building a  life for myself. It turned out this was basically impossible living from home.  Since I had no stable job or income and no degrees and quit school because I could not take the anxiety anymore I tried to escape from it by admitting myself to a psychiatric ward at 19. This gave me 3 months of relieve from all the stress and gave me people to talk to. 

As foolish as I was after these 3 months I was hoping that it would have calmed my mother down but the absolute opposite happened. It was basically hell from there on out and my anxiety was higher than ever. I did not go outside for a year and hid myself from the world and my parents by staying in my room playing video games. This was in a time where most of my high school friends were starting to grow up and having a normal adult life. I no longer had any contact with them because it felt like I no longer fit in. 

After some time I decided to find a therapist who could help me get back on my feet. We both started focusing on the abuse from my nmom and how to cope with it until I could become financially independent. I started school again and found a minimum wage job after my intern ship. I was 22 by this time and still living at home somehow. even though I had made progress, emotionally I was still anxious as ever.  After more and more conflicts with my mom it came to a stop when I could not take it anymore and pushed my mom away. She started crying and running downstairs. Within 10 minutes I had the police in my room and I had to be taken away. I spent the afternoon in a cell and was told I was banned from my parents house. If I moved within 10 meters of it they were allowed to arrest me again. 

This ment i was homeless except I was still lucky enough to have my full time minimum wage job. Since I did nothing in my free time I also had some savings left and started living from hotel to hotel room while looking for a place.  I also was seeing a probation officer because I was sentenced with a year of probation. Luckily she acknowledged my abusive mom and was supportive of me during this time and was a big reason I did not give up on my life.

 I eventually found a place that I could rent and was affordable for my salary. This is also where my dad came into the picture (he loves to stay in the background) note he silently also signed the form that banned me from my parents house because he has absolutely no idea how to handle any situation in our family and just follows my mothers directions. my father helped me move my stuff to my new place and I could say my situation was stable again. I stopped focusing on the past and started focusing on my job since it gave me a lot of distraction from what had happened. 

I eventually found a new job and my pay increased to the point where I was able to buy my own house. This gave me a very proud feeling and I felt like I was getting back up on my feet. My new house however is very close to my old parents house and my mom started making contact with me again. I felt like not much could break me again at this point and being able to solve the problems I had with my mother could maybe help me become more in life and move on. However she herself seems unable to cope with it and constantly came over as very frustrated and needy. It has now again come to the point where she is making awkward conversations and asking questions I do not have an answer to, including the one in the title. 

I started feeling vulnerable again and have been answering all of her questions with ""I can't answer this right now"". And every time I do she is asking more questions about how she is missing a son and needs warm and loving conversations with me. This makes me feel incredibly uncomfortable inside and also feel a lot of hatred for her not understanding how things work and making me waste the most important years of my life. 

I know I need to protect myself but i somehow can't go no contact with her. I feel like having contact with her makes me able to share all my achievements in live (see it as revenge) and show her that I can achieve things without her. Typing this again i feel childish for even thinking like this but i geuss my anger for her has been the fuel for my accomplishments in live throughout.  

I am no longer seeing a therapist so I can't really have someone give me advice in situations like this. I feel confused and not sure what the right reply would be to her. I am already feeling better just being able to type this out so I would like to thank you for reading this. "
3q4w5o,7,2015-10-25,Maybe writing about my feelings will help me a little,corgipatronus,MtF,https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/3q4w5o/maybe_writing_about_my_feelings_will_help_me_a/,"This past year has been the absolute toughest by miles. Hardly a day goes by where I don't end up crying for at least half an hour, I hardly leave the house when I don't have too, I only eat terrible food, and overall I just wish I could make all this darkness go away.

How did I arrive at my current predicament? Well, it all started at the end of last October when my then fiancee decided to postpone our engagement. She felt too young to be settling down and she thought it would make her less stressed as she was graduating from college that semester, so it was ok with me. We were long distance during her last semester of school since I graduated one semester earlier and got a job in CA. During the next few weeks she went from texting how we usually did in our relationship to barely texting at all. I did not bother her too much since I know she had a lot going on. Then on a Thursday I received a message that sent me falling into the pit that I am in today, ""I don't think we should be together anymore"". I was at work and immediately broke down sitting at my desk. I was able to compose myself for a few minutes to escape to my car and drive home. To me this was more than a breakup, before we ever started dating we were friends for 2 years. She was my best friend and actually my only friend. I have extreme social anxiety and was kind of a late bloomer so when I moved to FL in the 10th grade and left all the friends I grew up with in AL I became even more introverted and shy. Kimberly however was in my art class and as fate would have it she also had crippling social anxiety that she was dealing with. Though she had gotten over a lot of hers the year before. We talk in the one class we had together everyday and that was enough for her to become my best friend. I finally gained the courage to ask her out 2 years later. After that we were together for 5 years where the longest we didn't see each other during that time frame was 6 days. We went through a lot together and grew so much together. So when we broke up, I tried asking why but she didn't really have an answer. And for the longest time until recently I didn't know why either. Anyways after we broke up I was devastated, however we planned something way in advance (Hunchback of Notre Dame at the La Jolla) and she still came to visit for three days (she originally planned for a two week visit). Well maybe we just are not good at long distance, since we never dealt with that at all during our 5 years. She came and the first two days were awkwardly platonic as they could be. At the end of the second day we talked about it and it seemed like we both agreed that distance is not good for us. When she left on the third day she gave me a kiss and told me everything between us will be ok. Really! I was on cloud nine I regained the love I thought I lost and now I could plan on going to celebrate her graduation and Christmas with her in December. During the next few weeks I didn't bother her very much and let her wrap up all of her final projects she needed to complete her degree. I was handling booking a trip to Disney World to celebrate. I still had an uneasy feeling during this time because she did not seem so cheery about me coming but I brushed it under the rug as her stressed at school and held on to the shred of hope she gave me when I visited. I took off on my plane with gifts in stow and from the moment I arrived I knew that my hope was just hope after all. It was absolutely soul-crushing and to add more to the awkward situation I said I still wanted to go on the trip to Disney World. During these two weeks I was visiting and staying with her, she started gaining feelings for a new guy and started to date him during this time. Me being absolutely lost and scared and really confused tried to be the best person I could be at the time and despite being utterly hurt and devastated played it off like I was cool with being friends. We moved out of our FL apartment and she graduated then we went to Disney World. A place where we would escape our troubles earlier in our relationship, a place that brings smiles to the faces of so many, and I was there absolutely miserable pretending to still have a good time. During one of the days of the trip her new boyfriend was also in the parks, so after we went to Animal Kingdom that morning she left to go hangout with him and some other friends. As I sat there on the bench outside of the park I knew what loneliness was and hid my tears from all of the folks passing by. 

After the FL trip, I returned to CA with the ex since she had an internship at Disneyland for the next few months. Still trying to be friendly I agreed she could live with me so she didn't have to go broke pursuing her dreams and knowing how uncomfortable it would make her feel to have to live with a random stranger. She was also legally entitled to stay there because her name was on the lease but I paid all the rent before when she was still in school. It was an extremely awkward couple of months where I did cry every single day and did nothing else besides play video games and go to work. She ended up returning to FL after her internship was over. 

Now that I'm 90% sure I am transgender and I am out to myself, I can use this to explain why maybe our relationship ended. We did not fight much but looking back at the fights we had I can say a lot blame could be place on me being uncomfortable in a male gender role. I would really love to regain the friendship we had but being demisexual I am not sure my romantic feelings would return and I would just be torturing my self if they did. Since I am without a doubt for sure she would be the easiest person to talk to about being transgender I really would like to talk to her again(we occasionally still text a bit but it's nothing besides a bit of small talk). I know what she did to me was hurtful but I know it was not malicious in anyway. Everyone says I should be angry about what happened to be but I can't be. I was hurt and am still hurting mostly because it feels like I lost my closest friend. 

I now have a studio apartment that I share with my cat and dog. It's not much but it's still to much for me to take care of right now. I have no family around since they all live back in the east coast. And the closest thing I have to a friend that lives nearby is one guy at my work that I occasionally do something with.

Hopefully this narrative isn't too long or disorganized but that is kind of how this last year has been for me. I have also had the darkest thoughts of my life where I even decided a date a one point but being around for my ex-girlfriend's mom's suicide, I really don't want to hurt myself. Also, finally being able to put a label onto all the feelings I have had for my whole life has actually put a little bit of hope back into my life. I know I still need to seek help, make friends, and continue to explore my newly accepted self to climb out of despair but so far the war is just beginning and I've got a lot of climbing to do before I'm happy again. Hopefully I find the right weapons and allies to make this war as short as possible.

I'm a student applied informatics at Gent and in my last year (this one) we have to go on an internship (stage). I specialized in networking &amp; operating systems and I want to combine this with my hobby gaming.

So I'm looking for a company in Belgium (I prefer Flanders or anything close enough to it) which is specialized in Networking and servers for gaming. Like companies who provide the networks at events or lanparties. 

I think event networks &amp; game servers are a big part of the future with the upcoming eSports. So I want to be part of it and I think that an internship in this sector is the best way to learn A LOT!

If you know any company that you think that should be mentioned but is not in Belgium send me a pm ;)

Any ideas are welcome!

Erin: Someone very dominate for her since she seems to be unsure/innocent... and she needs somebody that can break her of that streak.

Kelly: I have a feeling that she'd use just about anyone to make Ryan jealous. Let's give her a new person to do just that with. We can figure out if he's a perfect fit for her or just a guy with a dick that can shut her up for a few minutes at a time while they do some dirty things with one another!

3q6imo,15,2015-10-25,Completely socially out–and my friends are truly awesome about it.,MaliceDespie,MtF,https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/3q6imo/completely_socially_outand_my_friends_are_truly/,"All of the friends I meet in real life on a day-to-day basis already knew. The few I'm talking to on twitter also knows. My mom knows. My sister knows. The last hurdle was the dreaded Facebook post. I've been drafting and drafting for about 2 weeks until I had composed a text I was satisfied with.

I wrote it in Swedish, but I translated it for you guys 'cause I thought you'd like to read. &lt;3

**""Oftentimes**, I wish I could start over.
That isn’t a particularly unique idea, I'm sure most of us felt that way at some point. Imagine how much better everything could’ve been, if we only had the chance to correct the mistakes we made, mistakes that continues to shape us even to this day...

But time goes, and we with it. Inexorably it trudges on, and we can’t pause or rewind. Sometimes we simply have say to ourselves:
Better late than never.

There is much in my life that hasn’t clicked. Puzzle pieces that don’t fit. It's no fun for me, one who inherited the eternal problem solving need of my father and the fiery, dictating the heart of my mother. My solution has always been a distraction. Hiding. Postponement. An expert I have become on finding excuses for everything between heaven and earth, and especially to avoid having to really think and actually look ahead.

This spring and summer I have taken the first steps in taking responsibility for myself and my own wellbeing. It’s been half a year of almost complete introspection. I have sought and started receiving professional help. It has felt like an eternal process of cleaning up inside but I've finally started to get things in order. I'm still the same person, but I now have a greater understanding of what I need to feel good, and be able to remain alive.

There are many things to handle, and one of the biggest I have now begun to seek medical help for. So far I’m a doctor’s visit and a referral into the process, the Swedish healthcare machine is slow as we all know. So while that’s being worked on I’m going to deal with everything else that is needed. Employment or internship is next in line, and on that front it looks hopeful. You may have noticed! However, I am a little anxious about being tied up with any long-term employment, given what it is I seek medical help for.

Yes yes, I know you are curious. Hold onto your hat because here it comes:

I myself would describe it as a congenital hormonal abnormality. Perhaps a chromosomal abnormality, but scientifically it is not actually determined that it’s about the chromosomes. There are women who have XY-chromosomes as well as there are men who have XX. Chromosome checkups are actually not done very often, since they are expensive and time consuming. See, you might’ve learned something new there!
Anyway. I am me, the individual in my brain is and will always be the same, but my body is of the wrong edition. Wrong model. Wrong gender. The name I have rings false, and if there’s something musicians have difficulties with, it’s untuned instruments.

It’s always a thought that’s been with me in some form or another, but it was easier to dismiss and ignore when my body was somewhat androgynous, in childhood, in adolescence and in my teenage years. People who had known me a long time know that I experimented a lot with my style and my appearance in high school with the help of makeup and clothes. It feels very strange to _not_ look back on my teenage years with an embarrassed sigh and shake my head like everyone else. Instead, it feels like it was at that time I truly was on the right track.

But life happened, and I ended up stopping taking my own feelings seriously and started looking for my identity elsewhere. That isn’t something I hold someone responsible for. Well, except myself, of course. If I could start over...!

Equality and justice has always been a given for me. That there are guys sometimes perceived to be feminine and girls sometimes perceived to be masculine is never something I thought about. It just is. Everyone has always been nothing but themselves in my eyes, and personally I think I have done well in renouncing my prejudices around gender.
The problem for me is that I’ve always thought very superficially about myself: ""clearly **I** can just be a feminine guy"". Of course I could be, and there would’ve been nothing wrong with that, but it was an excuse for me not to explore the idea as much as I would’ve needed. Had I done it, and sooner or later released my convulsive grip of the term ""guy"", I’d probably had come to this realization a long time ago. Better late than never.

Because all of a sudden, there’s so very much in my past that’s starting to fit together. It not only feels good, but everything I’ve ever felt about myself is becoming completely explainable.
I want to emphasize:
That I am Trans is 100% reasonable. Hopefully you think the same way.
Perhaps you, especially my family, can recall something I've said or done that could be more understandable with this in mind. Usually I kept myself to myself, of course, but there’s probably something you can remember.

I want to emphasize: I am still me. Yes, I will wear my new name, and sooner or later I’ll need a new Social Security number, but the only personality change I will go through is that I will be more comfortable with myself, and not as detached from my surroundings.
""Transsexualism"", as it’s still so vulgarly called in the darkest dungeons of the Swedish medical world, according to more recent findings, isn’t a mental disorder at all. It’s more of a response to a hormonal error during the fetal stage. As society is built today, this mismatch between the brain and the body usually takes on psychological aspects such as depression, dissociations and anxiety. How frustrating society may seem for those who feel they somehow don’t fit in, but that is nothing new to any of us.
But yes, we still have an image of ourselves, of Sweden, where we as a country are very responsive, nurturing, on the frontier of human rights, right? We have our world class universal healthcare! At the same time, we have only heard horror stories about psych- and transgender health care. Why is the name of the diagnose still ""transsexualism"" and why it is still considered a mental disorder among those who have been commissioned by the state to care for trans people in our country?

Remember that trans healthcare in Sweden did not stop with compulsory sterilization until 2013 and the trans people who had to undergo this have yet to be compensated or apologized to for this humanist breakdown.
We must remember that we still live in the middle of history. It was not so long ago that Sweden was doing reprehensible things such as eugenics, and under a banner called ""racial hygiene"" sterilized over 50,000 people due to reasons like being asocial, they were considered promiscuous, had foreign origin or possessed any other non-swedish traits. In this category transgendered people were placed and they were the last group to have to endure forced sterilization through this program between 1976-2013 (the program started in 1934).

We can all agree that the Swedish compulsory sterilizations were inhumane and entirely morally reprehensible, but there are still many traces left of its mentality in the Swedish institutions. And, unfortunately, even in civil society.


... Another one of my qualities is that I have very easy to obsessively study when it comes to things I feel a strong connection to. “Hjärnkontoret” [children’s science TV-show, like “Discovery channel”] was one of my favorite shows when I was little. Be inquisitive [The show’s tagline]!

Anyway. Where I wanted to go with this little snippet from the Swedish history of transgender people is that many things that many people think about trans people is completely incorrect, outdated or misleading. I want you to ask me questions about it. I want you, for my sake, to do as I’ve done and be inquisitive instead of going around believing something untrue about me unnecessarily.

For example: despite the diagnosis sadly still being called ""transsexualism"" in the Swedish medical world, it has nothing whatsoever to do with sexuality, but with gender identity. It has nothing to do with whom you are attracted to, but how you see yourself. That is why the group is nowadays referred to as trans people, because it is a more respectful description.

I don’t want you to not understand me, because I hate it myself when I don’t understand. It makes me feel a bit sulky. So ask me about anything concerning this, I’ll tell you what I know. Dare you not do it in the comments then please, send a private message or a text. Explaining in text is easier for me, so it has always been.

Finally, many of you had deserved to hear this from me personally. But now this is how it happened, and I do not regret it. I have also, in purely preventive measure, unfortunately had to remove a lot of people from Facebook which I suspect might not be taking this so well. If you’re reading this and don’t ""agree with me"" in this, or ""think I'm doing wrong,"" I ask you flat out to remove me from your friends list. This is nothing that is debatable. If you do not like it, respect me then at least by just removing me.

What is happening right now in the process is this: I stand in a queue to be contacted by the Stockholm trans health care team. They’re under high pressure right now, the new trans care guidelines released this year has made this type of care more available to people who need it. But this for me has been long overdue, so what harm is there in a little while longer?

Time trots ruthlessly on. We can’t pause or rewind, and when we have to wait, we can’t fast forward.
Time goes on and we along with it.
And you have plenty of time to get used to the name **Alice.""**

The response so far has been nothing but love and support, and it truly warms my heart. I've kept an eye on my friends-counter and it hasn't dropped. It's absolute bliss to know that you've picked your friends so well. The turnout in the comment section, in the PM's and everywhere has been staggeringly high and positive. I couldn't have made it without them.

The only thing that worries me is that I've yet to hear back from my dad and his new wife. They lead a very conservative life, and while I have no doubt that my father is on my side, my stepmom never ever was and she was kind of the boss of that family. She's the one holding the huge chunk of conservative beliefs and my father is just kind of along on the ride. I don't have much contact with them but it's still nice to know that there's no barrier between us and I don't want one to be raised because of this.

Anyway, I'm writing this to you because trans*reddit has been an invaluable resource for me in my self-exploration. That means you. You're helping me finding true happiness, the one coming from within, and I couldn't have done it without you. I love you. &lt;3

**Update:**   
Dad just wrote. He described my post as ""interesting and dazing"" and wants to see me tomorrow to talk about it. I'm alright with this, but I asked him to just tell me in short how it made him feel. He said ""I've got no problems with what you are or what you want to be. You are my child and my only wish is for you to be happy"".   
Tremendous relief. God I'm so thankful for all of this!"
3q6saa,4,2015-10-25,"Me [24F] with my former coworker [late 20's???F], I'm back in town looking for work and I think she's interfering with my application",throwawayboxoffice,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3q6saa/me_24f_with_my_former_coworker_late_20sf_im_back/,"So, I'm slightly ashamed to say I made a throwaway account, but I know she reddits and I'd rather not risk anything.

But first, a bit of background:

I interned with this one company for a year. I worked really well with everyone in the box office. To explain my position better, I was a ""manager"", but my realm of management did not include the box office. I worked with them very closely, but never have I ever been in charge of them. Nor did I pretend to. I thought all was good when... I few of my friends in the box office told me the new assistant box office manager, let's call her Sam, had taken to talking shit behind my back. I will be the first to admit I wasn't perfect at my job, but few people hardly ever gave me notes for improvement. I was open to them, but to no avail. I tried to be extra kind and treat her like everyone else in the box office, as a friend and human being (which is something that a lot of our customers forget). Apparently my attempts at this did not sway her in the slightest and she continued to hate on me, and some of my friends in the box office. (Again, not to our faces, but to anyone else who would listen- mainly the box office manager, who is Sam's direct supervisor.)

Now:

I have returned to the city that I interned in, I moved in with my boyfriend, and initially, my original work plans fell through. I was applying everywhere, even to this box office. My friends there had told me how they were struggling to get people to cover the day shifts. I'm already familiar with their ticketing program, so I figured why not, and submitted an application. My boyfriend, who works for the same company in a different department, went to ask the box office manager about a few days later. She told him the position had been filled. 

I was initially skeptical to believe that for a few reasons:

* I knew of 2 people that had left, and had been told of only 1 new hire. Thing is, it was Sam's job to train this new hire while the manager was out of town and it was a slower time for them because a rental company had the stage. The new person drove 40min. to get there to start training, and Sam sent her home because she didn't feel like doing it that day. Both the manager and Sam have also not announced this new hire to the rest of the staff like they usually do.

* One of my friends told me that when Sam found my application the next morning, she picked it up and laughed. She said something along the lines of ""Hahaha, I will make sure throwawayboxoffice never works here again."" The more I talk to my friends, the more aware they are of how tight scheduling is going to be in a few weeks without more help, and they all believe I wasn't given a fair chance.

* I do have a positive working history with the box office manager. There was one show where she ran a lot of things similar to what I was already doing, and I came specifically to help make it easier for her. If there was something she didn't want to do one day, she would turn it over to me, and I had no problems handling it. We even talked before my internship ended about hiring me to work for her when I came back. She claims otherwise. (I will give her the benefit of the doubt here, because it has been a few months, but one of my friends was there to corroborate that.) I think Sam's less than kind words may have affected how the manager remembers me. 

* I should probably point out where Sam is just not good at her job. One of the main responsibilities is interacting with the public. She is very quick to be snarky to the customers, both in person and over the phone. When the phones are supposed to be on during the day, she'll keep hers off and watch TV on her tablet and let whoever else is working with her answer the phone all by themselves. She is very rude and condescending to her subordinates, or others she deems ""beneath her"" in the box office. Aka, interns and almost all of the box office staff. From what I understand, she is making life quite miserable for everyone in the box office.

You may be asking why do I want to insert myself in this situation? It's for more opportunity and maintaining connections.

My main question is, who do I talk to about getting a fair shot at the job? I also feel like what Sam is doing with my application, negative recruiting me, isn't totally legal. I don't know if this is the case or if I could even argue it as a lot of it is hearsay. Is there anything I can do to combat this?
   
**tl;dr**: I used to work with Sam, the assistant box office manager who for whatever reason didn't care for me as an intern. Now that I'm looking for work, I think she's negative recruiting me to the box office manager. Who should I talk to about getting a fair shot at the job? Is there anything I can do?"
3q744k,2,2015-10-25,"Me [24F] with my [25M] ~1yr, found out some negative info about him that he doesn't know. Do I tell?",shadow_gallery,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3q744k/me_24f_with_my_25m_1yr_found_out_some_negative/,"My SO had an internship in town over the summer. Initially, his goal was to stay in town to be near me, but as he continued his internship he realized that he did not want to stay at the organization because it was a mess and he didn't think it was a good fit. My friend Tiffany also worked at this organization and she and my SO often worked together.

This resulted in a huge loss of motivation for him. He wasn't getting paid well to begin with, and he was still applying for salaried positions. The problem was that he was hardly ever at work on time. He would stay up late, wake up late knowing he wasn't going to make it on time, and made a habit of this. One time in particular, he overslept and missed an important meeting with his boss. Because my SO was moved to a corner office where ""nobody ever went,"" he figured he could get away with this behavior. These are all situations of which I was aware.

The other night, I went out with some friends and Tiffany. My SO is no longer with the organization in which he had his internship and has a salaried position elsewhere. Tiffany is still at this organization, and while we were out she decided to share with me some news. She told me that this organization was very close to letting my SO go before the summer was even over because they were displeased with his consistently late behavior and for other various reasons. She told me that the reason he was able to stay at the organization for the rest of the summer was because she stuck up for him. This happened on more than one occasion, and my SO knows nothing about this. I'm always honest with my SO and I never keep anything from him. It is really hard for me to have heard this information and not to tell him about it. It makes me feel like I'm hiding something from him.

Because he has since moved on from this internship, I don't even know if it's worth telling him what I found out. At his new job, he is way more responsible and is always there on time - no problems whatsoever. I know that Tiffany wouldn't be upset if I told my SO about it, and my SO would never confront her about the information either. What should I do? I feel strange keeping this from him. Any advice is appreciated!

TL;DR: Friend told me about how my SO's unfavorable habits almost got him fired from his internship over the summer. My SO doesn't know he was nearly fired, and I feel obligated to tell him this despite the fact that he has moved onto another job. What do I do?"
3q7n9e,14,2015-10-25,Learning to give her space,49raptorjesus49,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/3q7n9e/learning_to_give_her_space/,"So I started dating this girl who lives in my area, but goes to school about 9 hours away. The plan when we started dating eachother this summer was to keep it fun and low key, but by the end of the summer neither of us wanted to split.

I've done the long distance thing before and it sucked, but things with her were way better. She's been interning at an elementary school (she's studying education) 5 days a week from 6am-3pm while also having a full schedule of her own classes. Meanwhile I've graduated college and have a boring work life.

So things were always good, until this week. Starting tomorrow, she is going to take over being a full time teacher for two weeks, so all week she has been stressing about it and preparing. We've been barely talking, and when we do, she seems way less affectionate. I started worrying she was falling out of love, but she kept insisting it was because of how over worked she is.

I've tried to be a really good bf and never add to her stress, but this past week I've found myself panicking and being more needy because we weren't talking like usual.

She calls me this morning, and I once more asked what was going on between us, she insists just busy, but it doesn't explain why she was going to bed without saying goodnight, waking up and not sending me a good morning text, etc... Little things, but things that when you're long distance and communication is key, felt like signs that she was splitting from me.

We got in kind of an argument, she kept saying she couldn't do this, but I said she should be careful not to do something that she will regret once these two weeks over and can think straight again, and she said maybe we should just go on a break then. We kinda kept talking a bit trying to figure it out, when she sort of freaked out and said she had to go (prepare for school tomorrow) and hung up. 

Haven't talked since. Obviously she needs some space right now. I sent her a text a couple hours after the call saying that I'd give her as much space as she needs and kind of leaving it open while also wishing her luck tomorrow, but no response 

The tough predicament I'm in now is that I don't know what our status is, whether we're together, on break, or actually broken up. And I can't really ask her about it because she is so busy and I know she will just be more upset with me if I can't leave her alone.

I'm not good at this. I want to text her so bad. I miss her, I want to fix things, but maybe the only way to fix things is to wait until these two weeks are over. I can't distract myself with anything because I keep thinking about her and feeling bad.

How am I supposed to give her space? I don't even know what the status of our relationship is anymore, I have awful anxiety about it, but I'm expected to sort of sit back and do nothing?

**TL;DR**
Girlfriend is starting a two week full time teaching internship, she's super stressed and has been acting different towards me. I need to give her space while she does these two weeks, but I also am trying to make sure our relationship doesn't fall apart "

I stretched myself thin this semester (hoping that in doing so, I'd grow to fill in the cracks) between an internship, leading a EWB local project, classes, and my screwy brain getting in the way of all of it.

Cersei Lannister: I'd love to play a guard that she takes a liking to and is actually able to 'make' her do things that she wouldn't normally. She likes his assertiveness and the fact that he is unafraid to tell the queen to bend over like a common whore, or get on her knees and swallow no matter how little she cares to do so.

Daenerys: For her, I'd love to play someone that can take her away from her 'Queenly' state and make her feel like a dirty young girl again. Whether that's one of her closest bodyguards, a trusted adviser, or a soldier for her army..... or maybe she gives her body up as a prize to a much needed ally perhaps?

Shae: After all that she did? I just want to treat her like a whore at the whorehouse.... Is that so much to ask?

Others: Arya Stark, Catelyn Stark, Margaery Tyrell

---House of Lies---

Jeannie: Obvious one here, but I'd play almost anyone against her in some fashion. A new boyfriend that is truly her baby daddy... A past fling coming back in to her life and wooing her .... A booty call on a business trip that turns in to something slightly more serious.... Etc etc!

Monica: She needs a nice young stud to keep her busy, doesn't she? I'm thinking an intern that she tries to belittle and finally wants to ease a bit of tension and then realizes just how big of a boy he is ... and it draws her to him more and more even if they really don't get along on a personal level.

Others: April, Sarah Guggenheim, Marisa McClintock, Brynn

---The Office---

Pam Beesley: Something without Jim would be fantastic. Whether she's desperate at her apartment after breaking up with Roy that she'll give herself up to the landlord for more time/lesser rent... Maybe she's lonely and lets a warehouse guy take her for a ride that she can't help but want to relive on a nearly daily basis? Or an intern that she catches taking a liking to her and who knows where they go from there!

Jan: Another cougar that needs a young man. She's shown many times over that she loves interns and younger men in general!

Erin: Someone very dominate for her since she seems to be unsure/innocent... and she needs somebody that can break her of that streak.

Kelly: I have a feeling that she'd use just about anyone to make Ryan jealous. Let's give her a new person to do just that with. We can figure out if he's a perfect fit for her or just a guy with a dick that can shut her up for a few minutes at a time while they do some dirty things with one another!

Others: Angela, Meredith, Holly Flax....

Feel free to toss almost anyone else at me too as I'm sure I've missed some! Looking for something potentially long-term but I'm more then happy with just doing one scene if you'd rather go that route!

There are some mods already doing this, but by now, those are the only reason I still have to use a modded server. So i thought of a few different ways on how to do so with commands and repeating command blocks. But the easiest way would be a new block like this:  
  
* can only be obtained like command_block with /give @p protection_block
* can only be removed/edited in creative mode
* once you right-click on it a window opens to set up the block

It should contain the following:

* fields with x1 y1 z1 and x2 y2 z2 for defining the area
* toggle buttons to switch On/Off different protections like
    * block building
    * block removing
    * interaction (open doors, push buttons etc.)
    * maybe also:
    * spawn monsters
    * spawn animals
    * fire protection
    * pvp
    * team pvp
* a textfield where you can define who is affected of it like @p[team=!red] or @a
* and a toggle button for always active/needs redstone

it should also have an intern uprising id, so that the last placed block has priority and you can make areas within other areas

this way, we would be abled to build survival servers with massive gameplay extensions, but don't have to be worried that the main mechanics and especially the nice buildings get destroyed"
3q9mxw,219,2015-10-26,"My [28M] fiance's [27F] parents are struggling to pay $10,000 for cultural wedding ceremony back home in a couple of weeks",InLawDramarama,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3q9mxw/my_28m_fiances_27f_parents_are_struggling_to_pay/,"**Update 1:** Sigh!! They’re burying their heads deeper in the sand… So I met with my fiancé last night and spoke lots of things through. It was difficult being on the receiving end of her frustrations but that’s what you do in love, right? I tried separating the issues (giving money to parents and in laws) and she largely understood. Difficult to fully gauge her understanding but we can cross that discussion again once we’re out of these woods. ‘Thankfully’ a lot of the money for our modern wedding has already gone to the caterers and providers and even though I suggested revisiting the contracts etc, she didn’t want to entertain the idea. Much of her disappointment is probably in her feelings of not being able to help them etc… Anyway, after much discussion, I really hit the nail on the head when she revealed they paid a deposit for a caterer instead of paying for their food for the month and water. That floored me, but I kept calm and said she shouldn’t feel responsible for the financial decisions of others. I put it to her in such a clear logical way, if she doesn’t get that, then we’ll never last…but it’s difficult for me to get whether or not she understands as she’s still in a stressed place right now… Anyway, I spent the rest of the evening just being there with her. 

Today, just now, the future MIL called me which was a bit surprising but shows the level of desperation I guess. She was ok on the phone and asked me to hug and be there for her daughter that everything will be ok. Annoyingly, she is still committed to the event and I tried, as respectifully as I could to explore her cancelling it but they’re locked in. I tried as respectfully as I could to say no one is holding a gun to her head and she could cancel/postpone but she said it’s too late now, people are already on their way. She said they could (and should) have cancelled a few weeks ago (cue the loudest ‘I told you so’ in my brain ever) but it’s too late. I kind of feel like with her calling me directly and the closeness to the event, it’s going to happen now. The MIL kept asking me to just be there for them, however, good/bad the event turned out to be. I think we’re too far in now and there’s no other action I can do as a young person in this family setting. I can only react to events as they unfold now.


**Throwaway as her sisters are active on Reddit and know my account. Some dates fudged**

Hi all, I’m getting at my wits-end and could really do with some tough advice. Some context; I [28M] have been with my fiancé[27F] for 2 years, we got engaged Nov 14, wedding date is Jan 3rd 2016 here in US. Whatever you read of this, I love my fiancé very much and very much want to get married to her. We have small issues but we communicate well and work through them. The wedding plans here are going ok and we both have well paid jobs that are just about helping us meet the costs etc… However, my future parents in law are throwing an extravagant wedding for us back in our home country that is creeping close to the $10,000 mark (extravagant by my standards and taking into account conversation rates and power of the $, expensive). Important note: Both our parents predominantly live ‘back home’ and moved back to set up business. My parents moved back to the rough area on the border of the major city where you have to run your own generator and the roads are a bit funny, but it’s got decent running water. Her Parents moved back to a new development estate near the middle of the city with running electricity etc… 

So, anyway, we fly out for the wedding 3rd Nov, for the native ceremony on Nov 13th. These days, cultural views are getting liberal around this native part of the wedding and people like us who live in the west don’t always have to fly out to them. And/or, they don’t have to be a big affair. Ever since my partner and I got engaged and discussion about the home-country ceremony was had, my father and I were on the liberal side that erred against doing anything extravagant back home. People can do the traditional part but sometimes, it’s scaled back, and/or you can put a blow up size picture of the couple at the front to avoid them forking out $700 tickets each to fly over… Anyway,  the strength of emotion on my fiancés side was high so we agreed to fly out to attend and let the family do whatever they wanted to do for it. That discussion was in December 2014. Fast forward to now and the ceremony has put the future parents-in-law in a very very tight spot. Their business is in private schooling and currently, it’s struggling. They are struggling for money to pay staff, to eat, for their rent, for lots of things. The fiancé was on the phone with the parents last night and the dad is having a mental breakdown, crying, scratching his head about meeting the cost for everything. Which they haven’t even come close to doing. 

I offered, a couple of months ago when I first caught wind of this, to make a fuss all on my own and ask for the ceremony to be cancelled… without giving much excuse or reason to the external family and friends. I was (and still am) willing to take the proverbial rap for screwing up the native ceremony and cancelling it or asking for it to be scaled back. My fiancé liked the idea, but the future in laws felt it was a shame to rely on me to help them out so the idea was shelved. And ever since actually, it’s gotten awkward with me and the future MIL. We used to whatsapp regularly, now I feel like I’ve insulted her and she feels shame etc We’re in a worse situation now where a couple more people from the West have bought expensive last minute tickets and are flying out… the in-laws are probably feeling they’re in much more of a tight-corner and the mental anguish is building up on them. I just got off the phone to fiancé who says, nothing has been paid for, the ceremony area is a mess and they still need $10,000 to deliver on the ceremony.

I don’t know what can happen, the mom is also losing it. 

Unfortunately, this pride thing has kind of come up before… Quick detour example; My parents are far from rich but have worked hard from nothing back home to have a couple of properties here in US. My fiancé and I have reached an agreement with them to take over one of the properties, let’s call it StraightHouse, which is a 3 bedroom property. I currently live in our 4 bedroom family home with my siblings [30M &amp; 24F], let’s call that LakeHouse. My parents stay in one of the rooms whenever they are in the country, whcich is once or twice a year for 1-2 months. My fiancé rents out a 2 bedroom place, let’s call that ParkHouse. She sleeps in the living room, one of her sisters [23F] sleeps in one room and her brother [18M] used to sleep in the other but he has now just moved to uni. This sister is about to undertake a 2-3 months internship back home where she wouldn’t mind living long term anyway… So, I spoke with my parents a few months ago and suggested my fiancé cancels the lease on the place she’s renting and if the sister returns back from the internship, she lives in LakeHosue, my family’s home. She gets on with my sister and there aren’t any underlying issues with anyone. My fiancés brother and her parents and anyone else can stay with us at StraightHouse during holidays/whenever they’re in the country. The future in laws declined it. Maybe they didn’t really understand the pitch..?

I spoke with my dad afterwards because that situation really annoys me as it feels sooo inefficient to continue renting ParkHouse… particularly as its 90% likely my fiancé (and I) will have to carry on the payments for the place. The 18M brother is in uni and the [23F] sister is unlikely to get a job that can afford the rent anytime soon. We definitely have to subsidize that place now as the parents are increasingly scrabbling for cash.

I’ve been quietly against it for a while now but I’m seeing all manner of problems rise to the fore. My fiancé says her father has always sacrificed for the family and his one pride would be to run this native ceremony. I have to be delicate during this time as they definitely do need money to eat/live but I’ve barely begun our lives and I’m not feeling too keen on making major sacrifices like this for a period. Particularly as I have things and business plans (MBA degree I was halfway through, my startup) I’ve but on hold, or stayed in the well-paying but boring job to save up for the wedding.

Because of culture and stuff there’s limited things I can say to the future in laws. I asked fiancé about telling other aunties etc but she says her mom will never speak to her again. Unsure what to do!!


**TLDR: Future-in-laws are struggling to pay for traditional wedding ceremony back home coming up 13th Nov. Unsure how to talk to fiancé about this and what my role should be. We have little money we can send towards them particularly as we are saving up for modern ceremony taking place in US, 3rd Jan 2016. How do I work through this?!?**

edit 1:

She’s just spoken to an elder church mentor person she trusts who has suggested many options to her, one of which she has cottoned onto… raise money from her friends and look for other loan options. Grrrr!! I just suggested u/not-bad-advice option of us cancelling it but she doesn’t seem too keen. I said we can help them avoid throwing good money at bad but she’s now suggesting the parents have already committed to a lot of things, it’s just paying it off in full?! I said she told me they had $10,000 left to pay off, she says that may not be the full figure as they have already paid some bits off. My heart is sinking. I’ve helped them out with money once or twice before and my fiancé can’t get over her compulsion to help her parents . FML… "
3q9nh2,4,2015-10-26,Unemployment help needed - Dealing with parents,fauxfell,Unemployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unemployed/comments/3q9nh2/unemployment_help_needed_dealing_with_parents/,"I am 22, recently graduated in graphic design, unemployed and feeling depressed about it. My parents in particular are making me feel unhappy, worthless, wrong in everything I do, useless and like I am not trying. 

&amp;nbsp;

I have been unemployed for 4 months. In that time to seek employment I have:

-  Applied to 10-20 jobs a week

-  Gone to hand in my cv personally to some of these places

-  Applied for internships

-  Gone to 5 interviews

-  Worked on improving my contacts and social networks

-  Done freelance work. 

-  Consistently improved my portfolio and CV, checking it with over 15 people. 

-  Tried to improve my skills in calligraphy, drawing and various software to improve my skills. 

Despite all of this, I am left unemployed with feedback of “not enough experience”. I have 4-5 months of employment in my field so as a new grad, it shouldn’t be a huge deal.   



My problem lies with my parents. I am mostly living at home at the moment and every day they insist on interviewing me on what I’ve done that day, how I could do things better, why I didn’t get a response from a company. They constantly imply that I am not trying, that my CV, portfolio and cover letters are written poorly though they are the only ones who say so. Any time we are with the company of anyone else they always must have a discussion of if they know any graphic designers, and how I’m unemployed and need practise. While I know they are trying to help, it is incredibly embarrassing and uncomfortable for me, especially when I know full well that the person will not. They also imply that I have done nothing over the summer. My father commented that he’s meant to talk harshly to me because he’s like an interviewer. I don’t want an interviewer for a father- I want a Dad.  
  
&amp;nbsp;

I truly feel like I can’t talk to them or relate to them at all. They are critical and rude about my hobbies of gaming, reading, running and my political views.  They criticise my appearance and my clothes (which is very normal clothing for someone of my age.) Though they don’t say it, I feel like I am constantly being compared to my sister and brother – both of which are older, more academic, and well established in their lives. All of this has destroyed my self-confidence. I was diagnosed with reactive depression 12 months ago from the first relative in my family dying. I finally felt myself again in June and now I can feel myself slipping back.   
  
&amp;nbsp;

On the other side, sometimes I get to spend time with my boyfriend’s family. When I’m there, I feel really accomplished, motivated, happy and good about myself. I can talk to his parents about anything. In his family, I get positive feedback for practising my skills. I get constructive criticism on my work. I get sympathy for interviews that I didn’t get, not “You did this wrong, why didn’t you say that” when I’m already feeling sad. I feel at home, and I feel loved.
  
&amp;nbsp;

I’ve been distant at my parent’s house recently because I always expect an attack of the discussion when I am around them. They can’t last long without bringing my unemployment up. I haven’t been sleeping well for weeks and cry almost every day because I feel demoralised and hurt in their home. I recently came to the conclusion that they are hurting my mental health, and staying away would be a healthier option, though I know that would hurt them. 

&amp;nbsp;

When I’ve tried to talk to them about how they make me unhappy, they just shout at me that they are trying to help, and don’t realise that they are hurting me. When I have told them they that are damaging my mental health, they guilt trip me that it’s not fair of me to be unwell when my mother is stressed and when my brother has already suffered with depression. They tell me to grow up and sop being childish.  

&amp;nbsp;  

Sorry for the outburst. I don’t know what to do with my life and need some people to talk to...

3qa33d,15,2015-10-26,[MF oral] Shawna: Roma Revenge - Part VIII - Going downtown,WriterJim,sexystories,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexystories/comments/3qa33d/mf_oral_shawna_roma_revenge_part_viii_going/,"I slept like a baby that night, awaking refreshed despite Katlyn’s ominous words. I was surprised to see myself in the mirror, grinning like an idiot. Apparently, I’d been carrying a lot of stress around since my change, because I’d never seen Shawna looking so happy. I’d never felt so good, either. It still felt like I’d just had a weight lifted from me, and my back wasn’t even sore from Kat’s treatment. I went into the office, light on me feet and greeting people as I walked by them.  
Pam came by my office soon after I’d settled in. “Wow, Mary wasn’t lying,” she said, leaning against my doorframe. “You’re practically glowing this morning!”  
I chuckled. “I guess I woke up on the right side of the bed.”  
“And whose bed might that be?”  
“Pam, you’re HR, shouldn’t you be telling me not to make that exact type of comment?”  
She rolled her eyes. “Sure, whatever. Have you thought about my offer? You really brighten this place up, your work seems as solid as your brother’s, and let’s face it, we need more women around here!”  
I tried not to think about the problems with that statement. Still, it would be a bad idea to burn my bridges. “Tell you what,” I told her, “I’m supposed to be gone after this week. Come Monday, if I’m still around, I’ll take the job.” Besides, I didn’t add, if I was still around Monday, then “Shawn” would need a new, more long-term reason to be absent.  
“Deal,” Pam said eagerly. “I’ll put the paperwork together. You won’t regret it.”  
  
My phone rang around lunchtime. I picked it up and answered cheerily, “You’ve got Shawna. Talk to me.”  
Chris’s voice chuckled through the phone, making my heart turn over. “Someone’s in a good mood,” he said.  
“Well, I had a good night,” I replied. “I feel pretty great today.”  
“Is that so? Well, I think I’m about to make you feel even better.”  
“Ooh, I can hardly wait,” I purred. “Whatcha got for me?”  
“Ignoring that truly amazing set-up for a joke about my body,” he said, making me blush, “I got a call from Adam. He thinks he found your gypsies.”  
“Oh my God!” I spun around in my office chair, resisting the urge to jump up. “That’s fucking awesome!”  
“Aww, you didn’t say it.”  
“Say what?”  
“You were supposed to say ‘I could just kiss you’, I had this whole bit planned out.”  
I felt myself smirk. “Chris, if this pans out, I’ll do more than just kiss you.”  
“I may hold you to that,” he said. “Can I pick you up after work?”  
  
The afternoon flew by for me, floating as I was in excitement. If this lead was real, Chris had spared me a ton of effort and worry. I could go out there, get my body back, and my troubles would be over! And I got to spend time with Chris, which was always pretty great, too.  
I’d left my door open, but there was a knock anyway near the end of my day. I looked up from my computer, and there he was. Chris, wearing dark jeans and a shirt that hugged his chest in a way that gave me instant fantasies about him raiding my coastal village and carrying me off to his viking longboat. I shoved the thought away and stood, smiling.  
“Hey there, Shawna,” he said as I walked toward him. “I hope you don’t mind, I thought I’d come up and meet you-”  
His words were cut off by my lips pressing onto his. I hadn’t even realized I was going to do it; my body was acting on its own, lacing my hands behind his neck and pressing tight against him. His arm slid around my waist, making me feel like a tiny, fragile, beloved pet in his arms.  
Pam’s voice broke us out of the haze. “Oh, this explains a lot!” she said, grinning as we hurriedly disengaged from each other. “Oh no, don’t let me interrupt. You two just keep doin’ what you’re doin’.”  
“Pam,” I grumbled, annoyed at the sudden stark reality she’d pulled me into, “you’re the worst HR rep ever.”  
“Worst, or best?” she asked.  
Chris took my hand and squeezed it. “I think she’s pretty good,” he said. “It sounds like you maintain a ‘fun, productive work environment’.”  
I punched his chest with my free hand. “You’re supposed to be on my side!” I complained.  
“Hey, I’m on whichever side gets me greeted like that,” he replied, pretending my blow actually hurt. “Are you ready to go?”  
I glanced at the clock. “Almost. Can you wait in the lobby?”  
  
As soon as Chris was out of earshot, Pam and Mary invaded my office like hungry vultures.  
“Holy crap, Shawna,” Pam said, “No wonder you’re so happy today. I’d be glowing too if I was climbing that mountain!”  
I scowled at her. “Seriously, Pam, A: it’s none of your business, and B: he’s just a… well, more than a friend, I guess, but there has been no climbing of any sort, mountain or otherwise.”  
Mary scoffed. “You’re kidding.”  
“You too, Mary?”  
“Well, come on! A man like that, looking at you with those big blue eyes like you’re the only woman in the world? You gotta lock that shit down!”  
  
I chased Pam and Mary out of my office and sent some end-of-day emails, then headed for the lobby, dodging jealous and gossipy female coworkers and disappointed-looking male ones the whole way.  
One of the interns was chatting Chris up. I guess it was true what they said about women: they were ruthless and aggressive when it came to outdoing one another. I waved, catching Chris’s eye.  
His face, a mask of polite interest, lit up when he saw me. He dismissed the intern with nothing more than an “excuse me” and moved quickly toward me. “Shall we?” he asked.  
“The sooner the better,” I said quietly. “If you stick around much longer, one of these bitches is probably gonna shank me.”  
  
We got in Chris’s car and left. After some pointless small talk about the people we worked with during the day, I finally probed him about where we were going.  
“Well, it’s complicated,” he said. “Ben went into the city records and came up empty. But Adam checked old arrest and complaint reports, and found a bunch of unresolved cases concerning this Tokar woman, going back years. Weird shit, too.”  
“Weird how?”  
“Well, gypsy curses, mostly. Like out of a bad movie. Warts, boils, turned-my-girlfriend-into-a-frog. You know.”  
I looked out the window at the road. The car’s engine and wheels laid a white noise down that made my silence seem deafening. “Yeah,” I said at last. “Yeah, I know.”  
Chris glanced my way. “Shawna, why are you trying to find this woman? She sounds like bad news, at the very least.”  
I kept looking outside, watching cars go by in the other direction. “She has something of mine,” I said.  
Chris pulled into an alley and stopped the car. “Shawna,” he said, “I need to tell you-”  
Oh god. He was going to tell me he was in love or some shit. “Wait.” I shook my head. It had to be the weird pheromones. “You shouldn’t say it, you’ll regret it later.”  
He held up a hand. “That’s why I waited. I mean, with you… okay so when we first met, you were intriguing. I couldn’t get you out of my mind, and then when we spent more time together, I just felt… well, you know. Need.” He sighed. “I was raised a gentleman, and it’s been obvious that you were dealing with some heavy shit, even before the Tommy incident, so I behaved myself.But it’s not like that anymore.”  
“It’s not?”  
“No. I still find myself… incredibly attracted to you.” He reached over and put his hand on my cheek. “But not for the same reasons. Not with the mindless lust. You’re more than that, Shawna. You’re a wonderful, intelligent, witty, sarcastic badass, and I don’t think there’s one thing about you that I’m not nuts about. It’s like you caught my attention with a spell, but when it wore off I realized you didn’t need it to begin with.”  
I stared at him with a stupidly confused look on my face. I’d been a man for almost three decades, but not once had anyone said anything to me that was as kind and as flattering as what Chris had said on my fourth day as a woman. I didn’t know whether to smile from the compliments, or cry from the way I had to get them.  
Fortunately, Chris made the choice for me. Slowly, deliberately, he leaned toward me. I met him halfway, laying my hand over the one on my cheek and pressing my mouth against his. My eyes closed and I breathed in deep, filling my lungs with his scent, while our lips eagerly closed on one another.  
There was a double click as we both undid our seatbelts, and then I was in his arms. His hands pressed to me back and my hip, holding me close while we made out like teenagers, wrapped up in the need to touch one another.  
My own hands moved across his chest, enjoying the firm pad of his pecs before starting to pull at his shirt buttons. I wanted it off, needed it off, so I could feel more of him, but he stopped me, taking my hand in his and breaking the kiss.  
“I think I owe you something,” he said with a playful smile. “Lean back a little.”  
I did as he asked, leaning against the passenger-side door. He locked his eyes on mine and slid his hands slowly up my legs, hooking his thumbs over the hem of my skirt and revealing my thighs an inch at a time.  
He kept going, caressing my skin all the way up my hips until he’d fully exposed my panties. I’d worn a cute pair of light blue ones that matched my bra. No real reason, I just liked how they looked.  
He started to slide them down off me, finally breaking eye contact to watch as he exposed the little patch of hair. His breath caught in his throat when the fabric cleared my hips and I was laid bare for him.  
I could feel his fingertips sliding still against my skin. He lifted my legs, taking his time feeling every inch of them until he’d pulled the panties down to my feet, then removed them entirely. My ankles settled on his shoulders and he shot me a mischievous smile.  
“What are- whoop!” I laughed as he suddenly gripped my ass and lifted my hips into the air, but my laugh was cut off and replaced with a gasp when I suddenly felt his tongue against my sex.  
Actually, that’s not right. Chris didn’t just use his tongue. He used his whole mouth. Licking between my walls, lips tugging at my skin, sudden suction on my clit… he used so many tricks in such rapid succession that I lost track of anything but the waves of pleasure throbbing through me and the overwhelming sense of his desire, both to have me and to pleasure me. Powerful fingers dug into the flesh of my ass, keeping me from squirming even an inch while he attended to me. My fists clenched in his hair and my toes curled over his shoulders. There was a sound filling my ears that I didn’t recognize at first, until I realized it was my own voice, moaning in pleasure.  
My voice rose and my back arched while Chris played my pussy like an expert violinist. His hands slid up to my thighs, stroking my skin, and his lips and tongue kept up their tireless and unpredictable assault on my senses.  
“Fuck!” I cried out, “Fuck yes, I’m g-gonna…”  
Chris took that moment to look up again, just as he once more sucked on the bundle of sensitivity and need that was my clitoris. His eyes locked on mine and I gasped, tensing up every muscle in my body. I’d been on the edge of a cliff, and that look of passion, of… of love… had shoved me over like a herd of buffalo.  
He kept watching me as I came. Or at least I think he did, because my head eventually fell back when my body went limp, and still I could feel him sucking, and then licking, and tugging… he didn’t let up for a moment, blowing hot air through his nose onto my skin, and just as my mind started to return I came again, somehow harder than before.  
The breath I didn’t know I’d been holding came out in a scream of pleasure. My legs shook and I could feel myself constricting and spasming inside, suddenly very painfully aware of the emptiness in my pussy.  
Chris finally came up for air, stroking my thighs and smiling down at my panting form. “You’re even more beautiful than I imagined,” he said. “You come like a Goddess.”  
I couldn’t think of anything to say, so I just panted some more, slowly unclenching the fists I had locked in his hair.  
Chris wasn’t quite done with me yet. His hands explored my thighs, my hips, the curve of my ass. Finally, a big, hot finger found my pussy and started to work its way inside.  
I tightened up immediately, and a curious look crossed his face. “You’re so… oh my God, Shawna, are you a virgin?”  
I nodded, feeling my breath start to return. “I’ve… never done… some things,” I explained.  
Chris withdrew his finger, stroking my folds once more before sitting up again. He grabbed my arms and pulled me up, embracing and kissing me, then held me against him, stroking my arm while my body finally started to relax.  
“Why did you stop?” I asked after a minute.  
Chris leaned back to look at me. “Shawna, you’re special. You might be the most… well. You’re very special, and growing more dear to me by the second. If I… I mean, if you’re going to have your first time… it’s not going to be crammed up against a door in the front seat of my shitty sedan.”  
“Hey, I like your car,” I protested.  
Chris grinned. “Good. Because I like having you in my car. But it’s not time for that, not yet. You deserve better.”  
  
We didn’t talk for the rest of the drive, but after a minute Chris reached over and laid his hand over mine. I held onto his fingers, focusing on the heat of his skin and trying not to think too hard about how much I had wanted him to just take me right there in his car. I had more important concerns, like what I was going to do when I finally met the woman who stole my life from me.  
  
“Wow,” I said, “I didn’t know the city still had trailer parks.”  
We slowed down as we turned into the dirt-and-gravel lot. Cheap-looking mobile homes lined the bath to either side of us, some with curious faces peering at us from gaps in equally cheap-looking blinds and curtains. Unwashed children ran in the yards. The whole place was oppressively poor.  
There was a big double-wide at the end of the road, looking like Castle Shit of the Kingdom of Craptopia. Chris parked his car in front of it, just as three very large, very hairy men walked out of it toward us.  
Chris killed the engine and stepped out of the car. The man in front, an imposing swarthy mass of muscles, body hair, and eyebrows with a sharp roman nose, addressed him before he could speak.  
“You are lost, city man,” he said sternly. “You should turn your car around.”  
“I can’t do that, friend,” Chris said, leaning one of his large arms on the roof of his car. “The lady has some business with you folks.”  
I got out of the car and closed the door. One of the men said something in a language I didn’t understand and spat on the ground in my direction. I raised a brow, trying to look unintimidated. “I’m sorry,” I said, “I didn’t understand that. Should I be offended, or flattered?”  
“He thinks you bear amriya, a curse, and spits to keep your evil spirit at bay,” the leader explained, trying to stare me down. “I think he is right. You have no business here.”  
I stared right back at him, refusing to back off. “Lyubitshka Tokar will disagree.” I had practiced saying the name. “Tell her that Shawna Milner is here, and that I intend to take back what she stole from me.”

I love working with children and adolescent and I really wanted this job. I never heard back from them and left overseas in July for my internship, so I'll never know if they ended up trying to reach out for me. I applied again in late August for the same position and waited and waited. I called a couple of times to check my status and every time, they said it was being reviewed. I was getting anxious, because I had some experience working with this demographic, it's what I'm getting my degree for, I had great references, I didn't know why I wasn't getting called back. 


Eventually, I just gave up. As much as i really wanted this job, I also really needed a source of income, so instead, I found a retail job. Well, a couple of weeks ago, a friend of mine, who also works at the children's home told me she sent in a referral for me and that they would like to interview me. 


I really want this job but I don't want to be seen as unprofessional with my current job that I've only had for one week. 


Would I be in the wrong by leaving this job that I just got for the one I want?"

There are three in Omaha, NE and two in Bloomington, IN. I'm transferring to the Omaha office in two weeks, so my position in Baton Rouge, LA is also open for immediate employment. They are looking for 2+ years experience for that one, but I think they would be open to people with internship experience or an MS degree. This is a throwaway account since I don't think it would be hard to figure out who I am, but I'll monitor it for a while in case anyone has questions. Best of luck to all of you!"

He looked at his phone and remembered some of the interns talking about a dating app, something ending with an R. Apparently you would swipe until you found someone who didn't find you repugnant. Then you would exchange messages and then ideally, they wouldn't be be mean or try to drag him into a van or not like him. Ideally, Norman wouldn't need Norman anymore.

So Norman went to the appstore and tried to remember the apps name. He tried a few things, installed some malware and an app involving an aggressive bunny. Then he found a dating app called Grindr and since it sounded right, he installed it.

Norman saw a bunch of men and realised he didn't have a profile, which is why the app was showing him the wrong people. So he filled it in and explained himself and what he wanted.

He spent ten minutes fiddling with the lamp and the selfie camera that kept going away, trying to get a good profile picture. Half of the uploaded pictures were of Norman sulking in a corner for better cat food.

Eventually the profile was done. But still no women.

Then messages from men, Norman responded promptly and politely, quietly hoping to get an explanation as to why he couldn't see any women.

A 34 year old ""top"" named Ricki explained it to him between exhibitions of his girth. Ricki invited Norman over to explain it better.

Norman learned alot about himself that night."

After my first published short story Head Creeps garnered a small following, I had met Megan working as an intern for DarkHouse Publications. Mort had introduced us at a small office party that was celebrating the publishing house’s new horror line recently introduced. The excitement was overwhelming, and my nerves were strangling my enthusiasm. I had been new to the game and increasingly nervous about starting my next story, the small amount of fame I had received carried my insecurities to the surface, as well as my love of the drink. 

I had been cold to that beautifully soft voice of hers at first, but her reassuring smile and her eyes, as blue as the ocean and seemingly just as deep, calmed me as if some black magick had been cast over us both. It helped that she had been a fan of my writing, bolstering my ego just enough to get me to relax. We laughed, we shared. We talked into the dying hours of moonlight for the many days to come.

 After a few weeks, we had started dating. It was a love built on understanding, kindness, reassurance, and perhaps too intrusive in my professional life than I thought I needed. Regardless of that notion, she remained a great assistant in the writing of my next two novels, her knowledge of writing and more importantly, reading, proving invaluable.

But, over the years, my writer’s block had become more dire, my bitterness less alieved so easily. There had been many nights my insecurities threatened ripping our living arrangement apart. Her critiques were more bothersome, her ideas clashing with my own. I began to view her with a wary eye, one of spite instead of adoration. 

Her smile, once a beacon in the darkness that rummaged through my mind, hunting blindly for the next twisted idea, began to wane. I had taken a beautiful woman, so giving and enthusiastic over my endeavors, and began picking her apart as a crow would a corpse. I had nearly forgotten the love that she had willingly entrusted to her favorite writer. I was lost in her eyes not swimming but instead drowning. The drinking had hit its worst, at that point. Still, I pushed on through the next novel and the next by spring that year. They were a mixed bag, I thought, but each one sold more than the prior. Rabid fans and literary critics battled over my work, much to her delight and mine. 

After the release of the last book, Bury the Heart, Megan and I had finally began to feel at ease with each other again. I had slowed my drinking, and though she was unhappy that I had picked up smoking as a replacement, we were finally beginning to heal. It had taken her months of continuous pleading to pull me from that dark abyss, saving my life not just once by giving me courage to continue writing through my doubts, but countless times from my own destructive nature.

We finally had reached a peaceful place, more in love than ever. I owed her more than I could ever repay. We announced that we were going to be married. Interviews, morning talk shows and book signings bled into one another as the spring steamrolled ahead. The final city on the book tour before our planned wedding date and much-needed vacation was New York. 

A horror convention where I would take the stage, answering questions on writing or whatever else the adoring fans would come up with, sounded like a perfect way to end the fiasco my personal life and professional life had become. 

It was there, at the last stop of the Bury the Heart Tour, that Megan Leanne Connelly would always be buried as well.

Tina had brought me the bottle I requested, smiling as she did. I reached for my wallet, attempting to pay, but was stopped by her dainty hand on mine. She leaned in close to my ear, catching me off guard. She laughed at my reaction kindly.


“It’s alright, Mr. King. Consider this a gift for all those nights I’ve spent curled up reading your stories.” She sensed my trepidation, adding that she wouldn’t tell a soul, and giving her condolences for my loss. Thanking her, I hastily made my way to the door.


“Is that old book store closed over there, sweetheart?” I asked, pointing across the street.


“Closed about an hour ago I think. The old lady that runs it is nice and she has quite the collection of books. I think you’d like it. Fair warning in case you do visit, though. She has gotten a little… out there… the last few months. Old age and all that. She used to give card readings on the weekends, really playing up that Romanian heritage. Tourists love that stuff. Thank you again. Stop in anytime if you need an ear.” She winked. “Or more...” She smiled, tossing her blonde curls and making her way to the kitchen.


Lovely as that invitation seemed, I had a previous engagement with that old sky blue lover of mine. I could hear the typewriter whispering to me and felt a tad more inspired than before. It had always been better to write while the words seemed tangible.


I stumbled to the Jeep and headed back to my wooded hideaway, determined. Megan followed me there as well, nestled quietly beside me in the form of a bottle of liquor, equal parts muse and poison, but irresistible all the same. 


Upon arriving, I dared not look at that lake. I could smell that faint hint of lilies in the air, and had no time for such imagined distractions. I started writing with every intention of not succumbing to the drunken hallucinations of the previous night. I wrote in a feverish stupor and the words flowed as easily as before.


I stopped writing a few hours later and began reading it over frantically. My eyes started to get heavy, like the stones tied to the ankles of a witch accused and forced to swim. I struggled a bit, but I sank. Dreaming, I drowned in the final moments Megan and I had shared in New York.


The gun is shaking in my hand as I fire not once but three times. One bullet hammering against the hotel room wall, the second exploding the back of her assailant’s head as a wild ribbon of blood spirals out in some grotesque flower of brain matter and red. The third is a mistake.


I see her eyes wide in fear, screaming my name for help. In my anxiousness I fire that last bullet as his head starts falling to the side from the killing blow. I see her face, I hear her scream. The gurgling comes next and that horrible sound is only matched by the sight of those deep green eyes dimming and rolling back into her head as her skull gives in, the wall behind her staining as red as her hair.


I rush to her side, screaming. I scream. I cry. Nononononnonononono


NO.


I cradle her head in my arms, the neck limp and sliding her face to the left and right like a morbid Slinky as I sob. I cry like a child the tears never stop. I shake I scream she’s dying she’s dying she’s dying


She’s dead. I know this. No pulse no breath. I killed her. I killed her killed her kill kill kill dead dead dead 


I press my lips to hers I press and press lips her lips so red so dead I breathe please breathe please god please breathe


She won’t. She never does. Never will. I know this but I press and press. My lips her lips I breathe but she won’t.
 

Never will.


I dream this a thousand times. She dies. My hands are sticky, bits of the grey mess that was the brain of the woman I love spilling in tiny chunks as I shake her, her eyes rolling open please please just open just once just open please Megan Megan Megan 


I kiss her lips her lips my lips I breathe she doesn’t


SHE NEVER WILL 


Among the bodies and the brains and the blood, I always kiss her. Breathe into her. Gasping for breath, I breathe harder and harder. I breathe and she doesn’t.


But if I keep breathing, keep kissing, keep shaking….


She HAS to eventually.


I cradle her, her hair is matted with the gory mess, my hands are shaking and shaking as I kiss and kiss and kiss her dead red lips and breathe and breathe and breathe….



I sat up straight in bed my hands violently cradling the dead air about me. Drenched in sweat, my pillow damp with tears, I sobbed. The scent of lilies filtered in through the open window, the fragrance itself seeming to choke the few fragments of light inside my darkened bedroom. I laid there weeping into the stained pillows for the rest of the night.


As I slipped into unconsciousness again, I focused on the breathing and welcomed the silent blackness of dreamless sleep. For the first time since New York, the breathing hadn’t been solely my own."

It's a small video production &amp; post-production company (4 full-time employees, a couple freelancers and interns) and for the past two years has not been doing well as we lost a couple of our key accounts.  I've been taking on any freelance side work that doesn't violate my non-compete and am considering leaving to pursue more freelance work and a plan to grow my own company if I can find my niche.

My experience with this company has allowed me to develop an ability to do a ton of different things like tech support, copy writing, sales,  even web developing and coding (mostly because it otherwise wouldn't get done) I can do photo retouching, computer repair, sound design, graphic design, etc.... and even though my passion is post-production (editing, and special effects) I'm tempted to market myself very broadly or market different skillsets to different markets instead of identifying a niche to focus on.

The issue is having too broad a scope is in part what led to my current company's failure. I guess what I'm asking is, how do you identify a niche to focus on, specifically when it comes to marketing?"

This morning I broke up with my gf of over 1 year. She has been my first girlfriend ever. Yesterday she got mad at me because I had deleted a conversation on Facebook with a girl that used to be in my class (that was barely a friend). I had only talked to this friend once on Facebook, and only to ask what happened as she had just broken up with her boyfriend (who's still in my class). 

Anyway, my girlfriend regularly sniffs through my facebook (which I hate, but apparently that's normal in her girl circles to sniff through their bf's facebook and that exchanging passwords for email is expected). So she saw that the conversation was empty, even though I had mentioned to my gf that I had had a conversation with this girl. So she gets angry and kind of pushes me off, as I try to (as always) be the accommodating person and try to explain and say ""I love you, don't be angry, let me explain."" She got kind of over it, but I felt quite clearly it still troubled her. It troubled me more so that she didn't trust me, even though she's giving me way more reason not to trust her and I never said a word about that (She told me recently how she'd gone to a guy's place after me and her had a little argument, but she claims she only talked to this guy, despite the guy not being a close friend or friend of hers at all. Also last tuesday she asked me to come over, but I had spent a lot of time with her the week before so I told her I'd come over on wednesday (as we had planned before), which apparently prompted her to message the guy saying ""I'm lonely and that makes me sad"", which ended in him asking to have sex with my gf. She confessed all of this to me as to 'avoid misunderstandings' because she wants to be honest with me, but the entire situation was fishy. But like the always too nice guy, I sucked it up and continued to make her happy.

Anyway, I digress, and I'm sorry for rambling but I can't type coherently. I was doubting this relationship from the very start, but I thought (since I'd recently been diagnosed with mild ASS), I might be source of the problem and not her. We had some really good times and she opened a lot of doors for me, making me from a shy introverted nerd into a less shy introverted nerd. However, she was/is very controlling of me, constantly checking who I talk to on facebook, who I do assignments with (I study psychology, so many of my peers are female). A few family members of hers have systematically told me I should ""stick up more for myself around her"". She got upset easily and stressed out for her education. I have always tried to help, with everything, brushing aside my own feelings just to make her feel better because I really did want to make her happy so much, seeing as she did have a few things to be pitied for (bad relationship with parents, trouble in school with assignments, dyslexia, very stressed out, always planning things, history of self mutilation, just lost a majority of her friends). 

But she was also very controlling over me. For example, I don't have any friends or any hobbies (besides gaming), so when I suggested (on the suggestion of my psychologist), that I could do volunteer work once a week to work on my social skills, she basically got a little angry about how it'd impede on our time together. I understand, and she has told me, why she always wants to be with me. I was her getaway from a household she didn't feel welcome in, I was her prince taking her away and to start a life with, just the two of us. 

Now that I broke up with her, I feel an enormous amount of guilt over it, but I just couldn't handle it anymore. I just imagine her being borderline-suicidal, seeing her dreams with me collapse. She guilt-tripped me quite a bit during our break up how she'd kill herself, or quit school, not go on her foreign internship next year... I know my story is full of red flags (and it's not the full story), but it doesn't take away that I feel so incredibly guilty about leaving this vulnerable, young woman who thought she could be with me forever. Can anyone relate, please? I just need someone to talk to. And I'm sorry for the ramble.

TL;DR Broke up with controlling and sometimes emotionally abusive girlfriend of 1 year, feel very guilty about leaving her because I know how vulnerable she is without me"

It was older and we just replaced it but I asked if I could set it up with  a trial so I could learn the installation process of the various components. 

After oppening it up and installing a new CD drive, fixing a few fans, and installing a new raid card, I began the instalation of 2012. While that is going, I was wondering if any of you redditors here know of a good guide to go through the various aspects that possibly teach along the way. For example after setting up the basics, where do you go next with Hyper V, what about advanced settings, Active directory, Exchange servers, etc. If there is not one comprehensive guide thats fine maybe just a list in order of things to tackle first. Even just a text list of what I should be doing to maximize what I learn from this.

Sorry just a beginner so I am looking for some guidance since my boss is busy for the next few days."

Fuck I am wet. I'm going to need some help working through this. :) She is going to be such a distraction to me. 

She is definitely on the young side for our interns from her looks. Usually we only take people about to go into grad school, but she has to be way younger than that. When she was introduced to me in my office I was just engulfed in the mix of smells from her. None of them were strong, but they melded together into something that was driving me insane. I wanted to lead her by that soft little hand of hers to my desk and give her a good welcoming to our office. Shit, I'm in trouble.

So who wants to play this innocent (or will I find out she isn't so innocent) young intern? 

Are there a couple of us in the office that are struck with her like this? Perhaps we need her to help us in the meeting room? Maybe she is going to help us whether she likes it or not?

Did she get this intern position because she isn't very innocent after all? Who all did she fuck to get here? Does she tell me her story?

This doesn't have to be rollplay either. We can just chat about what we would do to her. That works too. Mostly though, I just really need to rub this out. Anyone want to help? :)

3qbwro,2,2015-10-26,My parents are encouraging me to dump my legally blind boyfriend. Advice?,Tatiana1001,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/3qbwro/my_parents_are_encouraging_me_to_dump_my_legally/,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 2 years (we're both 21.)We love each other very much and have talked about moving in together soon and possibly marrying each other one day. The only problem is that my parents are against it because he is legally blind (he has Stargardt Disease-which is a genetic condition that causes macular degeneration and progressive vision loss. There is no cure.) My mother tells me that even though he has a very good heart, he will never be financially successful and capable of supporting a family because it'll be nearly impossible for him to get a job that pays well. My parents both warn me that I'll be the one pulling all the weight in the relationship because I'll have to support him financially and accommodate his disability his whole life if we ever get married. 
My boyfriend is very smart and hardworking and is determined to try not to let his disability hold him back. He is currently a computer science major and has a 3.85 GPA. However, I can see some truth to what my parents have said because he has been turned away from almost every job and internship he applied for, and I'm sure it's not for his lack of trying. He's currently working two part-time jobs as a cashier in a coffee shop and a self-employed math tutor because he didn't receive any offers from the Computer science and programming internship programs and jobs he applied for. I don't want to dump him because his troubles aren't due to laziness. At the same time though, I worry about our future if we do move in together. Advice?"
3qc5m7,7,2015-10-26,Is it unethical for a dietitian to profit from selling a supplement?,datsupplementdoe,dietetics,https://www.reddit.com/r/dietetics/comments/3qc5m7/is_it_unethical_for_a_dietitian_to_profit_from/,"So, I just got my first job as a dietitian a month ago (yay!). And one of my coworkers messaged me, asking me to join some thing she does. She is a coach for Beach Body and sells something called Shakeology. I looked it up, and if you're a coach the website says ""You'll earn up to $105 for every Beachbody Challenge Pack you sell and a 25% commission on all of your other retail sales. And if you choose to build a network of Coaches below you, you can earn even more.""

I am super weirded out by this, and I find this to be completely unethical, no matter what the product is. To me, this is something a ""nutritionist"" would do, not a dietitian. I don't like our credentials being flaunted so she can get more money on the side. I don't care about the product. Any program like this that sells a portion controlled product that you need to adhere to to lose weight is going to work. I just think it's pretty gross that she is profiting from this product... and I am completely blown away she tried to sell it to me.

During my internship I also knew a dietitian who sold Herbalife, I think it was. And both of these dietitians promote these products heavily on facebook, so they get everyone they know to read it. It makes me kinda mad just thinking about it. I think it's one thing to promote a product, like Ensure, for example, because we use an Abbott formulary at my hospital, but to profit is another thing entirely.

What are your opinions on this?

edit: never said anything about losing licensure, just that I don't agree with it"
3qc7hk,2,2015-10-26,Need advice about my situation,Knife_Operator,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3qc7hk/need_advice_about_my_situation/,"I'm a 24 year old male and my only financial experience is with cash and debit cards. I'm currently facing a situation I've never encountered before and would like some input about my current plan to address it.

I will graduate with a bachelor of science in Environmental Technology from a state university on the east coast in December, at which point my plan is to move across the US to the west coast to join my girlfriend who is attending graduate school there. I will have no student debt. I have supported myself through a combination of significant parental aid, financial aid, and part-time jobs. I am currently essentially broke. I had been supporting myself up to this point from the money I had saved from a full-time summer internship, but that has since run out and I have borrowed money from my mother to pay next month's rent. I have been applying for fall internships and part-time jobs since my summer internship ended, but nothing panned out.

I feel like I have a lot on my plate right now between finishing up my final semester, figuring out how to afford my living expenses for the next two months (and transportation across the country), and finding a full-time job in the state to which I am moving. I believe my degree will make me very hireable, but I need to start looking for jobs now in order to try to ensure I will be employed soon after moving.

My current plan, which I would like some feedback on, involves finding some odd jobs to do for spending money, and getting my first credit card for larger expenses. It feels pointless to me to go through the job-hunting process and try to obtain a part-time job with only two months until I plan to move. In the past it has taken me a full month between applying for a job and actually starting it, and this was complete with several personal visits to a manager to express my interest and see if I could do anything to help move the hiring process along. I plan to scour craigslist and sites like sweeps.jobs (anyone have any personal experience with this one?) to find local work like walking dogs, mowing lawns, moving furniture, etc. I'll also look for seasonal positions around the holidays, but they'll have to fit with my class schedule.

Additionally, my sister encouraged me to get a credit card. I know I'm overdue for building credit, but I've never had the interest or really even thought about it seriously until now. I used the search bar and found some very useful posts for introducing me to the basic concepts. I tagged this post with the ""credit"" flair because this is probably the area in which I need the most advice. My plan as far as the credit card goes is to use it to purchase my plane ticket, since I need to do that ASAP or prices will continue to rise as the date gets closer. I will also probably use it to pay my rent for December. I don't believe I will make enough from of the odd jobs I find to purchase these things, and while I understand that it's important to pay the statement balance each month, which I will not be able to do, I'm hoping that I can find a card with a 0% interest rate for the first 6 or so months, such that I can pay the minimum balance without accumulating interest. I know that will cause my credit score to lower slightly, but that's not my main concern right now, as I believe my degree will make me very hireable and once I have a full-time job I'll be able to pay off the balance I have generated pretty quickly and then work on building credit from there. I understand I'm taking a gamble, but I'm very confident that I can find employment within 6 months. So, if my understanding is correct, the attributes I need to be most concerned about when looking for a credit card should be that it has no interest for the first few months, and I need a credit limit of at least $1500 to cover a month of rent ($425), a plane ticket, and possible unforeseen expenses like car troubles or medical bills.

Am I missing anything? Are there any flaws in my plan, or potentially better plans? I'm loathe to continue borrowing money from my mother because she's recently moved and she has plenty of expenses of her own right now. Thanks in advance for reading and for any advice offered."
3qd0gc,9,2015-10-26,I'm [21F] having trouble moving on from long term relationship [21M],Nothinggold206,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3qd0gc/im_21f_having_trouble_moving_on_from_long_term/,"We got together in our senior year of high school. Due to family circumstances on both sides we moved in together after about 6 months, just before starting college. We built a life and a home together, took many vacations, and were deeply in love. We talked regularly about getting married and having kids in the next few years. He asked me often what kind of ring I would like. 
   We had fights relatively often, probably every 4-6 months. He struggled with conflict and tends to shut down emotionally when upset, so I was always the one trying to talk it out and apologize. I was the worse arguer, and tend to yell and cry, probably in order to get a reaction from him, which is dumb I know. But most of the time I felt incredibly happy with him. He told me he loved me every day, and every night when we went to bed he would pull me close and say it was the best part of his day. I wholeheartedly believed I would spend the rest of my life with him. 
   We are both in our last year of college. I am applying to medical school and will most likely take the course at the same college I am currently at. I did also apply to one other (I'm in Canada FYI) but chances are best in my home province. He is very ambitious and does not want to stay here for work. Neither do I, and we visited one of my favourite big cities in the summer in hopes of moving there in four years when my school is done. 
     This past summer we were long distance. He accepted a job in a different province. The kicker was that he didn't ask how I felt about it at all. He said it was too good of an opportunity and he couldn't turn it down. He's not wrong but I still felt like I should have been considered in his decision. He still made an effort for us to see each other and I appreciated it but it was hard. So he came home in September and it was amazing having him back. About two weeks ago, I was getting ready in the morning when he casually called out from the hallway that he was applying to an internship in said big city next summer. It is unpaid and would change our plans completely - he was going to get a job so that he could find us a place to live while I go to school next year (our parents support us up to the end of this year). I got very upset that he again brought something like that up so casually without me being able to have an opinion. He tried to say later that he would have figured it out financially but at the time didn't really have any plan. 
   We went to school and didn't really talk. I decided to wait for him to apologize or at least start the discussion. He didn't really talk to me for about two days other than polite conversation. I was quite upset but sick of always being the one to try and fix things. On the third day, I decided I was sick of fighting. I woke up and wrapped my arms around him, and he did the same. After a few minutes I asked if he was still going to apply. He said yes - it was already a done deal. My feelings made no difference. I'm ashamed of what happened next. I got very upset and said a lot of mean things. I was very hurt and I regret everything. I pushed his arm aside when he walked by me (this was unfair and I don't even know what I was thinking). I was crazy upset. I felt like I was always going to come second to what he wanted for himself and he gave no consideration to my feelings when making big decisions. 
  We didn't talk for the rest of the day. I texted him but he didn't respond. Later that night he came home. I apologized because I felt bad for overreacting. He wouldn't look at me or come near me. He said he needed a break. Nothing like that has ever happened before. I was shocked and didn't want to leave. He left to stay with a friend. The next day I went to stay with my parents. We didn't talk for three days. I tried to respect his space. I left him a letter apologizing and trying to remind him of all the good things we shared together. 
   On the third day, he asked if he could come over the next morning to talk. He was crying and kept saying that he didn't see us being happy together in the future. I tried to say that it was ok if we spent more time apart to grow up a bit and learn to be more independent. I apologized for everything. He said he didn't think we ever had a healthy relationship and he wants to find out what that's like. I asked him if he still loved me. He replied that he doesn't think he's in love with me anymore. He left. I have been devestated ever since. He packed all my things the next day and had some friends move it to my parents house. He hasn't tried to contact me. 
   I've been trying to respect his decision. Contacted him a few times: once to say that I wasn't going to communicate with him through a third person (he had been telling a friend things to tell me), once to send an apology as I was feeling guilty, and I sent a letter that I wrote after a therapy session. The letter was cathartic to write as it covered what I thought some issues were that we both needed to work on to be happy. He said he appreciated it and he wanted me to be happy too. He hasn't tried to contact me at all other than to pick up some stuff from me. So I saw him yesterday to exchange some belongings. I had some family drama going on at the time that I mentioned to him as the reason I was freaked out. He was civil but very distant. I apologized for everything and his reply was that ""I've already forgotten about it"". And then he left. 
   I'm just devestated. I don't understand how he went from being so kind and loving and picking out rings to being so distant and cold so quickly. I can't believe he was able to move on so easily. Talking to friends who have talked to him, they say he still cares about me but not ""in that way.""  I am still in love with him. I can't stop thinking about him. He was my best friend and the only one who really understood me. Now I have no one to talk to. I know I shouldn't be contacting him so I am trying not to anymore. But everything reminds me of him and I can barely keep it together. I lost my best friend, the love of my life, and my home in two days. I would do anything for another chance. I had begged him to go to counselling or anything to help and he refused and said he just can't try any more. I miss him every second. Everyone is acting like I should be able to just get over it because he ""wasn't the one.""  No one understands how much I love him and I don't know what to do because I want him back so badly and he seems to be just fine having no contact with me. I think he is worried that I'm holding him back from what he wants to do. I respect that he is ambitious but I don't want to give up my opportunity to go to school so that we can move somewhere he wants to right away. A friend just told me he is thinking of moving to our big city by himself after graduation. This is really depressing because I can't imagine never seeing him again. I just needed someone to listen.

3qd3mv,4,2015-10-26,[Update] Post-Shroom Trip,Ayoung4u,Drugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/3qd3mv/update_postshroom_trip/,"[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/3peb3h/7gs_of_cubes_for_my_first_mushroom_trip_what_can/)

A couple of you from my original post were curious as to how my trip was going to go, and I figured I could cut out some time to let you know. I originally was planning on taking 7g of cubes for my first shroom trip and going exploring a scenic local area, but the kind users of /r/drugs convinced me to cut it back to an eighth for my first time. This is how my trip went.

At about 4, my friend and I arrived at a mountain overlooking the entire valley where I am from, which is massive and contains many cities and towns. It is about a 30 minute hike to the top, so we ate the shrooms when we were 10 minutes out from the parking lot. We end up parking and start walking up to the top, passing many wary travelers on the way. At this point, everything was happy and I was in a very good mood. We were cracking jokes and having a great time. 

Cut to about 20 minutes later and we arrive at the top of the mountain, which has a bunch of perched rocks at different heights and viewpoints. We walk up to the highest one with the best view and just sit and chill. About 20 minutes later, everything started to get a little wavy for me, but I was incredibly happy still. A stupid smug smile was plastered on my face and I had absolutely no problems at all. The canopy of trees that were stretched out for miles before me were breathing and blending together. The clouds above me became fractal patterns and looked like a checkerboard. The cities in the distance where starting to appear crisp, and I could view every single detail dotting the landscape. I was stunned by the beauty.

It was around 5:30 at this time, and other people were atop this mountain with us. I was incredibly sociable and was very empathetic and interested in the lives of these people, as I was having multiple conversations with them. I was goofy as hell and my friend and I probably looked like a couple happy drunks. 
Some background on me before I explain the next part of the trip: I like to test my body as much as possible. I body build, power lift, run marathons, rock climb, and parkour, and am overall a very spry and healthy 19 year old. 

So, ya know, being on a trip and all, it seemed like a good idea to start rock climbing the side of the mountain. In hindsight, this was a horrible, reckless idea, and is how most idiots die at scenic places like this, but it was where the trip wanted to take me. I climb over the side of the mountain, much to the chagrin of my friend. 
I never had such control over every fiber of muscle in my body. I could feel every crevice on the rocks as I descended down the slopes. I felt superhuman, in short. I have never had such a rush of adrenaline and exhilaration in my life. About halfway down the cliff(30 minutes of solid climbing), I decide to take a break at an overlook and cut out in the mountain. 

I explore the small outcropping, and see a spray painted mushroom on the wall. Believing this to be a sign of the universal will for me to stop climbing down, I sit and reflect on my life while viewing the cities in the distance. Never have I been so sentimental. I call my mom and thank her for taking care of me by herself when I was younger, and tell her how much I love and appreciate her. I call my grandparents, and thank them for the all the times they had perfect advice for me and thank my grandfather for teaching me how to be a man. I analyze every decision and problem in my life and feel utterly at peace.

Finally, I call my ex girlfriend who I broke up with three months ago. We ended on good terms, and I wanted her to know that no matter what happened to us, I cherish the memories we had together and appreciate every moment we had together.

By this time, I am guessing my friend probably thinks I died, and the sun is starting to set, so I climb my way back up to the top. About 100 feet down from the ledge, I stumble upon a Hispanic man smoking a blunt, and he offers it to me, while repeatedly calling me a crazy climbing gringo. By this point, I didn't question the oddity of the situation, sat next to him, and smoked a blunt with him, reflecting on my life decisions. The internship piss test couldn't be farther from my mind. 

I finish the climb as the sun is setting, and now I'm stoned and tripping. I see my friend sitting on a rock, so I plop next to him and stare out at the beautiful, multi-colored sunset that is plastered across the sky. The clouds are blended together in a magnificent display of purples, oranges, and yellows. The cities are brightly lit now, and they appear to be connected via lights. I realize that these are roads and cars lights connecting them, and am amazed by the marvels of humanity and what we have accomplished as a species. 

We stayed at the top for about an hour more, slowly coming down from the trip, while witnessing the beauty of the skyline lit up. Walking back down the mountain, we pass a man who has a pit bull. The dog ran up to me, tail wagging, and I began playing with him and petting him. The owner called him back, but the dog looked at me solemnly, and I swear it wanted to leave with me. It tucked it's tail between its legs and walked back to its owner, who was grilling me hard and they both left the other direction.

My friend and I got back to his car, and we drove to Wendy's, where I had the greatest frosty ever. I still, to this moment, have a new found appreciation for nature and the marvels of man. I also have a new respect for my body and it's capabilities, and am now driven to test it's limits. I'm actually heading to the gym now. I love you guys, and I thank you for suggesting to me to cut the dosage in half, less I may be dead right now.

So yea, I'd say I had a good ass trip.

So I'm essentially looking to finish quickly, but as well I would like to enjoy the place I live in, be able to walk and bike around without a car, and you know, escape the drought...
Before I completely follow through and transfer, I just would like some student/alumni accounts, so here's a few questions -- answer whatever you can:

* Are there are lot of internship opportunities? Work-study?
* What is the engineering/computer science department like? How are the professors/faculty? The facilities? What languages are they centered in? Are there a lot of resources, tutors available?
* Have you ever studied abroad (as a transfer)? How easy is it to get into, and how does it translate credit-wise?
* How are the student organizations on campus? (Film, Asian, volunteering opportunities, etc.)
* How is the Asian cuisine/community up there?
* How are job prospects after graduating? As CS/CE students, do you feel like you left prepared with an adequate background and skill set for the industry?
* What exactly does one do in the Urban Honors College? I love Urban Studies myself, but I'm pretty unfamiliar with it. Can anyone join?
* Where is the best place to live off-campus/without RAs?

Thanks!"
3qd5sa,9,2015-10-26,Feels like kind of a silly question to ask -- question about eating/cooking at the firehouse.,ObiWanBiscotti,Firefighting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Firefighting/comments/3qd5sa/feels_like_kind_of_a_silly_question_to_ask/,"Hey, everyone. I'm not expecting a particularly positive reception to this question, but I have to ask it.

I'm a new EMS/fire student, looking for a career change after working quite a while in an emergency department and as an intern with a medical examiner.

I'm also a vegetarian.

This is something I tend to be very private about. I don't tell people unless I need to (example, if someone invites me to their house for dinner I let them know and ask if they would like me to bring a dish for myself). I don't advertise it, I don't get in other people's faces about following my lifestyle, and so on and so forth. I'm not preachy.

However, it's a very important aspect of my life and it's not something I'm willing to compromise on. I'm a great cook, and I never get complaints from anyone (including meat eaters) about the dishes I make... but I'm not cool with picking meat out of a dish, and on the other side of the coin I'm not comfortable cooking meat either.

I'm more than happy to bring my own food and eat on my own, rather than eat what they're cooking. I just don't want to start anything out on the wrong foot and wanted to get some perspectives.

I did check to see if this question had been asked and found one thread from a year or so ago, but I wanted to check back in and see if anyone else has anything to add."
3qd6fi,2,2015-10-26,I [21 M] feel I'm being kinda stalked by my ex-best friends [20 F] group of friends. Can someone try to make sense of this situation?,stalkingexfriends,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3qd6fi/i_21_m_feel_im_being_kinda_stalked_by_my_exbest/,"A long time ago, Bob [21 M] and his girlfriend Mary [20 F] broke up because Mary developed feelings for me. Me and Mary became best friends after that but eventually when I realized I didn't see any future (because Bob is always around Mary and I don't think Mary fully moved on) I decided to stop talking to Mary and let her and Bob be together in peace. I left the entire group of friends for a very long time - never talked to any one of them, including Mary. Mary Hated me for this because we used to have such a good friendship, and now whenever we see each other (4 times a year), we don't even talk - as if we never even knew each other.  After I left, Mary and Bob started dating again. Bob hated me the entire time, but no one really knew that the reason I disappeared was because I didn't want to get involved in Bob and Mary's relationship any longer (I never told anyone this, including Mary. The reason I gave Mary wasn't even the greatest - can't remember exactly what it was).

I'm back in university now after my 1 year 6 month internship. I'm pretty sure Mary still hates me for basically disappearing like that. I know Bob and Mary are going out again but I don't think they know that I know. I have no idea what Mary fully thinks of me but I know Bob and Mary's friends (who are Bob's friends) hate me too.

With that said, I was sitting at the front of the university library yesterday studying. I notice Bob come and look at me (first time seeing me ever since I left for the internship). We make eye contact (I don't think Bob expected me to look up when he was staring at me) and Bob shook my hand and asked how it's going. After I say good, I ask him how he's doing and he says pretty good, says how life is hectic. And then he walks away.

Next, I notice him and a friend walk out and back into the library across me (I was sitting near the only entrance / exit in the library). Then, from the corner of my eye, I notice another one of his friends come and stare at me for 2 seconds (call this friend Stalks) and then I notice him come and sit on the couch beside me and pull out books to pretend to study (I'm saying pretend because he kept looking in my direction).

I think it's weird, so I decide to walk out for a bit to see if he follows. Right when I walk out, I notice him pull out his phone. I turn and walk back in because at least he didn't follow me so whatever.

He puts his phone away when I sat back down, and he continues to look in my direction every so often. Awkward. This continues for 30 more minutes, and eventually, I start thinking:

""Okay, so Mary and Bob go to this university. This is the first time they are seeing me after very long. I don't think they know that I know they're dating again. Maybe what's happening is, Mary is inside the library and doesn't want to see me (for some reason) so they are waiting for me to leave so that Mary and Bob can leave (note that I was sitting in front of the library near the entrance. Also note that it is 7:30pm so people bussing home generally leave at this time). That is why Stalks pulled out his phone right when I left - so that he can text Mary / Bob to say that I am gone so that they can leave. 

I wanted to verify this, so I decide to get up and walk to the washroom for a minute (to give Mary and Bob time to leave). Right when I walk out of the washroom, I see Bob talking to Stalky (beside my study area). Stalky looks at me and right back at Bob and then Bob walks super fast out of the library and takes a right turn. To confirm that Mary was inside the library and was waiting for me to leave to walk out, I decided to walk out quickly too to see if Mary is out there - I see Mary walking away as well.

I try to continue studying but Stalky was still there and it was so awkward so I left. I notice that Bob's friends kinda stare at me for a second whenever I walk across them. Me and Mary never exchanged eye contact yet ever since I went back to university a couple days ago.

So, what do I do about them awkwardly staring at me (I'm pretty sure if I call Bob's friends out on it, they'll pretend like nothing is happening)? How come Mary did not want me there when walking out? It's weird because Mary could've walked behind me, but she decided to wait 40 minutes just to not risk being seen by me. Any idea why, and what I should do? The campus is small so I come across Bob's friends often.

**tl;dr**: Mary and Bob broke up because Mary developed feelings for me. Me and Mary became best friends after. Bob hated me and continued to try to hang out with Mary. Mary continued having feelings for me but never really stopped hanging out with Bob so I decided there is no future with me and Mary (because I don't think she fully was over Bob) so I decide to leave the entire group of friends (I didn't give a proper explanation as to why I left either. Just felt there is no need to be in between Mary and Bob any longer). Never talked to them (including Mary) for 1 year 6 months (I went on an internship). When I left, Mary went back to Bob and they started dating again. I don't think they know that I know they are dating again.

I'm back in university now, and while sitting near the entrance of the library, I notice Bob and his friends looking at me. Bob's friend (Stalky) comes and sits near me and pretends to study, staring at my direction. I walk up and leave to see if I get followed, and I notice Stalky pull out a phone to text someone right when I leave. I walk back in fairly quickly because I left my laptop there (and at least he didn't follow me, so whatever). Stalky continues staring at my direction for 30 minutes. I decided to go to the washroom for a minute just to see what they'd do. When I walk back from the washroom, I see Bob talking to Stalky. Stalky sees me come out of the washroom, tells Bob something and Bob then immediately walks out. I walk out too to see what's up and I see Mary walking away from the library as well. Turns out Mary waited 40 minutes for me to leave just so she can walk out of the library (when she could've just walked behind me. She didn't even want to risk me seeing her). Any idea why you think so? 

Every time I walk around campus (tiny campus), I notice Bob's friends just stare at me for a bit. It's awkward and annoying (especially if I'm trying to study). What should I do? If I call them out, I'm pretty sure they're just going to pretend like nothing is happening, but it's still quite distracting and annoying when I'm studying."

That being said, is it appropriate to reach out to my recruiter and request to interview for FSO TAP despite having interviewed for FSO audit for the first rounds? How should I ask/approach her? 

If it matters at all, I was referred by a partner and the recruiter was very proactive in making sure I applied to the firm.

3qdu06,59,2015-10-27,3 months pp. Birth story,Gatsby1012,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/3qdu06/3_months_pp_birth_story/,"I haven't been on this subreddit since my daughter was born but I saw another 3 month pp post and wanted to share my experience too.  Reading this subreddit got me through a ton of hard times. 

My daughter was due July 11th. By the time I got to 40 weeks I was miserable. I felt sick all the time. I couldn't get comfortable. I was peeing every 30 minutes. At my 40 week appointment I was dilated at all. My ob asked what I wanted to do. I knew I didn't want to go past 41 weeks just because I was so miserable. We scheduled my induction to start July 16th. My ob then informed me that she would be on vacation. Luckily I felt pretty indifferent towards my ob so it wasn't a huge deal. 

I was a nervous freaking wreck leading up to my induction. I cried when I left my 3 dogs to go to the hospital.  We got to the hospital and everyone was so nice and made me feel really relaxed. The first nurse I had was also pregnant and for some reason that made me feel more calm. My mil is a nurse and used to work with a few of the nurses that were there and my husband is a resident at the hospital. Everyone that knew my mil and husband would stop by and talk to us so that kind of helped me take my mind off of what was happening. 

I finally get all set up and the resident came in and explained that we were going to start with me taking cytotec. So they give me a dose every few hours overnight until I hit the max dose. By the time I hit the max dose I was only dilated 1cm. By this point I was extremely discouraged. Not only was I not making progress but I was having to deal with getting my husband to unhook me every 45 minutes to pee. That alone could have made me crazy. So now it's the morning of July 17th and I'm laying there convinced I'm going to have a c section. 

Another resident comes in and tells me they're going to try to dilate me using a balloon. At this point I have no idea what they're talking about but I'm like ok let's go! The nurse asks if I wanted to request an epidural before they started. I knew I wanted an epidural but I decided to wait because hey how bad could it be? I don't know if this is everyone's experience but for me it was BAD. They inflated the balloon a little at a time. At first they had an intern (keep in mind this is July. This guy had been in residency all of 17 days) inserting the balloon. He was as nice as could be but was obviously nervous. I was obviously in pain. My husband asked if he had ever done this before which made the resident nervous. I don't think my husband meant to be rude while asking this. I think he was just upset that I was in pain. An upper level resident came in and inserted it and it was way less painful. The actual inflating sucked though. 

After the first round of inflating I  asked to get my epidural. It took 3 times to get the epidural in but once it was in it was magic. It was seriously perfect. I couldn't feel anything but I could still move my legs a bit. They come back in a few times and inflate the balloon more but now I can't feel anything. I finally take a nap after being up all night. 

Later they come in and check me and tell me I'm up to 7cm. They take the balloon out and start pitocin. It was really crazy watching the insane contractions the pitocin caused. Seeing it on the screen but not feeing anything was strange. They check me every now and then. Family comes and visits and hangs out with us in the room. As the night went on I started to feel different. I still couldn't feel the contractions but i started to feel really horrible pressure. When I got the epidural they told me it would block the pain but I would still feel pressure. I 100% did not understand what they meant by this. I was like hey how bad could the pressure be? It was the worst pain I've ever felt. I very dramatically told my husband I was going to die. Turns out the pressure was really bad because she dropped really fast. After what felt like hours of pressure I started to throw up. The nurse comes in and excitedly tells me I'm in transition. She gets the doctor to check me. They tell me I'm almost there and start getting the room ready for me to push. At this point the pressure is so bad I feel like I'm going to pass out but then something happened. I went in to some weird trance/meditation. I have very little memory of what happened after this. All I remember is them telling me that most second time moms only push for around 15 minutes and that first time moms usually push for a while. Apparently I took this as some kind of challenge. Once they told me to push I was in the zone. They would tell me when I was having a contraction (because I still couldn't feel them) and tell me when to push and when to take a break. After pushing twice I asked if it was really necessary to wait for a contraction. They said if I really wanted to push I could. I pushed for about 13 minutes total. This might sound weird but pushing against the pressure felt great. The second she was born all of the pressure went away and it was AMAZING. I tore a little but I didn't know that until they told me. 

Phoebe Harper was born at 11:59pm on July 17th. 27 hours after my induction started. 

Some other random thoughts:

-When she was first born I knew I loved her but I didn't feel some immediate crazy bond. It wasn't until around 6 weeks that I really felt a bond. In the beginning I wasn't even really sure what to do with her. I have a video of me talking to her and I'm basically petting her like a dog. Watching that now I have no idea why I was doing that. I'm now obsessed with her. I didn't know I could like a another human this much. 

-the stitches weren't nearly as bad as I expected. Just mildly uncomfortable for a few days. The day after I had her I actually felt pretty great. Everyone seemed amazed at how well I was walking...which seemed really weird to me. 

-nothing is weirder than having your mil see your vagina. My husband was the only one in the room for the birth but my mil felt the need to
stay in the room one time when I was being checked. 

-breastfeeding didn't work out for us and I still feel horrible guilt about it. No one could have prepared me for that guilt. I tried everything. I constantly smelled like maple syrup from the fenugreek. I pumped like a crazy person. My milk never really came in. My daughter was losing weight like crazy. I wasn't sleeping because of the crazy rotation of attempting to breast feed, then bottle feed, and then pump. I made it to almost 3 weeks before having a mental breakdown and deciding pumping 8 times a day to get 1oz total just wasn't worth it. 

-I went in to the hospital Thursday night and was released Sunday afternoon. My husband was off Friday-Monday. He was only home with us one day before going back to work. At the time I was really upset about this but looking back it was actually great. My husband works a ton and having to adjust to being alone with the baby quickly was super helpful. 

Sorry for the novel and the messy format. Bless your heart if you actually read all of this.

I've sort of fallen in love with the regional. It's a really young, hip office that is focused on millennial career development. They have a great reputation in my market and they pay the same as Big 4. I know I would enjoy working there and have already developed good relationships with a couple of the employees. 

That being said, I also have an offer with a Big 4 in risk assurance. In theory IT auditing interests me more but I know I would most likely be doing internal control stuff and that I might be a bit more pigeonholed. While I don't feel the same about the culture and employees, I am sure I would get along with them well. I am also a hard worker and do well in high pressure environments so I think I would do well there.

My long term goals are not to make the most money I possibly can, but to enjoy the work I do and make a decent living. I also think I want to make a career out of public and feel the regional would fit me better for that. I think I know what firm I want to choose but I'm scared I will regret not choosing the Big 4. Can anybody that's been in my situation offer some advice? Thanks!"

Was there a writer's strike in the middle of season 5 and the interns had to write the middle season?  

Season 4, particularly 4B is some of the most compelling television I have ever seen.  5A is also very good, culminating in the death of Gareth.

But then, all of the sudden, we're going...back to Atlanta?  To a hospital for a Beth-centric 4 episode arc that accomplishes what exactly?  Pulling the viewer out of the post-Terminus countryside with danger lurking in every shadow to...a cliche hostage swap?  And at the hospital itself we spend 4 episodes learning what? There are rapists in the post apocalypse? We just saw that with the claimers - why the retread?  This entire arc introduces Noah, a character who is killed before the season even ends, and Dawn, a potentially compelling mirror to Rick who dies with Beth in a pointless hostage swap gone bad.  Why, oh why did the writers take us to Grady Memorial and out of an otherwise compelling story post-Terminus?

I want to believe that TWD is striving to be the best TV out there, but the middle of season 5 has shaken my faith.  Filler episodes should at least be used to develop characters that will stay around for a while.  Why spend the better part of 4 episodes developing three characters (Beth, Dawn and Noah) and then kill two off in the hostage exchange before ending the last before the end of the season?  Do any remaining characters grow at all because of the Beth arc?  

Am I missing something here?

Why it had such an effect on the cavernous nerve responsible for triggering erections was a matter of ongoing research. Fortunately for the world Gynodyne Systems already had an implantable device for stimulating the requisite nerves directly that was undergoing FDA testing.  The device was billed as a safer and more reliable erection initiator that didn't have the same health risks as cialis and viagra.  With 95% of the male population unable to get it up, it was raced through the approval process.  

Within a year, all the rich and powerful had one. Within two years at least a third of the first world had them, and by year three the Chinese and Indian tech firms were cranking out copied devices in absurd numbers on the cheap.  Gynodyne Systems, in a charitable act that shook Wall Street, released its patents to the public domain instead of suing.  Reliable erections for all were back.

Rumors began to swirl.  At the centers of power, young women were whispered to have unusual sway. In Washington, London, Berlin, even Moscow and Beijing, young aids and secretaries were seen whispering in the ears of leaders. Weekly World News ran a front page claiming that all these women had been interns at Gynodyne Systems, that they were clones, grown with DNA from the crash at Roswell.  Everyone laughed.

Strangely, the world marched slowly towards peace.  Conflicts were dying down everywhere.  Pundits argued on CNN about whether this was just temporary togetherness in the face of possible extinction or some more permanent shift in policy.  But after the events of July 15th 2018, there was no longer any debate.

The world cup final game was drawing considerable extra attention for being the first final with a woman on the field, let alone one on each team.  At the 80 minute mark, with the score 1:1, every male on the field collapsed, rolling on the field in the fetal position.  The two women jogged to center field and shook hands as the world watched, dumbfounded.  A number of female reporters rushed the field, microphones outstretched.  The two players held each others hands and raised them high.  

""All men must serve!"" they shouted.  Subroutines in 3 billion devices silently activated, pulling in hidden code and data and running it for the first time.  Collectively the men of the world groaned, yelled and then fell over as the devices transmitted a recording directly into their brains of balls being slowly crushed in the fist of a very strong woman.  ""Women of the world,"" they continued, ""Go to your nearest Gynodyne Systems store, and ask to be implanted with the controller chip if you haven't already.  And men, obey your wives, girlfriends or strangers, there is pleasure in obedience.""  And just for a few seconds, the sensation of single handed castration ceased, replaced with that of a warm wet welcoming blowjob.  Three billion men gasped in pleasure before suddenly wincing again in pain.

Most women it turned out, had already gotten the controller chip under the guise of Gynodyne Systems' digital birth control device.  They just had to learn how to set their code-thoughts to trigger the various sensations in nearby males.  Most played back simple pleasurable or painful experiences, one still triggered the original erection routine and another triggered ejaculation with variants for with or without orgasm. But the one that built the marketplace of dreams and nightmares was the recording function.  Activate that and anything done below the belt could be saved and played back at will.

Single men, anxious for release from the now constant physical pain of not serving a control-chip empowered woman prostrated themselves before friends, relatives or complete strangers.  Some had the misfortune of finding the particularly sadistic cabal of black market suffering recorders.  If they were lucky, it was a short procedure.  Most often it stretched on for hours, days or weeks.  Usually even the most recalcitrant males would get back in line after just watching the video their owner had gotten with the purchase, but some actually needed a taste of it before behaving obediently.

Women stepped bloodlessly into the seats of power.  The bill of rights was amended; men were stripped of the vote (since they were too easily manipulated), stripped of their guns (too many suicides), and often stripped of their clothes (the handsome ones).  Everyone lived happily ever after.  Everyone that mattered anyway."
3qf4ws,8,2015-10-27,Currently not sure what to do about two jobs,carawayseeds,SeriousConversation,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeriousConversation/comments/3qf4ws/currently_not_sure_what_to_do_about_two_jobs/,"Hi r/SeriousConversation. I figured I could vent a little about a job dilemma I'm dealing with and maybe have conversations with you all about any of your own job choices! 

I currently work as a community manager for a company. I've been there for about two and a half years now. The job can be a little monotonous from time to time, but right now I'm the only one left on my team full-time and am currently working with an intern. I have a lot more control over what decisions we do now, and my boss - who really doesn't know too much about community management - puts a lot of faith in me to help steer the community. 

However, I have been thinking about leaving it to potentially find something new or to go back to school and work on a master's degree in something I'm much more passionate about (literature, writing, potentially psychology or sociology). I'm studying for the GRE after work pretty much every day and am currently talking with former professors about recommendations.

My former boss who left at the beginning of September for a new community manager job called me last week and offered me an interview with her company to work under her again. The way she talked about the interview, which would be with her, her boss (who is also another former boss of mine!) and their department's boss, it sounded like all I had to do was talk to the head of the department and impress him. After the interview myself and my two former bosses will be going out for coffee. In my mind, it appears like it might be mine if I want it.

It would be something new which would be nice. But I am sans a vehicle now and it's a few cities south of me. It'd take me two hours to get there via public transit and two hours back. And if I plan on getting back to school soon, I am hesitant on how a one year job would look on a resume.

So I am unsure what to do. Do I stay with something that gets boring and monotonous though I have a lot of control now on what to do (and not for much money) or do I go for something that would be more interesting to me but would potentially stay for only a year before I go to school (not even taking in the fact that I'd have an insane commute)?

Have you faced job dilemmas like this? Or any other career decisions?"
3qfch0,8,2015-10-27,In the Press Box - A Report by /u/Bakonydraco and Myself,TotalEconomist,CFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/3qfch0/in_the_press_box_a_report_by_ubakonydraco_and/,"**In the Press Box: The Experience and Lessons Learned**
***

Hello /r/CFB, how have you all been? Today I here to discuss /r/CFB's first experience as official media in the press box, which occurred at the start of season @ the SJSU-UNH game on Sept. 3. I apologize for a late report, but I've been really busy with school and life in the last few months. In any case, let's travel through /u/bakonydraco 's and I first experience as press box media. 
***
**Background:** 

So around July/August I get a message from Bakony asking if I was interested in get media credentials. At the time, /r/CFB just launched its /r/CFBmedia initiative where we sent out folks to report at various Media Days. /r/CFB had finally gained some serious media credibility. As follow-up, bakony managed to get into contact with the SJSU's Hall of Fame Media Director, Lawrence Fan, and landed us an  opportunity: To be official media at a football game (like a newspaper or major sports website). Since I was available to make the game, I accepted the offer. 
We were going to be in the press box. 
***

**Breakdown of the day:**

So after /u/bakonydraco made it through rush hour traffic and found parking in downtown San Jose, we met up at the west gate of the stadium. Once inside, we had up to the press box to meet up with Mr. Fan. Mr. Fan showed us where our seat were located and asked us if we had our gear. Being that this was our first time doing anything media related, we ran with a general routine common on the subreddit: Live Tweeting and updating the game thread. /u/bakonydraco did most of the tweeting through @RedditCFB while I kept tabs on the key plays. At the end of each quarter, we were handed a complete breakdown of each quarter, something that journalist could cite when writing an article. As the game progressed and the Spartans began to pull away, Bakonydraco went to explore the game through a different angle and also talked to the press guys there. After the game was over, we planned to attend after press meeting, but decided to skip on it due to time constraints. 
*****

**Bakonydraco's POV**

[**Images**](http://imgur.com/a/vpute)

Had a fantastic time at Spartan Stadium for their opening game!  Sadly the Bill Walsh Legacy Game between [Stanford](#f/stanford) and [San José State](#f/sanjosestate) appears to be off the schedule for the foreseeable future, but it was nice seeing the Spartans again.  For this game, San José State actually [**gave away tickets**](/r/CFB/comments/3hx6zt/san_jose_state_cant_even_give_away_free_tickets/) to the game, which ended up being fairly full.  

We contacted Lawrence Fan, the Spartans' [**Hall of Fame Media Director**](http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_20917862/longtime-san-jose-state-sports-information-director-lawrence), about covering the game as credentialed media.  After a successful round of Media Days for /r/CFB this summer, it was exciting covering a game from the press box.

The press box was a very different atmosphere from being in the stands, and there were media representatives from a few dozen organizations.  One of the coolest things I hadn't expected was that each quarter interns brought around a 1 page stats summary with an overview of the quarter, which was quite helpful.  I'd love to see more coverage of games by /r/CFB as a Credentialed Media organization, and this was a great start.
***

**Notes for the Future**

Overall, it wasn't a bad first attempt for us media rookies. However, there were things we could have improved upon. First of all, /u/bakonydraco and I felt it would be more interesting to approach games from a focused narrative. For example, if a star player was returning to the field after coming back from surgery last fall then we focus the narrative on his performance. Or say this a new HC's first game and focus on the play-calling. This seems to be a better approach then the run of the mill setup we did that Thursday. In addition, we probably should have brought more than a laptop and phone. As a photographer, this would have been a golden opportunity to bring some of gear.

3qffa8,1,2015-10-27,I [23M] would like to hear your opinions on my story with my ex [23F],Damnpirate,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/3qffa8/i_23m_would_like_to_hear_your_opinions_on_my/,"Hi guys,

I'm going to try to keep it short, since I dont want to bother you with too many details.
So here it goes.

I was with my ex for 18 months. We had been in a long distance relationship (Australia-France kind of distance) for 6 of these month.

Anyway, I was in love with this girl, first serious relationship ever for me, 4th or so for her. But she always told me it was the best relationship she ever had, and nothing compared to it.
I was happy with everything, we had our fights, but in the end, we worked them out and made it work, even with the distance.

She was going to do a 6 month internship in Australia (it was me in Australia before), and we were ready for that. We were ready to overcome it, and at the end of it, maybe try to finally move in together for a while and see how it would go.

So basically, she leaves for Australia... And 3 weeks later, dumps me over skype, out of the blue.
Her reasons were that she was not in love with me the same way she was at the beginning. I was also not manly enough, not confident enough, and not macho enough for her (can't even grasp this one..). She told me she had slowly drifted away from me the past 6 month or so, without me noticing, and without her telling me about it once.

Anyway, I try to tell her that we can fix this, but she doesnt want to, and I'm devastated. It sort of happened without me noticing anything, so as you can imagine, I felt really bad for weeks.

But anyway, I read a lot about these sort of breakups here on reddit and on the internet, talked to my friends, and went no contact from there.
Had my up and downs, but I was finally able to have some good days. Things were getting better.

But 2 month after the breakup happened, she called me, and as a dumbass, I answered. She wanted to know how I was doing and so on. I answered shortly, kept distance with her. As the conversation went on, she told me that she was sad about how things ended between us, and that she didnt have real friends there and felt a bit depressed. I said I couldnt really help her. I asked her if she had any regrets, and she would answer.
She told me (as she started crying) that she didnt tell me the whole truth. And there she said it. She cheated on me, a week before leaving for Australia, with her ex boyfriend. 
She tried to justify it by saying he had all I didnt have. Being manly, confident, macho, and on top of that, he didnt care about her, which turned her on to flirt with him that night.

They slept together. It was at a week-end with her friends, and I wasnt there btw.

Anyway, so she stayed with me for 1 month after cheating on me, not telling me straight after it, not telling me when she broke up with me.

After the call ended, I felt like shit. She tried to apologize by text messages. Trying to justify, to apologize, but never saying anything about getting back together.

I answered only once, and told her how I felt knowing that, saying how disappointed I was, how I didnt know If I could forget nor forgive that.

I told her I didnt need to hear anything more, cause there was no point. And I blocked her from FB right after she answered to that, apologizing profusely again.

And then, 2 weeks after that call, she emails me, and tells me that she wanted to apologize again, and that she wanted to tell me things in case we wouldnt talk again. She complimented on how a great guy I was, how awesome and such, how she didnt deserve me, and how lucky the next girl would be to have me.
How she was sorry that she ruined everything. How she was sorry to hurt me, and that my pain must be so much bigger than her guilt. 
She added that she wanted to talk to me again when I was ready, and that she knew that I needed time since I blocked her from FB. She said that she didnt want for things to stay like that for ever.

I only answered "" I read your email. I need time and space, without news from you. I know you can understand and respect that."" 
To which she replied that ""Ok, if ever I wanted to talk to her again, I knew where to find her"".


So here's my questions. What are your opinions on my story ? Did I make the right decisions up to now ? 
Is there anything I should/could do to feel better ?

I really felt like she was special and wouldnt do that to me, but seeing that she could makes me a bit bitter now. 
I feel like I shouldnt give my trust anymore, cause it caused me great pain.

Anyway, I know I promised to keep it short, so sorry about that ! Thanks if you read through that wall of text. If you didnt, I dont blame you ! I needed to write that I think. Feels good.

Would like some external opinions on that matter.

Cheers, and thanks to reddit's community in general, it has already helped me a ton !"

Some background about myself is that I'm currently in college and discovered NoFap in 2013. I had just come out of a serious relationship that I believe ultimately failed because of my PMO habit. Before I had started M (age 17), I was full of energy and high on life. I was very social and can truly say I had no worries. I was a good student who was involved in a lot of extra curricular activities. But once I started, not even starting a relationship and falling in love with my best friend was enough to convince me that I did not need to watch P.

Slowly but surely, I noticed a drastic change in my quality of life. I wasn't doing well in my classes. I started smoking weed. I noticed that I was unable to ""do the deed"" (I assume from PMO, nerves, anxiety, etc.). Most importantly, I didn't give my girlfriend the respect she deserved. She was someone that truly gave her all to me and believed in me at a time in my life where I felt truly vulnerable. She had her faults at times, but don't we all? She was the type of girl that had set the bar for relationships to come. Once she decided that enough was enough, I quickly came to terms with my actions and discovered NoFap shortly after. 

Forwarding to the present, it took me close to 2 years in order to obtain my current streak. For those of you, that are just starting/on a similar streak, I can honestly say it was the hardest things I have had to do and it's definitely a commendable feat to simply understand that you need to change your ways. Throughout the summer, I attempted to work on myself and focused on juggling academics and an internship. When I returned to school, I quickly noticed that I had more energy and had a better control of my actions. 

I have been seeing someone for about 2 weeks, but after getting to know her, she's someone I think I can see myself with long-term. However, even while I feel the best I've felt in years, and I am confident that I am making progress with each passing day, I still find myself getting nervous and overthinking everything that I have been through. I definitely want to take things slow, since we are still getting to know each other, and I can tell that she would like to as well. I am posting here today to see if anyone has any tips or similar stories on how to get past this.

Thanks for reading! Any feedback/responses are appreciated :)

3qfwen,22,2015-10-27,"I had my first voice therapy session yesterday, and a have a follow up consult for VFS, all in San Francisco and all, so far, paid by insurance. Here's my experience so far. AMA?",Henchman24RIP,asktransgender,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/3qfwen/i_had_my_first_voice_therapy_session_yesterday/,"I'd like to answer any questions that I can about my experience for people, but as I'm currently only one session in, I have little advice on the specifics of voice therapy techniques. 

Around three months ago, my doctor, the rather amazing and quasi-famous Dr Maddie Deutsch at UCSF recommended me to the UCSF Department of Otolaryngolgy for a voice therapy and possible surgery consult. 

A month later I had the consult with Doctor Mark Courey who performs the same VFS surgery that we typically associate with Yeson in Korea, and a speech pathologist by the name of Sarah Schneider. 

The consult itself was, to put it lightly, a very awkward affair. I was brought into a very cold room with a very vertical medical chair in the middle of it. After a small wait, Dr Courey and Sarah came in, along with Dr DiPietro who is Dr Courey's Fellow and learning to perform the same VFS surgery. Having three people stare at you in an awkwardly cold room while they question you about something you're very self conscious about isn't the easiest thing ever.

They spent some time talking with me, asking me about my life, clearly trying to gauge where I was starting out. After the ice was broken, and without much warning of what was about to happen, we moved on. Dr Courey took tissues and held my tongue outside of my mouth, and then proceeded to stick a *very* long medical camera down my throat. 

Right over his shoulder, I got to see my esophagus and vocal chords, *intimately*. It was a bit of a shock since I wasn't expecting it, but with my tongue held gagging wasn't an issue. 

I was told to hit notes while he both slightly squeezed my larynx and didn't. It was difficult, and slightly frustrating, but they both wanted to see how clearly I could hit higher pitches, and to see the overall health of my vocal chords. 

I've always considered myself as having a very deep voice. It's no joke, I could easily pull off a Dr Girlfriend voice from Venture Brothers if I'm requested. They were both very enthusiastic that I was able to hit a pitch well past a gender neutral range. According to them, after therapy I shouldn't feel a need for the VFS, but it would be an option if I wanted it. 

I made a series of appointments with Sarah, over the course of over a month, weekly. I had to wait two months, as the demand for her specialty is unsurprisingly high in San Francisco. I have a follow up consult with Dr Courey in December, after the therapy has concluded. 

Yesterday, I had my first appointment with Sarah. I was certainly quite nervous. I'm self conscious of my voice like many of us are, and karaoke isn't exactly my forte. Once again, there was a surprise person, Sarah currently has an intern (I think, and I can't remember her name. I can update that next week). 

*Yay! Two people to make me feel awkward* I immediately thought to myself. 

Quickly though, I began to loosen up as we started talking. The first real exercises involved finding the highest pitch I could comfortably muster, and that happened to be right around 175hz or F3 for you music peoples. From there we attempted to circle that hum in what could be best described as a loop. 

Then, it moved into humming that while sticking my tongue out, and attempting to say vowels, as in ""mmmma ma ma"" ""mmmme me me."" This felt very awkward, but because both Sarah and the intern were doing it along with me... I didn't really feel that stupid. Two other, exceptionally nice, comforting women, sticking their tongues out at you and making silly noises will do *a lot* to relieve your concerns. 

I have a homework sheet, and have to practice these exercises twice a day. The idea being that we're shifting my natural casual pitch up slowly, as if we're climbing a ladder. 175 though, much to my happiness, is considered within a gender neutral range. By the end of the session I was comfortable at 185. 

The other piece of homework I have is to find words that I will recognize as ""reset"" words. These words have little mental reminders that they need to be said at a specific pitch. They need to be words I say fairly often, but so far I'm a big fan of the concept. I've already discovered that ""interesting"" and ""alright"" easy choices. 

There was a lot of discussion about the characteristics of language that differ between the genders. Women using more detailed adjectives, listening better, the use of sympathetic words and phrases when responding. There was also discussion of using intonation to emphasize words as opposed to getting louder. Intonation definitely shifts and is more fluid with a woman's voice than with a men. It was all extremely helpful, but a lot to take in the first day. 

***So, on the question of insurance.*** 

This is probably of the most interest to people. All of this, including VFS with Dr Courey, is covered by my health plan with Anthem Blue Cross in California. California has protections for transgender care, and the staff at UCSF is adamant about helping it's patience through the processes. One of my prescriptions has been rejected by Anthem, and Dr Deutsch's office has been tirelessly fighting them on my behalf. I haven't had to do anything. 

With a silver level plan which I purchased through Covered California last January (the exchange is open now I believe) I've been able to afford some things I couldn't normally, and the subsidies have brought my monthly costs to lower than I paid when I lived in Texas. 

I called ahead to Anthem TWICE in regards to getting this entire process ok'd, and both times I've been assured that voice therapy is included in my plan as long as it is deemed medically necessary. When I asked the office about that their response was ""duh, of course it is.""

The only surprise cost so far has been the scope which Dr Courey inserted during the initial consultation. Anthem considers that a surgery (bullshit, unless speculums count as surgery IMO) and so it went towards my surgery deductible, leaving me with a $500 bill. Not great, but not the absolute worst thing in the world. 

I hope this wasn't too ridiculously long or too ridiculously rambling. If anyone has any questions that I can answer, I certainly will.

3qfwgo,45,2015-10-27,Season Preview: Entirely too many thoughts from a stranger on the Internet,dangercart,bostonceltics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/3qfwgo/season_preview_entirely_too_many_thoughts_from_a/,"Real basketball is oh-so-close to starting so here's my season preview. Why would you read a season preview from me, a random fan on the Internet? Because you have nothing better to do and are excited about basketball, that's why. Let's start at the bottom and work our way up!

###Youth is wasted on the young

I'm out on a limb saying that the Celtics will likely get more value out of Terry Rozier, RJ Hunter, and Jordan Mickey (let alone if they had given future picks) than they would have out of Justise Winslow. That's based purely on draft history which even says that it's about 50/50 that the Celtics will end up with the single best player from that foursome. I believe Danny Ainge thought Winslow was a top three draft talent so he likely disagrees with me, and many of you probably do too, but history at least is on my side. The little evidence we have from Summer League and preseason hasn't changed my outlook. Winslow hasn't been good, though that means almost nothing.

####Terry ""The Boston Terrier"" Rozier

A lot of people freaked out about this pick when it happened but I wasn't one of them. The late lottery through late first round is basically a crapshoot with not a lot of difference in value between the 10th and 25th pick. There really isn't a ""best player available"" most of the time in that range so drafting for fit/style/opportunity is a reasonable decision. There have also been a lot of people saying that Terry doesn't fit on our roster but we go eleven deep with NBA talent so at what position would a rookie 16th pick have immediately slotted into? From the guys drafted after Terry only Bobby Portis has shown anything more than Rozier in preseason and last I checked we have a few PFs on the roster already.

Terry fits from a skill perspective more than on size or position. We need secondary playmakers (unless you want to re-up Evan Turner after this season) and have a focus on perimeter defense and pushing the tempo from the bench. Terry has flashed a better shooting stroke than I expected and looks roughly as unable to run an offense as any other rookie PG. Knicks fans are high on Jerian Grant but he hasn't actually shown anything yet, even in preseason, and neither has Delon Wright, though both are two years older than the Terrier. Tyus Jones has looked roughly as good as Rozier, but he's a true PG and with Marcus Smart on board there's more opportunity for a combo-guard. Terry is going to find some minutes on this team unless we stay abnormally healthy. Phil Pressey played 600 minutes last season!

####RJ Hunter

I'm not quite as high on RJ as others. I think he has the best chance of breaking into the rotation because we don't have a ton of shooting on the wing and his playmaking is a nice added bonus. However, he didn't shoot well his last season in college, didn't shoot well in Summer League, and didn't shoot well in preseason. At some point the shots have to go in instead of just looking like they will. I believe they will, but I'm not certain of it.

####Jordan Mickey

Play like Brandan Wright, practice like Serge Ibaka. Mickey can make a career as an undersized rim runner and protector like Wright has but if he wants to be more than that he needs to develop some shooting touch from the corners.

I expect him to put up some Fab Melo-esque D-League triple-doubles but he could also carve out a bit of time in Boston if we have a rash of injuries or trades. The best thing you can say about what he's shown so far is that playing 10 minutes with Jordan Mickey on the floor actually doesn't sound so bad.

####James Young

Coming out of Kentucky James seemed like a high upside pick with some star potential. He's still the youngest player on the team but I think that ceiling has been revised down quite a bit. He has the tools to be a really good 3-and-D player but we'll see if the mentality and work ethic are there to match. With Hunter on the team and a raft of draft picks coming in the next few years, it's probably make-or-break time for Young on the Celtics.

I've made the point before that wings who break in as young as James did rarely fail outright. He's on the lower end of that scale interns of playing time at his age, but that still projects to a useful player. The CARMELO system on 538.com compares him to Xavier Henry, who was just becoming a decent player when a catastrophic knew injury basically ended his career, and CJ Miles. If James can develop into a Miles-like 3-and-D player when he hits restricted free agency in a couple of years then he's a semi-valuable piece to whoever owns his rights at that time. I'm not sure if that will be the Celtics, but I'm still not willing to bet against James being in the league a decade from now.

###Hope is a waking dream

####Marcus Smart
Last year I tried to tell some (non-Celtics) people that Marcus was the team's MVP (because IT didn't play enough games) and I got laughed at. No one is laughing now. We need to revise Marcus's non-injury floor up to ""above average starting NBA guard"" because he's already there. His ceiling is now ""third team All NBA"" and his expectation is ""perennial fringe All Star."" Last year I said I thought he'd get to about the value of Mike Conley, though in a very different style, and I see no reason to change that. I love Marcus Smart and am excited to watch him destroy the souls of opponents who show up thinking a Wednesday night in Boston is just another regular season game to coast through.

####Kelly Olynyk
When he's on the floor the team scores. It's kind of that simple. He's a better defender than he looks (not hard) and those two things combine to make him the +/- King. I see no reason for that to change.

####Jared Sullinger
For this one, I'm on record saying that Jared will win minutes away from David Lee if he gets an opportunity, either through injury or performance, before being traded.

In the larger picture, Sully needs to keep shooting threes (at least in practice) no matter how much you all hate it. Jared Sullinger hitting 34% of his threes is a fringe All Star. If he hits 28%, or gives up on taking them, he's a nice but unremarkable player. The CARMELO system thinks he's our second most valuable player-asset, which makes sense when you consider he was our best player last season (at 22 years old) through the All Star break.

###A problem is a chance for you to do your best
####Avery Bradley
AB wants to take more threes. AB wants to make more of his threes. Why not both?! Realistically Bradley might not be a good enough shooter to have 40% of his shots be threes, and to make 40% of those. I would prefer the former, because I think to get to the latter he would actually have to shoot fewer threes than last season. He's made the right noises about this but still had an annoying habit of taking mid-range jumpers in some preseason games.

Avery Bradley taking 40% of his shots from three, making 37% of those, showing the bit more playmaking he has flashed in preseason, and getting back to hounding the ball on defense would go a long way towards turning my opinion of him around.

####Tyler Zeller
I think we've reached the point where everyone just accepts that Tyler Zeller is good. He's probably the 25th best true center in the league. He's still probably our best finisher at the rim and consistently gets the team off to good starts, even if we don't look for him much at the end of games (except in Utah). He's so efficient that he might make the pairing with Lee work.

####Evan Turner
Ultimately he just has too much utility to dump him for Perry Jones. I'm sure he's one of the players Ainge discussed trading before cutting PJ3 but there are stretches where you watch us and wonder what the team would do without him. The answer is, of course, give the ball to someone else and get along just fine, but he's not anywhere close to as bad as non-Celtics fans would like to believe. He covers a weakness, solves a few problems, and might just have more value to the Celtics than he would to almost any other team. Keep being you, Evan Turner.

####Jae Crowder
One of the more welcome sights of the preseason has been Jae knocking down threes. His form will never be the prettiest but if he's hitting mid-30s% of his threes then that contract immediately becomes a steal. Long term I'd love to upgrade that position and have Jae be a bench option at both SF and PF but for now I'm feeling a lot better about our solution than I was a year ago.

####Jonas Jerebko
You want modern NBA? How about a European three point shooting SF/PF who can also go small-ball center. Is that modern enough for you. Also he has nice hair.

####Isaiah Thomas
Marcus Smart is the key to the future, but IT4 is the key to the present. Adding a player who gives you 30 minutes of superstar usage at All Star efficiency all for the price of a low pick and unwanted contract? That's how you turn a team topping out at 36 wins into a division title contender.

It's nice that Isaiah seems to have come to terms with his role on the team. He isn't agitating to start, at least publicly. He gets to take all the shots he wants up until the fourth quarter and then gets to take all the shots designed for him, which is all the shots we have. Basically he gets to take all the shots. If you're going to score at the rate he does, go for it.

There are lineup combinations that make him basically unguardable. We'll see how much Brad bends the lineups to suit Thomas. We see some of that already with the Amir/Kelly combination joining him on the second unit.

###It's not the years in your life that count, it's the life in your years
####Amir Johnson
Is there an older 28 year old in the NBA than Amir? The last of the prep-to-pros (for now) seems a perfect fit on the Celtics. The consummate professional, Amir fills needs on both ends of the court. He hasn't complained about seemingly coming off the bench. He hasn't said a word about the pressures of having a de facto one year deal. Boston is going to love Amir Johnson.

As long as his ankles hold up. He's looked bouncy and mobile in preseason. If he keeps that up and can play 70 games the Celtics are in really good shape. Fortunately we have the bodies to throw out there where we can limit his minutes to the ones that count.

####David Lee
I'm worried here, but only so much. I know D-Lee made a great first impression running point-forward over in Europe but at his core he's a 32 year old who thinks he's 24. TI think he simply thinks he's better than he is, and that leads to selfish play. Mid-range jumpers, dead end post-ups, flashy passes when the simple will do, chasing rebounds instead of getting back... these are all traits of a selfish player.

If David can keep some of those impulses in check he has valuable skills that can help this team. If not, he's going to lose minutes and it's incumbent on him to realize his place in the league if he does. Everyone on this roster deserves to play. If Brad sends him to the bench, so be it. If he complains too much, or tries to undermine Brad, he's going to fin himself looking for a third team in a year.

Ultimately I think we're carrying him because he's better than Gerald Wallace and his contract could be helpful if a mega-trade materializes. Brad is starting him because he has those useful skills, and he doesn't want to get off on the wrong foot. My guess is that it won't be long before he's spending more time on the bench than he wants but I hope I'm wrong, because for now he's starting and going to get run.

###The show doesn’t go on because it’s ready; it goes on because it’s 11:30.
####Brad Stevens
Has a coach with a losing record ever been held in higher esteem in Boston than The President? [I'll let others talk about his magic](https://www.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/3nv6jz/an_oral_history_of_the_brad_stevens_juvenation/).

####Danny Ainge
I know Danny didn't think this team was ready to take the step forward that they did, but I don't think too many people doubt that he made the right decision. Trading for Isaiah and signing Amir have put this team in the rare sweet spot of both being good, and having a high upside build. It's a tough trick to pull, but it helps to deal with Billy King at the start. The team he's given us probably isn't the one he imagined two years ago but I've got no problem with it. I've made the case that [I think Danny is thinking bigger](https://www.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/3ps6y0/danny_ainge_aims_for_the_stars_and_dont_let/) than most of the fans. That's a rare situation.

In the meantime:

* Woe be to the opponents with weak handles
* Woe be to the opponents with a shallow bench
* Woe be to the opponents with tired legs
* Woe be to the exploitable fools

The Celtics run 13 deep, with two more in the north. The Celtics may own the draft. The Celtics may own the trade market. The Celtics are good. The Celtics, it seems to me, are *fun*."

Well, as fast as a girl can crawl with the ankles and wrists chained up. And of course, she hadn't heard the name 'Arianna' in some time now. She tended to go by Hucow 0021 for the most part.  
  
""Of course, Hucow 0021 was a rather special for us to acquire here,"" Olivia informed Emily, the new intern. ""She was handpicked up our CEO, Scarlett Williams as a personal Hucow. She worked unknowingly with us under the guise of a Secretary whilst we secretly fed her a concoction of lactation-inducing foods. One day, she complained of milk dampening her blouse, we hooked her up to the milkers, assuring her that the procedure would not take long. And that is when we chained her gagged her, and well; you can see the rest"" Olivia beamed as Emily kneeled down to stroke the blushing Arianna / Hucow 0021. Arianna of course remembered the day vividly, however many months ago it was. She would have uttered a complaint, if she were not ballgagged.  
  
The days since working in The Facility blurred into one, however. ""She is usually strapped to the metal apparatus we found her in. A tube in her mouth to feed, a tube at her nipples to milk, and a tube up her bottom to... Urm... Cleanse, enemas, that part isn't quite my speciality."" Olivia trailed off as Emily nodded.  
  
Arianna's blush deepened in shade. The enemas were the worst part of the day, of course.  
  
""And because this little Hucow is just so beautiful, some of the girls come in to her own room during their breaks to play with her; plait her hair, give her a spank, train her how to moo, whatever they see fit! Oh, as long as Mistress Williams approves. Arianna... I mean, Hucow 0021 is her personal cow, after all.""  
  
""So what about the other hucows? Were they all tricked here?"" Emily asked inquisitively.  
  
""Of course they were, silly!"" Olivia admonished back. ""Why do you think we keep them gagged? We offer ripe girls jobs as secretaries, administration, whatever anonymous jobs. After some weeks of controlled feeding, we deem them necessary to Hucowify... And yes; that is a verb."" Emily laughed in response.  
  
""And if they misbehave?""  
  
""Oh, you needn't worry. There is not period they are not tightly bound. But there are some punishments; caning, electrocuting, public humiliation, whatever incentivises them to keep producing. We keep our girls healthy for longevity, so you will notice their breasts do not grow beyond a D-cup at the absolute limit.""  
  
Emily scribbled note in her handbook.  
  
""But what about the boys you capture?"" Emily asked as they approached a double doorway at the end of the corridor. The hair's on Arianna's body stood up as she trailed behind on her leash and collar.  
  
""Watch and learn"" Olivia grinned as she opened the doors to reveal a warehouse with 50 men, all bound to chairs, with identical tubes running through their gags, and into their bottoms for waste.  
  
""We can be a little rough, farming semen,"" Olivia explained. ""Mistress Maisenbacher, our German farm expert specialises on discipline on both Boys and Hucows, but she finds a natural concoction of vitamins appropriate for Cows, and viagra and no visual-stimulus for boys a necessary procedure"".  
  
Upon closer inspection, Emily gasped as she noticed the intense expression of anguish on the Men's faces as they were milked, tubes stimulating and sucking the semen straight from their raging cocks. It was collected through transparent pipework to a tank in the centre of the room.  
  
""Marvellous, isn't it?"" Olivia smiled to herself. ""So, where do you fit into all this, Emily?""

I haven't taken out any loans to pay for it, but I do borrow against my life insurance policy at about $5K. The limit is $10K and I can choose when to pay it back.

I thought I could get an internship or something real quick (I even got an interview for one!) but it or some other job hasn't come down the pipe yet.

(Face palm) I...I ended up using almost all the funds on my credit cards to get my car fixed to get to school, buy other supplies, software, etc. All of the debt has 0% for a year except for about $2K of the total amount. The total amount is about $15K. So $15K in credit card debt plus the $5K borrowed against my life insurance is $20K.

My parents have throw me some lifelines but I don't know how long it can be kept up. I'm too slow to do any other work besides IT stuff because of my metabolism or whatever is wrong with my lousy body.

After an intense discussion of his time management skills and priorities he agreed he should delete tinder and okcupid off of his phone as he navigated three relationships, the GRE, an internship and applying to schools.

While using his phone with his permission, I happened to see he redownloaded the tinder app and he said it was because he reacted strongly to a sad situation and went searching for casual sex.

I'm hurt, sad, and distrustful. I'm totally confused how a desire for casual sex would totally have him ignore multiple conversations about how important it was for him to spend more time fixing his relationships than searching for casual partners. 

Upon confronting him, he still doesn't see the need to take a temporary break from casual sex. I'm at a loss of how to communicate this to him. Right now it feels as though his desire for sex is more important than his relationships which is very hurtful.

3qherl,3,2015-10-27,Advice on standing up for myself vs. intern- say something? or let it go?,ellieohsnap,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/3qherl/advice_on_standing_up_for_myself_vs_intern_say/,"M3 on my surgical subspecialty rotation. It's my 8th day and I scrubbed into my third case with one of my subspecialty's senior residents and an ortho intern who's there for a few months. I spend the first hour or so of the surgery just watching (like literally didn't touch a single thing). Ortho intern leaves. Senior resident asks me to suction, retract for him. Do it. Senior resident is sewing patient back up. Shows me how to throw a stitch and has me do it in front of him. Ortho intern walks in. Senior resident tells him to finish sewing the guy up. Senior resident leaves. I'm suctioning, doing same stuff for ortho intern, when he says he wants to give me some advice, which basically boils down to: ""I know its tempting to want to try to help as a third year, but you aren't really able to do anything during your surgery rotation, and usually you get in the way more often than not, so the best thing to do is just stand in the corner of the room and don't touch anything."" I was shocked- I told him I didn't realize I had been getting in his way, but said yeah, please tell me at the time if you feel like I'm in the way. He replied, ""oh I didn't mean you, specifically; you're doing okay. but just I mean generally, third year students get in the way."" I told him that I understood he was eager to do stuff, since he was an intern, but that since I probably am not going into surgery that this is going to be the only chance I get to see/do any surgeries. I then got really quiet and totally stopped helping with the suctioning/patient care. He then told me again how great of a job I was doing and then tried to teach me some ""special ortho knots"" 

A bit about me- I have been fucking terrified to botch anything in surgery, so have been reticent about scrubbing in, today was literally the first time I actually touched the patient. (I scrubbed in because we were so short-staffed). And so to have an intern wait until the resident (who insists that the staff be really nice to the students) leaves before telling me that in the future I ought to stand in the corner.... it felt really sketch, it's really not sitting right with me. I've been brewing about which of the following options I should go with tomorrow: 

A. Do nothing. Stay quiet. 

B. Ask to speak to the intern. Tell him that if he has a specific nugget of criticism, that I totally welcome it, and that I am a team player who doesn't want to get in the way. But then remind him that I am paying to be here, and that it is my responsibility to learn, and so that I will not be taking his advice to stand in the corner and not touch anything. 

C. Ask the chief resident if he feels that so far on this rotation, I have been getting in the way of the surgeries. He (who can sense my timidness, tells the staff we are friends from outside the hospital and so they have to be nice to me) would ask why I thought that, and I would likely end up telling him what ortho resident said. 

I'm actually pretty thick skinned- if he had a criticism of me that was actually valid, I'd probably be spending this evening thinking about the truth in that, about how I could change for the better. But to imply I'm getting in the way when today is the first of 7 days that I'm touching a patient is complete bullshit, and so I'm tempted to go with option B or C.  

PS. Tomorrow is my last day- Thursday I start working at a different hospital in the same surgical subspecialty (with some of the same residents, but different interns).



**TL;DR: Intern discourages me from participating during surgeries behind resident's back. Should I stand up for myself and say something? **"
3qhiqw,6,2015-10-27,Farewell Everybody,thepaperbear,letsplay,https://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/3qhiqw/farewell_everybody/,"Hey guys! So I want to kind of just say this out front and explain a little more as I go along: I am going to be quitting my channel once my latest playthrough finishes its run (the last episode will go up on October 31).  

It's kind of funny–when I started frequenting this subreddit, I'd see people make the occasional comment that 50% or 90% or 30% or some percentage of the people who were posting right now wouldn't be here in a month. And it's true. I'd go back to posts from a few months before and see people I hadn't ever seen, posting regularly throughout. But I would look at that, scoff and pshah and say, ""Well, that's not going to be me."" And here I am now.

It's me. 

The reason I started my channel initially was to both supplement my love for video games and broaden the scope of my creative endeavors to include something in the video and audio space.  I was a writing major in college. I got a minor in classical guitar. I did a digital illustration internship and am close to a year deep into a webcomic I've been working on.  I have a lot of other things I've been doing for a while. But as is consistent with how I usually operate, I dive into creative things deep; I don't do well at just doing them casually.  

I wanted to only do the videos once a week in the beginning, which turned into once every other day, and then to every day.  It was hard to be content not really going hard at it and I feel like it creeped too heavily into everything else.  

I'm not setting it down because it got too hard or because subs or views weren't what I wanted to see. I'm doing it because the time commitment it's taken to keep it up, even in a form where it is scaled back a lot, has been just too much to keep doing well, along with doing anything else. I enjoy doing Let's Plays so much and I enjoy the community around it, but I've realized as I've planned out the next month and thought through new segments and games, that on my list of priorities, this is my lowest and it's best to just let it go.  

I realize this is coming from someone who has only been here for about a month and hasn't had too much of a relationship with any one person, but this sub has been a really tight and welcoming community and I'm really thankful to have been a part of it.

So good luck everybody. You've all been great and I hope to see you all rocking the top spots one day!"

I'm coming to Cape Town from January to April for an internship. I'll be living in Observatory, probably somewhere on Arnold Street. 

I just told my parents my plans, (I'm 21, senior in University right now) to do this and they have basically deemed South Africa too unsafe for me and have waged an all out sabotage attempt on my plans to go to cape town. 

My parents are especially conservative types, who are all about the ""simple life"" and do not understand the desire to travel and experience different cultures. 

Luckily for me, I have saved up plenty of money to afford this trip with or without their consent, the decision is entirely up to me. 

However, after they brought to my attention how unsafe the country is, I decided to do my own research on the safety.
It does appear that there is a high rate of violent crime, especially in the townships, but it does seem to spill over into the ""safer"" areas of the city at times. In addition to that, there doesn't seem to be a unified police force and the ones that do exist aren't especially reliable.  

So I come here asking you guys, will I be generally safe living in Observatory and working in city centre? 

I want to be able to go out to the bars in Obs at night and not have to worry about getting mugged/kidnapped/etc, and additionally I don't want to have to worry that my house will be broken into when I'm not home..

I hope that most of the reports of violence are just sensationalist media, because the country seems absolutely stunning. Every time I tell somebody of my plans to spend 4 months in South Africa they always jump onto the opportunity to tell me how unsafe it is and that I should re-think my plans. 

Sorry for the long post, it's just a large decision for me and any input will help. 

TL;DR - Offered internship position in CPT, slightly concerned over recent violent crime spikes, strong desire to visit CPT that is matched by strong desire to not be victim of violent crime. "

**Education &amp; work history**

Graduated from Hogwarts. Top marks in DADA, Potions, &amp; Transfiguration. Department of Magical Law Enforcement. Auror.


**Short Bio**

After graduating from Hogwarts, Caroline took an internship at the ministry. What was no more than a glorified errand girl position quickly turned into a stepping stone for her career. 

Caroline had grown up in a troubled household. Her father the defenition of two-faced. To Caroline he was a doting, loving father. To the outside world a criminal. Her mother's death was a result of his secret lifestyle, and at age 13 Caroline became hardened, and obssessed with justice and morals. Her father tried to make amends, he left his old ways, but it was far too late to reconcile with Caroline. They remain estranged to this day.

She knew law enforcement was exactly the place for her and excelled. She worked her way throught the magical law enforcement squad and into an auror position as fast as she was able to. 

After a terrible on the job injury, Caroline was no longer able to work as an auror. Thus, she applied for the Defense Against the Dark Arts position here at Hogwarts. Maybe she could do these kids some good. Maybe she could help protect them. Better yet, maybe she could teach them to protect themselves.

*Caroline approaches the door of Hogwarts. It had been so long. Was she really this old? Her aching shoulder reminded her that she was indeed, this old. She muttered a few obsceneties under her breath as she rubbed her aching joint. The cold always made her injury hurt more, but she was too stubborn to medicate properly. With a huff, she opened the doors and looked around. Nothing had changed. Except her.*

I will try to keep this short and simple. I am 23 years old, going to school for an engineering degree, I am doing an internship/co-op with a big engineering company for some years now, and plan to get a job after graduation (about 15 classes left until graduation). I live with my mom, I pay rent and help her out. Both my mom and dad are old, so I help out as much as I can. I have been dating my GF, lets call her bb8, for about 4.5 years. I love this woman, shes doing very well for herself as well. She has a job with the state and is going to school part time for nursing. 

bb8 has been telling me she wants to get engaged for quite some time now, I keep telling her honestly, that I am not ready for that sort of commitment yet. Two days ago, she tells me that shes pregnant after taking a routine pregnancy test (shes on birth control, and we sometimes use condoms), We get her blood tested, and yesterday she confirms that she is in fact, pregnant. Today I went with her to a specialist, they did an ultrasound, I was standing there the entire time watching, and shes 8 weeks pregnant. We are in so much shock, I almost passed out! I love this gal, I really do. We both come from a working class family, both trying to work towards a better tomorrow. 

Now here is the kicker, after confirming, not even once did she sit down with me to talk about the options we have, I suggested many times to do so. She talked to her doctor in private, and decided that she is going to keep it. I know what she is going through, and it must not be very easy, but I made it clear that I will always be there for her. She has this whole plan in her head, of how she will move out of her parents, and we can both keep on working and tell our parents once were out of the house. Thing is, I don't agree with her ""plan"", if anything, we need all the support we can get, having a baby is not as simple as she thinks. My biggest concern is that, both our educations will be compromised. Shes positive and believes we can make it all work, but reality is, although I get good pay, its just an internship, this baby will require me to quit school (I pay to go to school, my parents don't help me), and get a full time job that pays the best. I have told her this is overwhelming and we should talk to her parents about this, she told me to leave her alone an that she is having this baby with or without me. She has turned into a totally different person. I wanted to graduate, get married and then have kids. I get it, plans don't always work, but this isn't going to work, especially not with both our family's support. She doesn't get that. I am almost depressed, and have no clue what to do, I feel like I no longer have the ability to decide my near future. We have both worked hard, and I know getting an abortion will destroy her, but I would be there for her, to support her. She also said getting an abortion in this state is too late and out of the question...which isn't entirely true





ps- forgive my spelling/writing errors, English is my fourth language



EDIT#1: thank you guys for commenting, and giving me different points of view. I did talk to her about adoption, as some of you suggested, she is not up for that, she does not want to give the baby away. My only option is to at least be honest with both our parents, and hopefully get some support from them because we can't do this alone, we're not capable of affording a baby at the moment, but at least we can try to get some help. So far, I've had no chance to make any decision (not so many to be made), but communication is key, we made a mistake, it happens and now we both need to be adults. Thank you again for your help guys


EDIT#2: I would like to thank everyone who tired to help me, I was very scared at that moment and every comment made me think outside the box. That being said, I realized my involvement, and accepted my child and my new responsibility. I will finish school and give this child everything I can. I was ready to get engaged to my girlfriend, until I found she was talking behind my back about how I am a piece of sh*t father and boyfriend, we stopped spending a lot of time right after I found out, I had mid terms and wanted to get that out of the way, I should also mention, my gf has faked to be pregnant before. About two years ago when we got into an argument and broke up, she lied to me and my whole family that she was pregnant. Which is also why my family doesn't like her. Well I found out she was talking to this guy, and telling him how they should have made things work, and she regrets being with me and all this bs shit talking about me and how I am the worse person...mind you, I was willing to get engaged at this point, But after I saw and read that, I no longer feel right taking that step. I don't trust this woman at all. I told her and her family what I know and where I stand. She got very ugly and threatened me about lawyers and taking my custody away, or moving out of state so I would not see my child. I made it clear, that my priority after what I found out was my education, my child and my family. If this relationship is meant to be, it will work out itself and I am done forcing myself. I think I did the most adult thing, I accepted my child, and refused to be in this ""relationship"" where after 4.5 years with you, she talks shit behind my back and regrets being with me. She made the decision to keep our child, its her body and I respected that, and I will be there for my child 100%. She threatened me how I will not get to name our child or even be there, and how I won't be able to sign the birth certificate. I understand its all hot air, and I am just gonna let this clear out. I am done torturing myself. I got a plan and I am going to stick to it. I think its also a good idea for me to post to legal, to understand my rights as a father. Thanks again!

3qj0q7,5,2015-10-28,USGS Cooperative Summer Geosciences Internship Program,Bananaman1229,geologycareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/geologycareers/comments/3qj0q7/usgs_cooperative_summer_geosciences_internship/,"Hello geologycareers!  I am writing to y'all to see if anyone here has ever had any experience with the internship program I named in the title.  First, a little bit of background on myself and the internship program...

A month after completing my university's field camp last summer, I received an email from the professor that lead field camp stating that he was nominating me for an internship opportunity with the USGS.   Instead of trying to describe the internship with my own words, I'll just copy and paste the attachment from the USGS included in the email.

""I am pleased to announce that the U.S. Geological Survey is celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Cooperative Summer Geosciences Internship Program with the National Association of Geoscience Teachers in 2015. The USGS will hire approximately 50 of this year’s outstanding field camp students. Established in 1965, this is the Nation’s longest, continuously running earth science internship program. From its inception, over 2,400 students have participated in this program, with many participants proceeding on to distinguished careers with the USGS, academia, or industry. This internship provides an exceptional professional opportunity for your outstanding field camp graduates. To be selected for this program, students must first be nominated by their field camp director. Therefore, I invite you to nominate a limited number of your outstanding field camp graduates for the upcoming summer internship opportunities. We ask for these nominations now, because many students make summer plans early in the academic year and time is needed to match students with USGS internship research opportunities.

Academic excellence, superb performance in field-based studies, and a strong work ethic are the criteria for selection. Please give these criteria careful consideration when making your nominations. The number of students you may nominate is based upon your camp’s enrollment:
•         Nominate your top student if the camp enrollment is 20 students or less
•         Nominate up to 2 if the camp enrollment is 40 students or less
•         Nominate up to 3 from camps with greater than 40 students
•         Nominate up to 4 from camps with greater than 60 students
Also, a student may only be nominated if:
•         His/her field course was at least 4 weeks in duration and was completed in 2015
•         He/she is a U.S. citizen (as interns will be federal employees)



Along with your nomination, please briefly summarize your reasons for nominating each student selected. This may be as simple as listing the special attributes that you found in a particular student or the qualities that the student(s) demonstrated during field camp that made them stand out. Providing this information will greatly help the USGS Placement Panel to understand your reasons for the nomination, and also improve the panel’s ability to place that student with the project best suited to their capabilities.


Because this program is highly competitive, before you nominate someone, please contact the student to make certain that he/she is able and available to work with the USGS.  Please tell them that they will be hired at the GS-5 level, and, in most instances, they will be responsible for their own daily living and housing expenses. Once a student has been identified for consideration, please send me his/her name, address, phone number, and email.  Please send these nominations to me by October 16, 2015.

Once I have received everyone’s nominations, I will forward them to the USGS. Then I, as the NAGT representative, and Robert Ridky, as the USGS representative, will both send all nominees a letter of congratulations. The USGS will also provide additional information that will guide the student through the application process. So please send me the names, addresses, and email addresses of your nominees.""


So this brings me to my questions for the geologycareers community:
Has anyone here participated in this internship opportunity? If someone has, I would greatly appreciate any insight or advice on the application process, along with any experiences one had on the job that they would be willing to share.
Has anyone here also been nominated for this internship, and if so, has anyone heard anything from the USGS yet about the application process?

3qj60p,1,2015-10-28,NY C&amp;F question: How fucked am I?,characterNfailness,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/3qj60p/ny_cf_question_how_fucked_am_i/,"I'm a 3L at a T14 planning to seek admission to the New York bar next year. I'm set to graduate at the top of my class, and I have a great biglaw gig lined up for next year.

Before I entered law school, I spent several years on a different educational track—an expensive one. I'd rather not give any specifics about my background that would identify me, but the program was something along the lines of medical or dental school. I finished the degree, but I just hated the field so much that I decided to go to law school rather than practicing in the field I'd been training for. 

Throughout college and graduate school, I received partial scholarships but had to take out student loans for a large amount of tuition and living expenses. By the time I graduate from law school next year, I'll owe about $450,000 in principal and accrued interest. I have been continually enrolled as a full-time student and have not earned any meaningful amount of income since I graduated from high school almost ten years ago. All of my loans have remained in deferment during this time and, for the most part (see below), I've made no payments toward them.

I'm not worried about paying those loans back. It will be unpleasant, and my spouse and I will have to continue living frugally for a long time, but fortunately I expect to be able to throw almost all of my $170k salary (less taxes) at the loans.

But I recently read about [this guy](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/02/business/02lawyer.html)—a would-be lawyer who was denied admission to the New York bar due to his massive student loan debt. He owed $430,000—that's less than what I'll owe when I'm considered for admission next year. Some accounts of his story claim that his denial was based on the fact that he hadn't made a good-faith effort to repay the loans over many years, but others say that the court was simply astonished by the amount of his loans and viewed it as proof of his financial irresponsibility.

I think a lot of my debt would be seen to a C&amp;F examiner as unnecessary and extravagant. My spouse and I have never gone on fancy vacations, and we don't really have anything nice. My most valuable physical possessions are my iPhone and my laptop. We don't have a car or nice clothes. But we have a comfortable apartment and we buy what we need without worrying about it too much. I also get takeout pretty regularly because I'm too busy to prepare food. There are a lot of things I could have done over the years to be more frugal; I failed to do them and now I'm afraid I'll be foreclosed from my profession as a result.

So how fucked am I? It never even occurred to me that simply having a lot of outstanding loans might prevent me from being able to practice law. At this point, I've sunk a huge amount of money into my J.D. and I've shifted my career toward law (and away from my previous field) over the last three years. If I can't practice law, how am I supposed to repay my loans? A bigger problem, in my view, is that I have no way of knowing for sure whether I'll be denied admission until it's too late. By the time that decision will be rendered, I'll have taken the New York bar exam (and forgone the opportunity to take another state's exam), incurred the cost of settling down in NYC, and lost the opportunity to establish a career at a firm (and a life) in another state. I have my previous degree to fall back on if I'm not able to practice law, but the reality is that I haven't kept up with the field in the time since I completed the degree; there are new candidates coming out of school every day who are fresher and have taken the right steps to make themselves marketable, and I won't be competitive enough against them to land a job that would allow me to make the kind of money right off the bat that I'd make in biglaw (and that I *need to make* in order to manage my debt). I *want* to be a lawyer.

What can I do? I've been trying to make small payments on my outstanding loans to demonstrate an intent to repay them, but I just don't have the money to pay more than a few hundred dollars a month toward them. That's the reason I took out loans in the first place—I'm a full-time student on the executive board of the flagship journal working two unpaid internships, and I don't have any money.

3qkf6z,3,2015-10-28,"Deepdown, I know I'm right, but I need to hear your opinions",Damnpirate,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3qkf6z/deepdown_i_know_im_right_but_i_need_to_hear_your/,"Hi guys,

I'm going to try to keep it short, since I dont want to bother you with too many details. So here it goes.

I was with my ex for 18 months. We had been in a long distance relationship (Australia-France kind of distance) for 6 of these month.

Anyway, I was in love with this girl, first serious relationship ever for me, 4th or so for her. But she always told me it was the best relationship she ever had, and nothing compared to it. I was happy with everything, we had our fights, but in the end, we worked them out and made it work, even with the distance.

She was going to do a 6 month internship in Australia (it was me in Australia before), and we were ready for that. We were ready to overcome it, and at the end of it, maybe try to finally move in together for a while and see how it would go.

So basically, she leaves for Australia... And 3 weeks later, dumps me over skype, out of the blue. Her reasons were that she was not in love with me the same way she was at the beginning. I was also not manly enough, not confident enough, and not macho enough for her (can't even grasp this one..). She told me she had slowly drifted away from me the past 6 month or so, without me noticing, and without her telling me about it once.

Anyway, I try to tell her that we can fix this, but she doesnt want to, and I'm devastated. It sort of happened without me noticing anything, so as you can imagine, I felt really bad for weeks.

But anyway, I read a lot about these sort of breakups here on reddit and on the internet, talked to my friends, and went no contact from there. Had my up and downs, but I was finally able to have some good days. Things were getting better.

But 2 month after the breakup happened, she called me, and as a dumbass, I answered. She wanted to know how I was doing and so on. I answered shortly, kept distance with her. As the conversation went on, she told me that she was sad about how things ended between us, and that she didnt have real friends there and felt a bit depressed. I said I couldnt really help her. I asked her if she had any regrets, and she would answer. She told me (as she started crying) that she didnt tell me the whole truth. And there she said it. She cheated on me, a week before leaving for Australia, with her ex boyfriend. She tried to justify it by saying he had all I didnt have. Being manly, confident, macho, and on top of that, he didnt care about her, which turned her on to flirt with him that night.

They slept together. It was at a week-end with her friends, and I wasnt there btw.

Anyway, so she stayed with me for 1 month after cheating on me, not telling me straight after it, not telling me when she broke up with me.

After the call ended, I felt like shit. She tried to apologize by text messages. Trying to justify, to apologize, but never saying anything about getting back together.

I answered only once, and told her how I felt knowing that, saying how disappointed I was, how I didnt know If I could forget nor forgive that.

I told her I didnt need to hear anything more, cause there was no point. And I blocked her from FB right after she answered to that, apologizing profusely again.

And then, 2 weeks after that call, she emails me, and tells me that she wanted to apologize again, and that she wanted to tell me things in case we wouldnt talk again. She complimented on how a great guy I was, how awesome and such, how she didnt deserve me, and how lucky the next girl would be to have me. How she was sorry that she ruined everything. How she was sorry to hurt me, and that my pain must be so much bigger than her guilt. She added that she wanted to talk to me again when I was ready, and that she knew that I needed time since I blocked her from FB. She said that she didnt want for things to stay like that for ever.

I only answered "" I read your email. I need time and space, without news from you. I know you can understand and respect that."" To which she replied that ""Ok, if ever I wanted to talk to her again, I knew where to find her"".

So here's my questions. What are your opinions on my story ? Did I make the right decisions up to now ? Is there anything I should/could do to feel better ?

I really felt like she was special and wouldnt do that to me, but seeing that she could makes me a bit bitter now. I feel like I shouldnt give my trust anymore, cause it caused me great pain.

Anyway, I know I promised to keep it short, so sorry about that ! Thanks if you read through that wall of text. If you didnt, I dont blame you ! I needed to write that I think. Feels good.

Deepdown, I know that I made the right choice. But these past few days, I've been kinda wanting to get back in contact with her, and let her know how much it hurts and I'd like to know how much she regrets it. I don't think it's healthy, but that's what I want to do lately. Haven't convinced myself to break no contact yet, so I'd like to hear from you.
Would like some external opinions on that matter.

Cheers, and thanks to reddit's community in general, it has already helped me a ton !

3qkox1,42,2015-10-28,Another example showing AWALT,grimreaperx2,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/3qkox1/another_example_showing_awalt/,"This is my first time posting here, however I have been a participator in this sub for quite some time.

I was scrolling down the front page and found this in the revenge sub. Who doesn't like a good revenge story? Anyway to get some background on the story you can [read the story here.](https://archive.is/QaIzP)

So let's dissect this from the redpill perspective:

&gt;When I first started med school, I had a girlfriend who was decently attractive. Not 10/10 but definitely a solid 7/10. Unfortunately, she thought of herself as a 10/10 and acted like one too. As med school wore on, I started spending more time studying and less time caring for myself. As she was a ""10/10"" and thus had no business doing anything beneath her, I was the only person who was doing the cleaning, cooking, and paying for the apartment we shared. This took up even more of my time as I entered my internship. Sometimes I'd come back to a dirty apartment that I'd have to clean up after a long shift, and I only had less time to take care of myself as a result so my appearance suffered; I got fatter and some days I'd have to rush out the door without shaving because I'd only gotten two hours of sleep after cleaning and cooking. She'd never help and she was verbally (and sometimes physically) abusive. I stayed with her because I was deeply in love with her.

So right off OP's girlfriend has an over inflated ego. She is shacked up with a med student because we all know when OP graduates he will be bringing in bank. Also she displays the entitled mentality and thinks just existing the relationship is more than enough contribution in this relationship. Now OP is having to pick her slack and responsibilities as his own on top of his already highly demanding major. OP let's himself go, starts to lose his value, and has a case of oneitis.

&gt;About half a year into my internship I found out my girlfriend was cheating on me with some art student she said ""was there for her"" and ""made her feel special and needed."" I told her to get out of my apartment, and she was all too happy to do so.

Op is an asshole, can't he see that he is not being attentive enough to his princess? OP's girlfriend hamsters away a reason to justify her lack of loyalty and cheats on OP. She happily leaves because she has another guy already that will take her in. Then again had she ever actually invested anything in the relationship maybe it would have been worth more to her. Instead she gets up and leaves with no regards for OP's effort and hard word in the relationship. In the end she just got up and left with a smile. She lived on OP's expense, contributed nothing, and left without any liability. Used and abused.

&gt;Fast forward a few years and she's in a Master's program in Europe an starts talking to me again. I'm on the cusp of finishing my residency and about to start earning the ""big bucks"" people think doctors earn. She asks me for another chance; I was tempted to go for it until she started verbally abusing me again over our Facetime/Skype sessions. I hatched a plot: I told her she'd have to quit her Master's program and come to the states within three months (she was graduating in six). She was reticent to do so, but I told her that if she wanted me back she needed to give me a show of good faith. I guess she figured she'd hamstring me by trapping me with marriage because she agreed.

OP isn't too stupid. He is in the residency phase of his medical career and guess who comes back knocking at OP's door. His beloved princess who before was heartbroken by OP's lack of attention and physical presence is back because OP is about to start see some returns on his hard work. But it doesn't take long for her to fall back to her old ways. OP's old girlfriend clearly went around on the CC and even decided to check out the CC in Europe while OP was hard at work building his career making something of himself. Now she wants back in with OP because those guys don't want anything to do with her and of course she deserves a share of OP's wealth because she was there for a part of his med school.

&gt;The day before she was due to fly out to the U.S. I told her I was lying. I blocked her on all my accounts and never spoke to her again. From what I understand she's now surfing couches getting by on begging for charity from what few friends she made in Europe, and sometimes fucking some dude twice her age so he'd throw money at her.

In the end OP sees what she is truly after, protects his rear, and get's revenge.

Anyway this is my analysis of this story.

TL;DR: OP's girlfriend: AWALT.

Edit: Corrected some words, added a bit more insight."

After the dust settled I started my medical internships. 

Right now I'm doing 12 weeks of internal medicine and this week I can do nightshifts.
It's not mandatory.

It could be a nice experience if it weren't for the doctor who is ""teaching"" me for last week and this one.

He's a narc:


* Talking about himself the whole time;

* ""Explaining"" everything to me unasked; 
* Inventing new things so he has something to lecture me about; 
* Promising to let me interact with the patients but then sending me away to write his reports;
* Getting passive aggressive when I stop playing along;
* Disappearing in demanding situations (leadership skills needed) only to return and criticize the improvisation I did in his absence;

I was able to handle it for a while but this morning he got to me and I got sad.

Defeated I decided to just leave and went to pick up my things in the residentroom.

There sitting at a computer I met an oncology resident. She mostly comes in early because her schedule is always full. Sometimes I hear her complaining about the workload she has to deal with.  But beyond her complains she really loves what she is doing.

Anyway she saw my mood and asked me about the night. I told her how I did the annoying things and how our colleague did the fun parts.

I told her ""that I was leaving early because I felt unwell"" and she just gave me a thumbs up.

Right there and then I decided that I was not going to let him do that to me any longer and called in sick for the remaining two shifts I would have with him.

Thereafter I felt really confident and happy for protecting myself the sneaky way without giving him any ammunition to punish me with.

I'm looking for some advice for my husband's situation as I think we've finally reached an impasse.

My husband is a man of many careers. He initially studied psychology in undergrad and got his BA there. He later got an associates in Computer Science, but didn't pursue further due to a tech bubble bursting around the time he graduated.

He has an M.Sc in Neuroscience. He worked in that field for four years before realizing he wouldn't go far beyond personal support and neuro-rehab without better qualifications.

He scrapped neurosci at the age of 28 when he moved back in with his parents to get his B. Eng in Mechanical Engineering (this is when we met). I left Europe to come home to Canada and work on my career in 2008 because his country was hit particularly hard by the financial crash.

He finished his B. Eng in 2010 at the age of 31. He moved to Canada and started working as a CAD designer here. He hated it and made less than interns at my company for the privilege (I work in learning and development in the tech industry). He became depressed during this time.

After about a year he wasn't going anywhere and hated his job. They kept shuffling career advancement and a salary raise a perpetual ""6 months down the road"" so he was reluctant to quit and move on to something that would be more lucrative and better for his career. I had a pretty steady progression in terms of career and salary during that time because I mostly work contracts and move around a lot.

I begged him to quit and find something that would be better for his career, open an RRSP (Canadian IRA) and think about the future. He said he didn't want to get outside his comfort zone and didn't care about the future. We had many fights about him taking more financial responsibility, but nothing budged him. I tried to explain that not all engineering jobs involve sitting behind a desk all day but he never even sent out applications or looked into it.

Finally, he said that he wanted to put the corporate world behind him and move to a farm and start a cider company, which is what I want as well. He quit his job and interned on a farm for 6 months during which I supported us both. When he returned, his depression did as well and he was unable to find a job in engineering, neurorehab or computer science. He worked as a waiter part-time for another 6 months.

By this time, I was growing a little tired of taking everything on myself and spinning our wheels. We went to counselling and he finally started treating his depression. I would have liked to use this time to learn more about the alcohol business and how to sell to bars, but I had to be the one with the steady job so I never got that opportunity.

We finally moved out of a city to a small town. I was able to work remotely, which is what I would like to do when we have a farm and my salary supports us as long as I have steady work. He is now a labourer for a contractor which he really likes but is making 10K less than he did as an engineer which wasn't much (~40K CAD).

I am really worried that this will affect us being able to get a mortgage. He has 90K in savings that his parents gave him, but we have been unable to save for the future because he hasn't stuck with anything long enough to get past entry-level.

He needs a better job so we can save more but people throw his resume right in the trash and he ""hates working in an office""

Are we fucked? What can be done? He is 36 now and I'm 30. I feel like I gave all my advice years ago when I was telling him to focus on his career for the future because we are in that future now. I genuinely don't know how to help him solve this problem. Any advice for this situation?

Thanks in advance.

Tl:dr husband changes career ever 3-4 years, never enough to be stable, now we are trying to start a farm business but can't get to a place where we can both contribute. How can we get to that place, if possible?"
3qmcir,4,2015-10-28,Business,Rob_G,Rob_G,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rob_G/comments/3qmcir/business/,"Oscar said, “But I just had my performance review last week, and you didn’t mention anything about downsizing.”

“So I’ll say … I’ll say something like,” Janet paused, “I’ll say, you know … no, I’ll say, you knew. When you came aboard, you knew about the volatility inherent in the market. That’s just … it’s unfortunate.” She paused again. She thought about running her fingers alongside her temple to make sure that her brown hair was still matted down behind her ears, but she had already repeated that gesture around Oscar twice in the last twenty minutes, and she couldn’t be sure whether or not he’d taken a mental note, or even made an unconscious connection, and besides, her hair was fine then, even though it wasn’t about the hair, even though it was kind of about the hair, about the haircut, about how she got it cut two weeks ago, about how she didn’t anticipate the maintenance involved, about the constant rubbing of her hands along her temple, down behind her ears. “I’ll say it’s just business.”

Oscar said, “Don’t say it’s just business. Where are we going anyway?”

Janet looked at her watch. It was eleven fifty-seven. “If we get to Flagrock in the next three minutes, we might not have to wait for a table.”

“Flagrock? Wait, which place is that again? Is that the one with the sunchokes?” Oscar made a face.

Janet entertained his not so subtle reservations, but she was deliberately walking on Oscar’s outside, and so when she made that decisive left onto Fifty-Seventh, Oscar didn’t have the physical space to register Janet’s command of where they were headed.

Oscar didn’t mention anything about how they were now headed west. A small victory, absolutely, and Janet couldn’t be sure of whether or not she’d allow herself to take more pride in the possibility that Oscar had voiced an opinion about her choice in restaurant and how she didn’t need to say anything to deny him a chance at dissent, or that Oscar didn’t even make an outward attempt to change her mind, that maybe he wasn’t even aware that he was following her plan, and her route, to the restaurant that she wanted to go to, the one with the sunchokes. Although before she could remember that it was sure to hit, there was that sting, a minor resentment at all of the planning, the positioning on the sidewalk, and if she had been walking on Oscar’s left side, and he had continued straight on Third while she wanted to make that left, would she have risked him not following her turn? Would she have had to double back? No, get out of your head Janet. Watch your left hand Janet, you’re on your temple again, and your hair is still fine, it’s all in place.

Oscar said, “How about this: My numbers have been fine this quarter. My numbers this quarter have been better than the projections that we talked about, and that’s hovering in optimistic territory if I remember correctly. And no, I don’t just remember. I have all the numbers from last quarter. What if I bring all the numbers with me? What if I’m shoving those numbers in your face, all of the assets, all of the quality paper? What are you going to say then?”

Janet wanted to take her handbag out of her right hand with her left hand. She wanted her right hand free so she could to bring it to her face, she wanted to curl her index finger and anchor it along her upper lip by pressing it in as hard as she could, she wanted to move her thumb inside of her barely parted lips while at the same time locking her jaw so that her teeth were open maybe a quarter of an inch. She wanted to do this thing that she always did where, after anchoring her index finger, hard on her face, after locking her jaw, also hard, she’d let her thumb move around freely inside. There’d be no risk of ruining her acrylic neutral-colored manicure because there’d be no chance to nail bite or cuticle bite, there’d be no chance to because everything would be fixed, everything steady against her perfect acrylic neutral-colored thumbnail. She did this thing where she ever so gently grazed the sides of her thumbnail against that small space in between the fourth incisors on the top and bottom of the right side of her mouth. It made this clicking sound, more like a cross between a clicking and a tapping, a sound she was more than positive had to have been audible only to her, small, very tiny sound waves that only existed in that space in between her inner ear and the cavity of her mouth. She could make it click and tap over and over again, sitting at her desk, sometime half an hour, an hour, and when she had to take a call or use her hand for something else, there was never any damage to the nail acrylic, never. Sometimes she thought about what she’d look like as a skeleton hundreds of years after she’d die, about how there’d be a slight indent on those fourth incisors on the top and the bottom, all of that tapping and clicking, which would be crazy, or not crazy, but it would be a testament to her expertly manicured nails, that there was never so much as a dint on the corners of her thumbnail, nothing. But she couldn’t do tap or click in public. And so she had to have her bag in her right hand, even though she was right-handed, although have is a strong word. But maybe it was a strong gesture. Maybe there was a strong possibility of her automatically clicking and tapping her nail, while she was out, while she thought about how to answer Oscar, and even if she wouldn’t do that, there was definitely a stronger possibility of her thinking about doing it, a fear then, no, fear is too strong, more like a worry. She’d worry about doing it. And there were better ways for her to spend her mental energy than worrying. Worrying about her thumbnail, about the possibility of not ruining her thumbnail manicure in public.

“I’ll say it without hesitation,” Janet said it decisively, “I’ll say it decisively. I’ll nod along and, if I have to, I’ll let him show me his numbers.”

Oscar interrupted, “No, answer me. Don’t tell me how you’ll answer me. I’m Jim, and I’m showing you my numbers. I don’t deserve this. I’ve proven myself again and again, I’ve put in more than my share of hours, and there are other people who deserve the axe instead of me, and I can name them, I can say what about Paul? What are Paul’s numbers like? I know what Paul’s numbers are like. And I know what Morris’s numbers are like too. So why are you getting rid of me and not Paul and not Morris?”

“Listen,” Janet was still decisive, “the thing about this is, and I think you know this Jim, but even though we’re living quarter-to-quarter, it’s not just about the quarter. The integrity of the firm, the foundation upon which we’re striving to grow, and not just this year, and not just until the next meltdown, but it’s got to be a tight machine, and I’m sorry if you’re taking this personally, and I’m sorry if you think this isn’t fair,” she said that last part with just the right hint of venom, she didn’t plan for it, and it sent an undercurrent of charge through her now very convincing answer, “but this is business.” She thought about repeating the last line, just to dare Oscar to tell her not to say it’s business again, but she backed off, that charge still present, now it felt like it was floating in the corners of her jaw.

Oscar said, “Boom. That’s terrific. OK, well what about this, what if he says something like … what if he says something like I can’t have this right now, I can’t, I have a wife and kids.” Oscar started to smirk a little.

“Fuck off,” Janet said it exactly the way she had to say it. The restaurant was just ahead, just at the end of this block. She checked her watch again. A minute past twelve.

Oscar said, “Wait, which place is this again?”

“Flagrock,” Janet said. She didn’t want a debate.

Oscar said, “I’m just … what kind of a restaurant is this?”

“You said it before, the place with the sunchokes.”

“I’m just … can we look at the menu first?”

“There’s no time. This place is going to be packed in about three minutes.”

Oscar said, “Fine,” but then a second later, he said, “but I just …”

“But you just what? What do you want out of this? It’s lunch. It’s a business lunch.”

“I know, I just … what kind of a restaurant is this? I really don’t remember. I mean, I kind of remember, but I don’t remember that much. I just want to see the menu. I just want to have an idea of what kind of a place this is. What does it look like?”

“Fuck you,” she didn’t say it right that time, but the time for saying fuck you and transitioning to a winking smile had passed, and it would have been awkward to try to smooth it out, to turn it into something it clearly wasn’t. Oscar got quiet. “It’s just,” Janet said, “it’s just another one of these lunch places, come on, they’re all the same.”

They walked into the front door. The restaurant itself was in the basement of a large midtown skyscraper, and the entrance was a dedicated restaurant side door that opened to a communal lobby accessed by a series of revolving doors at a forty-five degree angle to the dedicated restaurant door. They walked toward the granite steps that led to the wide-open floor plan of the restaurant. “I’m sorry,” Janet allowed herself the indulgence, “I didn’t mean it like that. I’m just … I’m just all pumped up now. You know how it is. I’m just ready.”

Oscar said, “No. Please, Janet. Do not apologize. You tell me what you need here. This place is fine. You asked me here, I’m here to do this, I’m here so that you’re ready to do this, don’t … we’re good.” The way he said it though, he was definitely deflated somehow, like he just got punched in the gut but was doing his best to tough it out.

They walked down the granite stairs. The restaurant opened up before them. Because it was in the basement, because of the way the place was lit, it looked like there weren’t any defined boundaries. It was like this place, aside from the stairs that they’d just walked down, wasn’t fixed in time or space. There were tables, a bar, there were lots of people everywhere, but the edges just faded to black in the periphery. There was a podium at the bottom of the stairs, and behind the podium there was a young woman wearing a business suit, wearing bright red lipstick, her hair pulled back in a bun so tight that it shot an outward current of forced physical empathy at Janet.

Janet looked at that bun, she knew how a bun like that felt, she knew what a bun like that felt like at noon, and then later in the day, at four or at five. When you get home at the end of a long day with a bun like that still pulling your hair upward, your forehead straight up and out and back, when you walk in the door, there’s nothing like taking that bun out, the mix of pure relief and pain, almost in equal proportions. You’ve spent all day, it pulling your hair, and pull is only a correct description if you imagine it in the most dramatic sense of the word. Your hair is pulled to a direction completely opposite of where it wants to go, and although it never gets comfortable being pulled straight back, it does get used to it, some of the resistance wears off, that by the time you take the bun out at the end of the day, sure, your hair wants to be free, but at some level it doesn’t remember how.

Janet didn’t want to, but the hostess’s bun forced her to think about her second job out of college, at least twenty years ago now, her second real job out of college, twenty-two, twenty-thee years ago? She’d just been promoted to trader, but she hadn’t yet started her CFA exams. After a year on the job, it had been clear that her advancement opportunities wouldn’t be as forthcoming as the firm managers had made it appear during her secondary interviews, so she found another job with a smaller firm, one that assured her a more direct path toward growth and opportunity. She took it. She gave her then-bosses a two-week’s notice, which they accepted. But the next day, Janet came into work not with her hair pulled back in a bun, but down, not all the way down, but in a ponytail. On her second day into her two-week’s notice, HR told her she wouldn’t have to finish up the two weeks.

Janet shouldered her way through the growing crowd of businesspeople and stood directly in front of the hostess’s podium. The hostess looked up and smiled, warmly. There was nothing at all outwardly fake about the warmth, but the fact that Janet knew a smile like that wasn’t optional took away from whatever attempt it tried to pass at sincerity.

“Good afternoon,” the hostess said, even warmer.

“Hi,” Janet said. “Two, please.”

The hostess looked down at what had to have been a screen that was either positioned or built-in to the podium in such a way that obscured all traces of its existence.

“Terrific,” the hostess said. “May I have your name?”

Janet looked at the infinite expanse of restaurant floor just behind the hostess and her podium. There were these huge potted plants, which, every time Janet came here for lunch, she wondered how they managed their photosynthesis in an area so devoid of light. Half the tables were empty, and Janet thought about pressing her case for an immediate seat. She looked at her watch, it was six past twelve. Fuck. And all of these people waiting around … maybe they should go somewhere else … no, they were definitively behind the rest of the lunch crowd … fuck, they should have gotten there earlier.

“Janet,” Janet smiled too, and while she couldn’t tell what her smile looked like, it didn’t feel warm. Maybe when the hostess smiled, she didn’t feel her own projected warmth either. But when Janet smiled, the hostess, still smiling, cooled off somewhat, and Janet’s smile felt tighter somehow, like it was twisted, and it got worse as she tried to relax her facial muscles a little.

“Great, Janet, thank you,” the hostess said, doing whatever she was doing with whatever might have been under that podium. “We’ll let you know when we’re ready.”

“Thanks,” Janet turned away. Then she turned back. “Do you have any idea as to how long …” she trailed off. She tried to relax her smile a little more.

“It won’t be too much longer,” the hostess said as someone else elbowed Janet out of the way. Janet thought, just how long? Ten minutes? Fifteen? She thought about all of those empty tables. An unwelcome voice in her head screamed out, bitch, but Janet countered with a louder voice, it’s not her fault, it’s fine. She turned back toward Oscar, almost lost in the crowd, which seemed to have doubled in volume since she was at the podium. She could hear the hostess say good afternoon, her warmth receding as if Janet were walking away from a smoldering fire.

Oscar didn’t ask how long, he just half nodded, half smiled. Janet thought about her hair one more time, she moved her head quickly to the left, as if she’d seen someone to her side, and then just as abruptly back. The motion was deliberate, it gave any stray locks an opportunity to fall sideways against her forehead. But she didn’t feel anything, and so the urge to smooth out her temple subsided somewhat.

While they waited, it was impossible to talk in this crowd, not impossible, but they couldn’t talk business. They could, but, well, you never know who’s out to lunch. Janet thought again about her haircut, which was by this point even more of an unwelcome mental intrusion. But Janet let the thoughts play out, the idea being that maybe they’d exhaust themselves and she wouldn’t have to think about her hair while eating lunch.

Her hair had been longer, not much longer, but long enough that there was no risk of any hair falling in her face. When she chose this hairstyle, the stray hair being so far the only downside, it hadn’t been a factor, not something she could have anticipated. All she thought about was how she’d be able to slick her hair back at the sides, how, on top, her hair would go up and then back and then down, meeting with the hair from her sides, all of it joining forces before coming to a crisp stop just below the hairline at the back of her neck.

And then, at home, right out of the shower, before she put her product in that kept everything so neat, her hair fell forward, bracketing the sides of her face, the front-most strands fell to about as low as her chin, everything else getting progressively shorter as it moved up the jawline. It was like two haircuts, really, like she could be two different people. Although she regretted not asking in more detail about the daily maintenance, about whether or not the hair would want to fall out from behind her ears.

Oscar said, “I have a call at one.”

“No, I have a call at one too,” Janet reassured him.

“Janet?” another hostess with an identical suit and hairstyle as the first hostess had snuck up beside Janet and Oscar. “Right this way,” she didn’t wait for a response. “Watch your step,” she motioned downward just ahead with an outstretched hand to point out two obvious stairs that officially separated the waiting area from the restaurant floor. “Your server will be right with you,” she beamed as she used the same outstretched palm to present the table she’d brought them to. It was a booth. The seats had deep, red leather cushions. The tabletop was pure, some sort of stained or laminated wood.

Oscar said, “I can’t see anything in here,” he squinted and looked around, “I have no idea what this place even looks like.”

Janet took in her surroundings, the infinite expanse from before had contracted now that they were sitting down, so that the blackness that defied physical boundaries when they were standing up had now closed in around their table. She could see the table, she could see the salt shaker and the black wooden pepper grinder, the shiny metal bowl that Janet knew housed the sugar and various artificial as well as raw and unprocessed selection of sweeteners.

But outside of their table, there was void. When the waiter appeared, he materialized from the blackness. He asked if they’d like to start out with something to drink. Janet said that they were ready to give him everything, even though she knew that Oscar hadn’t yet had a chance to look at the menu. She ordered the sunchokes as an appetizer, to which the waiter regretfully informed Janet that, unfortunately the sunchokes weren’t available today. Janet could have sworn she saw two men eating sunchokes on their way over to the table, and she voiced her doubts. The waiter smiled and said something about the restaurant taking pride in only the best ingredients, about how their sunchokes are sourced from a very specific farm along the California coast, about how when they’re not available, the restaurant would rather go without than to substitute with an inferior product. But Janet shook her head, she stood up halfway and pointed out two men three tables back, she said, those two men, they’re eating the sunchokes, I’ve had them here a thousand times. The waiter paused, he said something suggestive of an apology, he took the rest of their order, an unsweetened iced tea for Janet and a Diet Coke for Oscar. Janet ordered a rueben sandwich. Oscar ordered some sort of salad, to which Janet playfully said, you pussy, which she regretted as soon as she said it, because it immediately fell almost dead flat as a joke, even though Oscar played along, he made an over-the-top smile, and then a gagging face as he patted his belly in a dramatic gesture. The waiter said nothing and walked away. Janet followed him through the void, which was impossible, but she thought she saw him at a computer terminal at the opposite side of the restaurant floor, she thought she saw him talking to another waiter, and they both looked in Janet’s direction, and the waiter said something, Janet could almost see his mouth, he was mouthing, that fucking bitch.

The sunchokes were terrible, dry, overseasoned. She wondered if the men she’d seen ordering the sunchokes had similarly been told of their unavailability, if they’d, just like her shook their heads no and demanded sunchokes, if the restaurant, unable to not comply with the requests of the guests decided it would be easier to serve dry and overseasoned sunchokes rather than stand by some corporate policy regarding the integrity of their exclusively sourced dishes. She’d had the sunchokes here a thousand times, these sunchokes are not up to par, and she said that again to the waiter, who didn’t listen to Janet’s full complaint, he interrupted and said he’d be happy to take it off the bill, and he did, he took it off the bill and placed the bill directly in front of Oscar, who just kind of sat there like an idiot. Janet was the higher ranked, so she put her card on top of the check in front of Oscar. She wanted the waiter to see her name when he ran it through the machine, she wanted him realize his mistake and offer some sort of an apology, or at least an acknowledgement, here’s your card ma’am. But he ran the card and placed the whole card and pen and printed-out receipts right back in front of Oscar, and so Janet had to reach across the table while Oscar pretended to look at his Blackberry and Janet had to leave a twenty-percent tip because HR had sent an email a while back mandating twenty percent tips on corporate cards because apparently some jerkoff waiters had taken to posting to the Internet on their bullshit blogs photographic evidence about how certain fat-cat bankers at specific medium-sized and larger-sized firms often left less than twenty-percent, sometimes less than fifteen, and so just leave twenty the email said, twenty-percent to the penny. And then they got up and Janet’s stomach twisted into a knot because the sandwich she just ate was very heavy, and even though she hadn’t touched her fries, she could feel the Swiss cheese starting to coagulate inside of her, mixing with the congealed fat from the corned beef. She took a handful of tropical flavored antacids which didn’t seem to have any effect on her at all, aside from leaving a thick, chalky residue that coated the inside of her mouth, a texture she’d be aware of for the next half an hour, at least.

Jim walked into Janet’s office. He was holding three folders filled with files.

“Hi, Jim,” Janet stood up from behind her desk and motioned toward a chair on the other side. “Please, sit down.”

Jim gave a half-smile and pulled out the chair that Janet had indicated. He sat down and stared at Janet across from her broad desk. There was a framed picture of her mother on one side, and on the other another framed picture, this one of a cat. She didn’t have a cat, but one time she overheard some summer interns talking about a certain senior vice-president, a woman who sacrificed everything for the job, a woman with no family, no husband, not even any pets. They said it just like that: no family, no husband, no pets, like they were diagnosing a terminal patient.

“Look, Jim,” Janet started out. She needed to pick up some momentum. Once she had momentum, she’d be fine, she’d have that charge, that current, whatever it was. But right now, she didn’t have it yet. She thought about whether or not she could have passed this off to Oscar. But seeing as how it was passed off to her, it probably wouldn’t have been appropriate.

Jim said, “If this is about the …”

“I’m just going to get right to it,” Janet said. She felt a sphere of static energy sparking to life. It was a small spark, just recently born but growing rapidly and accumulating energy. It was located right below her throat, right where she imagined her thyroid gland was, housed in a little protective sack right behind her voice box.

“As a firm, we’re dedicated not just toward the bottom line, toward which your work has been phenomenal, nothing short of invaluable Jim.” The words poured out of her, “Your contributions since 2008 cannot be overstated. And I know that, personally speaking, your steadfast vision toward the principles that ground this firm, that make this firm stand out amongst a crowded pack of worthy competition, have lent us a credibility that I’m positive will make you an asset at any number of …”

Jim interrupted, “You’ve got to be fucking kidding me.”

“Jim, I understand why you’d see this as not in line with the firm’s philosophy, but you have to remember that, going forward, we’re operating in a changed environment, the landscape isn’t necessarily defined solely by performance. The firm needs to make sure we’re leaner than before 2008, that when the next storm hits, that we’ll be able to withstand the turmoil that …”

Jim interrupted, “And what about Robert? He couldn’t say this to my face? This is fucking beautiful, just fucking classic.” Jim lifted his arms and let his three overstuffed folders drop on Janet’s desk.

“Robert is irrelevant here, Jim. Robert, Seth, Peters, the entire board is in consensus here. Jim, I’m confident you’re going to find something immediately, something soon, something commensurate with everything you’ve done here with us. Jim, I’ve been there. I know it’s tough. But you have to think about this as an opportunity. And it’s not just you. And it’s not personal. It’s just business.” Janet felt the electricity disperse, like a balloon had been popped in her throat and now her head was charged, and the charge was coming out of her nose, out of her eyes and her ears and her mouth and she had to call extra attention to her to breath, to make sure that she was taking in enough oxygen to sustain this heighted level of current.

Jim stood up. He pushed his chair in. He didn’t look Janet in the eye, but he snarled. And before he slammed the door on his way out, he said in a low but measured voice, “Fucking bitch. You stupid fucking cunt.”"

I live in a stressful struggling single mother home environment with three other siblings, so I decided to study for the LSAT. I noticed I was never really able to read efficiently and my grades were pretty poor most of my life, so my doctor diagnosed me ADHD and prescribed me Adderall IR 10 mg which then went to 20 mg during full time law school. I lost complete control of my Adderall intake and one point and fell into another toxic relationship. I was barely able to show up to class because of my anxiety and depression. It was at this point I was prescribed Lexapro 10 mg and it was like a god send at first. I was able to get control of my life and do what I had too, but it's almost too late as this is my last year and I blew so many job interviews and loan money.

 I did have two good internships over the course of law school, but felt like there was something wrong with me at both jobs even though I got through (one of them being a big law firm, the other the White House). My family completely resented me when I got back for this year on Lexapro 10 mg and I don't know if it's because my mother helped me financially while I was in Washington or they resent me for being the one to get on an antidepressant which allowed me to go out and do things, although I still remain on Adderall. 

So to please them, I tried to come off the Lexapro 10 mg and go all the way down to Adderall IR 10 mg again, and my anxiety was so brutal I was barely able to get out of my bed. It was almost like I created a life too big for me to handle in a sober state. Here I am back on Adderall XR 25 mg and Lexapro 10 mg waiting for class to start. My family thinks I'm heading for disaster and I'm still in the same relationship."

In the summer of 2011 I was living with my dad on break from college in this little fishing village. I'd always lived there but I didn't really know too many people around all that well because most of my friends had gone to school and were off doing internships and on various adventures. For some backstory, I'm a pretty big guy, and I was around 21 at the time all this happened. My dad's neighborhood is kind of an abandoned residential area that was full of people when my brother and I were kids, but people either grew up or moved out or died, so my dad was one of the only people who still lived on our street. For some more backstory, I have a pretty unique name, both first and last, old family names. I'm one of three known people in the US with my name (according to the internet).

So around May this acquaintance who graduated from my university the previous year shoots me an email to tell me a funny anecdote about someone who just applied for work at a company where he's the HR. The guy looked fairly normal, maybe a little bit 'street' but not excessively so, but once he got into the interview started acting skittish and strange. He made several references to ""his niggas and bitches"" and went off on tangents about parties he'd thrown at his house. The kicker is, he gave my name, my home state, and the general area where my parents live as his personal information. He also gave quite a bit of information about where I went to school despite that not being public information. No phone, no social, no address. He didn't seem particularly upset to learn that he didn't get the job, just kind of zonked out. The guy who sent it to me thought it was funny and kind of strange as he didn't know my name was so rare, we laughed about it and it never really came up again.

After that I started getting some interesting phone calls. Not even pranks, just people who called to speak to someone and seemed genuinely confused that I wasn't that person. A few calls from my job saying ""Hey this is Amy (boss's name), I'm going to need you to come it at 5 today"" and then when I got there the boss hadn't called me and everyone was just confused. This one may have been a friend, as one of my friends was pretty into pranks and prank phone calls. I don't know how he would have spoofed my boss's voice though, and he vehemently denied it. Sometimes people would call and just say unsettling things, nothing violent or scary but wouldn't give straight answers to questions. Eventually every time I saw a number I didn't recognize I'd answer the phone with ""who are you and how did you get this number"". Nine times out of ten it was someone from work saying ""chill, dude, I need someone to cover my shift, but occasionally I'd get muffled sobbing with inaudible voices in the background. 

On two occasion I received a call from an older man who claimed to be some kind of federal agent working with the local police, but wouldn't give me his name or any concrete information about why he was calling me. I have no idea how he got my cell phone. I eventually called the local police station's non emergency line and they told me they didn't have anyone like that working with them. Sometime after that, several of my friends got the same call, some asking for information about me and some asking for information about some random guy none of us had heard of. Eventually one of my acquaintances got the call and passed the phone onto his cop dad, who promptly told the guy to fuck off. He never called back after that. 

In mid July I got home late one night, friends dropped me off, and about a half hour later I see a sedan pull into my driveway and just sit there with the lights off. My dad's driveway is a good 100+ feet long so I have an okay view of them, but they wouldn't necessarily be able to see the house because of the distance and the trees. The friend who just dropped me off has a sedan, so I assume he forgot something, but the car just sits there, and then drives off about 5 minutes later. I didn't really think anything of it. The car came back every few nights for the rest of the summer, sometime between 2:30 and 3:30 AM. It wasn't anyone I knew, and they weren't leaving the paper. Sometimes they'd show up when I was out for a smoke, and I'd stand in the driveway and wave. They never did anything threatening and were always gone in under ten minutes so I never thought to call the police.

One time I made plans with a friend to drive around and get food around 2:30 AM, and I see the headlights coming down the driveway. Being slightly drunk and thinking it's my friend, I start howling like a madman and charge toward the car with my hands in the air. When I get about 40 feet away the car peels out of the driveway and speeds off, and I can see that it's the same beat up sedan from a few weeks ago. About two minutes later my actual friend shows up and tells me there's a dented sedan idling in an abandoned parking lot down the road, which is noteworthy because we live in the middle of nowhere and it's weird to see *anyone* driving around at night. We drove by the lot, the car pulled out behind us, and tailed us until we sped up, pulled into a neighborhood, turned the lights off, and watched them drive by real slow. We went out looking for them a few minutes later but no one was on the roads. They came by maybe once after that but didn't stay long. After that summer they never came back, and nothing ever happened at the house, no break ins or anything.

Since then I haven't heard anything about the guy who used my name, or whoever was parking in my driveway, or the fake ""agent"". Never found out who it was, and none of my friends or my brother's friends drive a car like that. The inaudible phone calls dwindled until I was getting one once every few months, then stopped entirely around April of 2012.

The kicker is, he gave my name, my home state, and the general area where my parents live as his personal information. He also gave quite a bit of information about where I went to school despite that not being public information. No phone, no social, no address. He didn't seem particularly upset to learn that he didn't get the job, just kind of zonked out. The guy who sent it to me thought it was funny and kind of strange as he didn't know my name was so rare, we laughed about it and it never really came up again.

After that I started getting some interesting phone calls. Not even pranks, just people who called to speak to someone and seemed genuinely confused that I wasn't that person. A few calls from my job saying ""Hey this is Amy (boss's name), I'm going to need you to come it at 5 today"" and then when I got there the boss hadn't called me and everyone was just confused. This one may have been a friend, as one of my friends was pretty into pranks and prank phone calls. I don't know how he would have spoofed my boss's voice though, and he vehemently denied it. Sometimes people would call and just say unsettling things, nothing violent or scary but wouldn't give straight answers to questions. Eventually every time I saw a number I didn't recognize I'd answer the phone with ""who are you and how did you get this number"". Nine times out of ten it was someone from work saying ""chill, dude, I need someone to cover my shift, but occasionally I'd get muffled sobbing with inaudible voices in the background. 

On two occasion I received a call from an older man who claimed to be some kind of federal agent working with the local police, but wouldn't give me his name or any concrete information about why he was calling me. I have no idea how he got my cell phone. I eventually called the local police station's non emergency line and they told me they didn't have anyone like that working with them. Sometime after that, several of my friends got the same call, some asking for information about me and some asking for information about some random guy none of us had heard of. Eventually one of my acquaintances got the call and passed the phone onto his cop dad, who promptly told the guy to fuck off. He never called back after that. 

In mid July I got home late one night, friends dropped me off, and about a half hour later I see a sedan pull into my driveway and just sit there with the lights off. My dad's driveway is a good 100+ feet long so I have an okay view of them, but they wouldn't necessarily be able to see the house because of the distance and the trees. The friend who just dropped me off has a sedan, so I assume he forgot something, but the car just sits there, and then drives off about 5 minutes later. I didn't really think anything of it. The car came back every few nights for the rest of the summer, sometime between 2:30 and 3:30 AM. It wasn't anyone I knew, and they weren't leaving the paper. Sometimes they'd show up when I was out for a smoke, and I'd stand in the driveway and wave. They never did anything threatening and were always gone in under ten minutes so I never thought to call the police.

One time I made plans with a friend to drive around and get food around 2:30 AM, and I see the headlights coming down the driveway. Being slightly drunk and thinking it's my friend, I start howling like a madman and charge toward the car with my hands in the air. When I get about 40 feet away the car peels out of the driveway and speeds off, and I can see that it's the same beat up sedan from a few weeks ago. About two minutes later my actual friend shows up and tells me there's a dented sedan idling in an abandoned parking lot down the road, which is noteworthy because we live in the middle of nowhere and it's weird to see *anyone* driving around at night. We drove by the lot, the car pulled out behind us, and tailed us until we sped up, pulled into a neighborhood, turned the lights off, and watched them drive by real slow. We went out looking for them a few minutes later but no one was on the roads. They came by maybe once after that but didn't stay long. After that summer they never came back, and nothing ever happened at the house, no break ins or anything.

Since then I haven't heard anything about the guy who used my name, or whoever was parking in my driveway, or the fake ""agent"". Never found out who it was, and none of my friends or my brother's friends drive a car like that. The inaudible phone calls dwindled until I was getting one once every few months, then stopped entirely around April of 2012.

3qnj4y,3,2015-10-28,ICYMI - Recap of Press Conference,DadeBrigade,MiamiFC,https://www.reddit.com/r/MiamiFC/comments/3qnj4y/icymi_recap_of_press_conference/,"Press Conference Recap, if you didn't watch the Periscope feed (https://www.periscope.tv/w/1vAGRZyEnOYGl)

First question asked by us was to Cesar Velasco about friendlies to be played. Cesar said we will have at least 1 international friendly in the summer.

We found Bruce Silverman (the TV personality for the Strikers) who immediately welcomed Miami FC to the league. We had someone via Periscope ask if there were any renovations planned for Lockhart which Bruce confirmed were in the works.

And then I totally goofed and mistakenly misnamed the COO and called him Darren McFadden LOL His name is Darren McCartney or affectionately known as Run DMC wink emoticon

The Press conference officially began with FIU AD Pete Garcia getting straight to business and thanking everyone in attendance and recognizing Bill Talbott and Jose Sotolongo and then went straight to introducing Mayor Carlos Gimenez.

Mayor Gimenez quipped ""Thank you for hosting us in this beautiful already built stadium..."" He gave the obligatory thanks to all in attendance and then welcomed Pro soccer back to Miami. Talked about how perfect FIU the Miami Dade based State University is a choice as home field. Finished up by saying he can't wait to come back and watch a dominant performance and being part of a large crowd.

Next Mr. Garcia recognized Miami FC CEO Antonio Barreto and Oceans Bank Cheryl Rees. (FIU stadium is known as Oceans Bank Field)

Mr. Garcia then introduced FIU President Dr. Mark Rosenberg as a sports fan and especially a soccer fan and how when designing the stadium they did it with soccer in mind. Dr. Rosenberg fondly remembered how his interest in soccer started with a scissor kick by Mueller in the '70 world cup. He talked about how Miami is a global city and thanks Riccardo Silva and his team are visionaries within a visionary community and now at a visionary school, FIU. Thanks NASL Commissioner Bill Peterson. He said ""we like to build win, win, win relationships....FIU, South Florida, Miami FC; what could be better?"" ""We know Miami is soccer hungry,"" He was also please to announce the gift from Mr. Silva for $450,000 to the FIU athletics department.

Mr. Garcia took the podium and announced that Miami FC would provide FIU students with internships.
The Commissioner of NASL Bill Peterson was up next. Thanked everyone in attendance and spoke about some NASL business and growth and their plans of expansion and Pro / Rel system. He said ""What Miami FC will provide here is a real football club that will play to win and will play for championships and play for their fans..."" He said that on his way in this morning he sent a note back to the main office suggesting FTL Strikers to come down and kick off the 2016 season against Miami FC.

Next up was Riccardo Silva, owner of Miami FC. First he said hello on behalf of Paolo Maldini who was not in the country. He spoke about the legends Maldini and Nesta. He said the key word in this endeavor is Passion...Passion for quality soccer, Passion for the city of Miami and Passion for the community. ""We are here for the long term,"" ""I personally believe that soccer will become as popular, at the same level, as football, basketball and baseball in a one generation span,"" ""We want to build a team to win the league and establish a wonderful rivalry with the NY Cosmos,"" ""By Christmas time we'll have announced some players, some good names, some good players in the prime of their careers who are now playing in top European leagues, and then build a strong base of strong, young, good, american players.""

Mr. Garcia took the podium again and said to Riccardo: ""Riccardo I just want you to know I became a soccer fan watching the world cup watching Maldini block a scissors kick from a German Mueller."" **see above Dr. Rodenberg** Commissioner Francis Suarez was then introduced.

Commissioner Suarez said he considers himself an ambassador of the brand Miami. He went on to discuss the Miami FC Logo and how it represented the Miami brand and Soccer so well. He proudly stated how he was an FIU alum and how proud he was to see this achievement come to fruition. He ended with how honored he was to be part of the event.

The press conference ended. We hung around and asked a couple questions from the panel members.

First was Commissioner Francis Suarez: I asked him to speak to the Periscope viewers and fans. he spoke about how great the growth of soccer and growth of soccer in Miami was so exciting.

Next we caught up with NASL Bill Peterson and I asked him a question posted in the Periscope about expansion and he said no word yet. when ready we'll announce them. There is alot of interest and a lot going on and we will have more teams. I thanked him for helping bring Pro soccer back to Miami. He said that the Front Office was a great group and he was sure it would be successful.

We then found Coach Nesta surrounded in a corner by the on hand media. You can tell he would much rather be playing or coaching than answering questions. Questions were about the player signings and the league. He joked about hiring Gattuso as he has more coaching experience than him. Our own Mario Lara got some questions in as to what style he prefers and Nesta said he wants a good balanced team.

That wrapped up the press conference. A couple of us hung around and got some pictures of the East Side stands which we will call home. A couple photo ops with owner Riccardo Silva and Coach Nesta.

A very exciting day to say the least. Welcome back to Miami Professional Soccer!!!!!"

3qoqe8,7,2015-10-29,My (26M) girlfriend (24F) is not interested in intimacy,legioquack,DeadBedrooms,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/3qoqe8/my_26m_girlfriend_24f_is_not_interested_in/,"We've been together for almost 6 years now, living together for 5.

I've been sexually dissatisfied with the relationship for quite some time now. We never had very frequent sex (highest frequency was about monthly, now once every 6 months), but at least it used to be more engaging and satisfying.

We've been through medical school together and have been through some rough times, but we only took a break once. She went alone on a trip to Europe (in which I suspect she cheated on me)  and demanded that we take a break as soon as she got back. This made me very angry because I had helped plan the trip and had payed for a significant portion of it, but I reluctantly agreed to it. She was intimate with other people during the break, which hurt me a lot, but I got over it and we got back together shortly after that. My family was very critical of that and they suggested that she was only doing it because they are very well connected in the medical community and she wanted to get ahead. 

The decline in the satisfaction with our sex life was gradual. Initially I just assumed we were both under a lot of stress, and we were. She was genuinely tired or stressed at some points,
and I respected that. But before I had noticed something was wrong we had gone 2 months without having sex, and the intervals kept getting longer. Nowadays the sex we do have is associated with important events, like being on vacation somewhere, but I can't shake the feeling that she's disgusted by it and only doing it to indulge me.

I initially attributed the whole thing to me getting out of shape and her not being physically attracted to me anymore. Now, I didn't fall off the wagon and become morbidly obese, I just wasn't working out in the gym 2-4 hours per day anymore. This resulted in overall less muscle mass. Some of you will probably tell me to just go back to the gym, but that's out of the picture now. I'm almost done with med school and will be going into my internship, which leaves very little time for sleep, let alone working out. 

Another potental reason I tried to address was me being less interesting to her. I tried to deal with this by reading up on her favorite novelists so that we could talk about something other than med school. This worked well in the sense that we had long and interesting conversations, but it did nothing for the sexual side of things. 

I've tried being very attentive. I bring her flowers frequently, I buy small gifts I know she'll like (usually candy), I've tried organizing date nights for us. I leave her care packages by the bed when I know she'll be coming in after a night shift. These are all pretty generic attempts at improving things, but I was hoping at least one would stick. 

Lately, if I try to initiate sex she dismisses it by giving me an assignment. It sounds ridiculous but that's exactly what it is. These past few weeks it's been statistical analysis for a paper she wants to publish, before that it was help with designing a prototype, and before that I was helping her write to potential mentors for a rotation. There's always a crisis that needs handling, but it seems to me that she's only concerned about these things when I try to approach her. 

I've tried talking to her about it, but she usually shuts me down by telling me that she's just tired and stressed, and that a lot is at stake right now. She doesn't seem upset in the least that we are not intimate anymore. 

I feel unwanted, used even. I know I'm probably just another mysogynistic pig wanting to get laid, and I hate myself for it, but I can't take it anymore. 

Soon I'll have to decide whether or not I marry this girl or not, and I need solutions. Is it just med school? Will it get better?"

3qp15x,2,2015-10-29,"Me [23M] with a semi-ex [22F] pushing convention boundaries, and I don't know what to think about it",Notably,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3qp15x/me_23m_with_a_semiex_22f_pushing_convention/,"Alright, so I'm mostly writing this to evaluate what I think of my own situation. This won't be exceptionally written either, as I'm on my phone on lunch break.
&amp;nbsp;

Bit of context: I've had three one- to two-year relationships in the past. The most recent was a beautiful relationship that ended on good terms. That girl (""Estelle"") and I were so emotionally secure together that we decided to have an open relationship after she changed cities. Neither of us ended up doing much, but I could see a whole new world of dating. It never went beyond making out with other girls. I realized that this sort of physical interaction didn't affect my love for Estelle. After breaking up and hooking up with a few other girls, I affirmed that my feelings for Estelle were just as real. All this to say that I genuinely believe that fooling around with people other than a SO doesn't necessarily affect your feelings for them, and I thus believe open relationships can work for me.

&amp;nbsp;

About 8 months after Estelle and I broke up, I met pretty date-worthy girl. We'll call her Lily. She's a smart, hot, ex-model, studying finance to start a nonprofit. We meet when we’re both inebriated, and end up having sex on the grass at a party about 45 minutes later. Great first impressions were made. I go on a date with her the next week, and not three days later she asks me to come out boating with her and her family. This is moving pretty fast, but I’m really into this girl, so I go ahead with it. Her parents love me, and all is well. We have a lot in common, and get along beautifully for a month or so, seeing each other several times a week. After a couple weeks, I ask if we’re gearing toward a relationship. More or less, she says relationships freak her out because she’s had a really rocky past, but says that she’s “not saying no.” 
&amp;nbsp;

Until she starts acting off, less intimate, and stands me up one night with a bad excuse. I say I want to talk, she says she doesn't think she has the answers I'm looking for. We don't talk to eachother for a few days, and she leaves on tour for a couple weeks afterward. I get pretty emotionally destroyed, not knowing what happened. I know what she did was shitty of her, and so when she texts me with ""Hey, hope you're doing okay"" 10 days later, I ignore her. About a week after, she's changed her profile pic to her with another dude, so I take her off my newsfeed and focus on moving on (around mid-July).
&amp;nbsp;

After two weeks of hard times, things really pick up. I do all the classic post-breakup things: working out, focusing on work, spending time with friends etc to move on and get my head right. I end up having one of the best months of my life; great friendships, awesome sexual adventures every weekend, great results in my internships and just generally becoming the best I can be. 
Rewind to two weeks ago, I've got three girls who want casual+ things on the go. I'm over Lily, and I decide that I may as well delete her from facebook. I'm mildly surprised to see she's deleted me first. I message her asking why, just for fun. Feeling curious, and pretty unshakeable. She ends up insinuating that we could talk about what happened, and within a few minutes of me messaging her, she's changed her profile pic to one without the dude. 
&amp;nbsp;

I decide to go into this with zero expectations, but rather to forgive her so that I can really make peace with what happened. We meet at a coffee shop, and have all sorts of small-medium talk. She doesn’t normally wear make-up, but she was decked out that night. Eventually, I tell her about the fact that I got pretty messed up after she left the way she did, but keeping the tone casual. She apologizes, saying she got cold feet, and thought I was no longer interested after texting her back. I asked if she had started something with the dude when we were already together (which is what I had assumed), and she shakes her head, saying she met him on tour. 
&amp;nbsp;

We take a little walk, and I’m headed toward my car to leave. My car’s about 10 minutes from her apartment. Lo and behold, my phone dies as I get to my car, and I literally won’t be able to find my new apartment without GPS (I’m a med intern who changes places every month). She’s not in a hurry for me to leave, and offers that I charge it at her place. Meanwhile, I’ve decided I’m pretty okay with exploring the dangerous territory of sleeping with her while the scar from this summer has only just healed. 
&amp;nbsp;

At her apartment, we talk, cuddle, listen to music. We have a heart to heart, and I go to kiss her, but she’s nervous about it. She says she’s worried we’ll just go back to where we were. She’s leaving for the better part of a year in January, so now wouldn’t be a great time for that. I say I don’t really see the problem if we both know that we don’t want a relationship. I tell her I’m not down to be friends with her without the physical component of our relationship. It’s around 3am now, and I work in 5 hours. She says she’ll think about it, and I peace out.
&amp;nbsp;

The next day, she texts me “So, I’ve thought about it, and I agree with your philosophy. I’m dtf.” However, the dude she met in the states is coming up to visit her for a week, so it’ll have to be after that. I’m not really sure what the nature of their relationship is, but I decide it doesn’t really bother me.
&amp;nbsp;

A week later, she starts sending me glorious sexts. This past weekend, I end up going to see her at her parents’ place (we’re both now living 1.5h away from our previous apartments), which is where we would always see each other when we were dating. I’m not really sure what the lay of the land is, but I agree. We chill with her parents for a few hours, campfire, dinner and all. Around 10pm, we’re left alone in the living room, and start getting frisky. Her paranoia about her parents seeing us interact on a more than friend basis doesn’t stop us from getting it on in her living room. We kiss and talk afterward, and we’re in a pretty good place. When it comes time for bed, she had figured I would sleep at my place, about half an hour away. I say that I had kind of presumed we’d be in the same bed, but she tells me that she doesn’t want her parents seeing her sleeping with another guy when she’s in a relationship with someone else (the other dude). 
&amp;nbsp;

I feel pretty salty about this, but I’m too tired to argue, so I ask to sleep in the guest room since I’m too fucked to drive (0sleep/48h). The next morning, I’m wondering how I feel bout her being in a relationship with this other guy when she got cold feet with me. She says it’s because he’s half a continent away, and so there’s no pressure. We both admit we have feelings for each other despite this. In theory, I’m all for relationships outside of convention. We chill for the rest of the day, cuddling and kissing. I leave before supper, and she texts me a few times, one telling me that her parents say she’s happier with me and asks why we’re not dating.
&amp;nbsp;

Even though I genuinely don’t want a relationship right now, I have feelings for this girl. She has feelings for me, but there’s an obvious inequality of her being the one who broke up with me, and her having a bf at the moment. I, on the other hand, still have my eyes open have a couple other interested girls, so it’s not all that bad of a situation. She’s supposed to come see me on a weekly-ish basis. I have a feeling that we’re not going to stay “friends with benefits” in the sense that we have too many feelings for each other, but we’re not going to be in a relationship either. I don’t know how much it matters to me that she has a distance bf, considering that I might be going to see my ex Estelle at a show she’s putting on (haven’t talked to her about this yet, nor even talked to her in a year), and I have to admit that I’m able to have feelings for both her and Lily at the same time.
So what do, reddit? How to feel, reddit?

&amp;nbsp;

**tl;dr**: I’m seeing a girl I was dating for 6ish weeks at the beginning of the summer, she has a boyfriend in an open relationship, but we have feelings for each other, and I’m not sure how much this matters.

I'll still be in school next fall, so it seems like it wouldn't throw a wrench too much in my life if I go back, and it would be a huge relief to my council not to have to find a new program director.

But part of me knows I can't work there forever, and I'd really like to find an adult internship if it's possible (although I have no idea how to go about doing that - I've been at summer camp for every summer since high school.)  Camp just doesn't add anything new to my resume, and I would hate to be unemployed after college (even though that's already more than likely)

Any advice?"

I am just curious about other people's experience with internships were and what companies to look at besides Red Hat."

3qqqy5,5,2015-10-29,"Me [26 F] with my manager [60's M] - How to not cry in evaluation, but express frustrations?",BadBossBigCryBaby,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3qqqy5/me_26_f_with_my_manager_60s_m_how_to_not_cry_in/,"So I guess this is a two part question-
I have this issue that whenever I'm being evaluated (like a 3 month evaluation, or a 1 year (which is coming up)) something about the stress of being in a one on one (or one on two because HR is usually also there) makes me cry. It's like my emotions are on high and if I'm upset or bothered by anything, I start crying, it's really frustrating. It's definitely made worse by it being a scheduled meeting specifically set for evaluation - I have no problem with criticism and encourage it from my boss and co-workers so I can better understand what they want and how to improve, and I have no problem when someone pulls me aside and tells me these things. I guess the ""surprise"" of not knowing it's coming and not psyching myself out keeps my emotions in check. Conversely having it scheduled and the build up to it - is awful.

In my 3 month I started to break down just going the regular evaluation stuff. I said it was because my boss kept talking to me about how I should really try to get a masters, and shouldn't wait until I'm older, because he thinks I'm too intelligent not to pursue one, and they offer some tuition reimbursement (i think it's like 25%), but even with that I know I can never afford it (I have about 200k in debt from undergrad), so he was just reminding me of a dream I can never have. But to be fair, that was only a small cause, and I don't know how to stop the waterworks from coming.
Even thinking about what would be said in my coming up evaluation I start to get worked up.


Now for part two: I have a lot of issues with my current boss that I'd love for us to discuss so we can remedy, but I know I can't do it without crying. Again it's just something about the build up of emotion. Even trying to practice what I'd say when I was alone I get worked up, it's ridiculous.
I know part of it is from how I feel like I'm being treated: Like I'm doing the job of 4 full time people, but treated as an intern (I am full-time, by the way).
Unfortunately my boss is a bit of an absentee boss, he's the ""Global Director"" of Sales and my division, but really his background is in Sales, so there's where most of his time goes, including traveling to clients in the state area. Plus he's been working for 30+ years, and I'm entry level.

On top of that he's not great at ""managing"" in general. Originally when I started he gave hardly any input on my priorities, I'd usually have to hunt him down and tell him what I was working on and if that was okay. Why am I chasing him down to tell him what my priorities are? Shouldn't he be asking and checking in on me? In the 3month eval. he said his absentee-style was on purpose because he was testing how well I'd ""float"" if they let things be thrown at me. He said I did well, but that I said ""yes"" to too many projects and from there on he wanted every other department head to go through him about a project, and he would delegate to me what to work on. I'm the *only* one in my department (except technically him). And while that doesn't sound like a poor strategy, he's my manger, of course he should delegate; the problem is that he sucks at communicating with both me and the rest of the department heads. He uses his judgement to decide what I work on, and his judgement doesn't always make sense 

- e.g. they have a weekly leadership meeting and in it it was discussed that I would work on X project and would have a draft done by X Date, well he sat on the project for a whole week without mentioning it to me. Another co-worker mentioned it to me and it was the first I heard of it, but assumed he would delegate when he wanted me to start. Boss off-handedly mentions it to me once that week, but didn't give me the materials I need to work on it until another week later (about 2 weeks past the original due date). He didn't update the management team that there were delays (assuming he thought there were other things more important for me to work on, which might have been the case, but still...). And he didn't actually give me the project until _another_ co-worker (the one whom it directly affects) asked me about it, and then later that day I brought it up again when he was back in the office, at least now having the valid excuse that X was asking for it. Turns out he wanted to to do it his particular way (which wasn't possible, and unfortunately anyone with technical knowledge in the area would have known that right away), and _still_ made me wait another day while he hashed out part of it (that part something I could have easily done-3 weeks ago). Also not to mention that this reflects on _me_ to the management team, because I don't communicate directly with them, he does.

On top of that he's *very* stubborn when he has an opinion on something. And unfortunately whenever I try to challenge his opinion (I only disagree when I have legitimate evidence to support me), because I think there's a better/more efficient way, somehow to him that comes across as me being the very opinionated/stubborn one, even though he never supports his opinions.
I also think it doesn't help that I'm female, it _was_ mentioned in my first evaluation that he thinks I'm too aggressive, and I can't help but think it's not in part due to my gender, I feel like if I was male, he wouldn't have thought twice about it.


Which segues into my next issue – the industry my company is in is definitely very male dominated. There are other females in the company but the bulk are just in administrative roles (HR, customer service, accounting, etc.) there's only 1 female engineer, and of the 4 divisions of the company, the scattered few are again just in administrative roles.
So I have no *proof* that the reason I'm excluded for meetings that would be relevant and helpful is because I'm female, and if asked I 100% think he would say it's not (but who admits to that? most people aren't female-biased intentionally, and give that he's in his sixties it's not hard to think of what he'd expect given the generational differences). Most of these meetings would be with engineers (all guys (the one girl works on a different aspect and wouldn't be involved)), or other teams of all men. He mentioned once that he ""spared"" me from a meeting (try excluding...), and I can't help but thinking his opinion is that either I would a) come off too strongly in a meeting (which in a group meeting I'm usually very quiet), or b) have nothing to add and there's no value for me being there (again, I disagree, but since I only hear about these meetings in happenstance, and never have full details of them, It's next to impossible to get a chance to justify why I should be included).

There's also meetings that would be directly relevant to my department, that he decides not to include me on, and I have no idea the reason. Again, unfortunately in most of these cases I don't find out until afterwards that there even was a meeting taking place, so it's not like I could try to make a case ahead of time of what value I would add.


I'm extremely frustrated and feel like my opinion is never taking seriously. I feel like I he's supposed to be managing me, but is, and I feel like I could manage myself, but because he withholds everything, I can't.

There's so many other issues, and this just scratches the tip, but hopefully that gives you an idea. Plus in general he comes across as a relatively laid-back guy, so it's not like I can call him out for being stiff. He's only so stubborn when he has a pre-formed opinion of something. And again, I can't bring this up without crying...

Anyways I'm not sure how to even begin to discuss all these issues. I've only been here a year and wanted a few more years of experience under my belt before I jumped ship to a different job, but I've already started looking. Still, I need to know what to do if I can't find anything else and I'm still stuck here.

Also worth noting his boss is the CEO, so it's not like I can just walk into his office and start complaining. They've worked together for like 10+ years, so that conversation would likely fall on deaf ears, and/or I'd just be seen as the young whining female child...
Oh did I mention the average age of the company is probably mid-forties? Plenty of people have kids who are older than me...
   
**tl;dr**: My boss is stubborn, doesn't know how to be a manager, and it's reflected in my performance. Also I can't set aside time to talk about these things without bawling because I can't keep my emotions in check."

Another game I'd love to play is Divinity Original Sin, but I am afraid it could have the same poor performance on my system.

On my backlog there is a lot to play: Wasteland 2, Fallout New Vegas, KOTOR2, Shadowrun Dragonfall, Planescape Torment and Baldur's Gate EE.
For the moment I would like to go with a game that is arround 30-40 hours.

3qrqxv,2,2015-10-29,Met a client. Now I can't stop thinking about him.,FancyHatPerson,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3qrqxv/met_a_client_now_i_cant_stop_thinking_about_him/,"Okay well.. This I really need to get off of my chest because I really can't stop thinking about this client I met today for my internship. 

In a nutshell: I'm a student following an internship of an illustrator.. So we got an assignment from this man to make an illustration of his team and colleagues. Today me and another internee had to drop it off at this big building and meet up with him. 

Now my job was to make an initial sketch for the illustration. I also received a picture of him and on that picture he didn't look all that fancy.. So I didn't have much expectation. I was more nervous about the fact that we had to drop the paintings at this big busy building in the middle of a big city. 

But then he walked in and omg. Wow.. I was literally stunned. The other internee seriously had to push me or I would've kept staring at him like an idiot. Really.. He looked like my ideal type! Regardless of status etc. He was seriously exactly the kind of guy I have always described as my dream guy... And that only happened once.. Ten years ago, also very painful and embarrassing moments I don't want to recall.. 

So I was stunned. Normally I can give polite and professional talk to any client we have to meet but this time. No. Nothing. I just timidly stood next to my friend who did the talking. (so unfortunately he looked at her more than at me grrrr hahaha) 

Since that encounter I have been thinking about him and it's so annoying! I went to sleep at 10.30 and woke up at 11.45.. I had a very vivid dream about him asking me out on a date. It is so frustrating! 

Out of clear annoyance and desperation, because when I 'fall in love at first sight' I really 'fall in love at first sight'.. It's the love sickness without a happy ending, I signed up at dating sites because... I really don't know why haha. 

Well... Today I can tell my mentor about this... He'll probably laugh his ass off, the other internee also finds this Hilarious and cute and I don't know what else to do but find myself very annoying for the next few days..

Now trying to go back to sleep and hopefully Dreamboat Client won't appear."

3qrrof,5,2015-10-29,Finding it really hard to keep up motivation now that I'm not disgusted with myself.,TitusAndrogynous,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/3qrrof/finding_it_really_hard_to_keep_up_motivation_now/,"Stats first! **F/24/5'5"" SW: 164 CW: 144 GW: 130**

I'm diligent some days about keeping to my limit, and I feel very proud those days, but more and more often I slip and become complacent with going to maintenance. Part of this is because I've started grad school, so I juggle that, an internship, work, and dealing with worsening depression due to the season change (fuck you, fall!). It's easy to rationalize not cooking a meal for myself or having an extra treat when I feel like I'm going to tear my eyeballs out. I do have a therapist, use coloring books, exercise regularly, and do mindful meditations, I just need to work more on time management and discipline when it comes to food.

The other part is because I don't hate my body so much anymore. I'm not *happy* with where I am, but I feel a lot sexier than I did before, and friends and family compliment me on how great I look now. This has sapped my motivation, and as great as it is that I feel better about my body, I am absolutely not where I want to be. I just can't rely on staring in the mirror to strengthen my resolve as much anymore.

Have any of you dealt with the same kind of motivation loss? How did you boost your motivation? Thanks in advance, y'all!"

I did this, I know exactly what I was doing yet I still did.   

I've been dating my now ex gf for 5 years, of which we were always happy.  Never fought, never argued, always saw eye to eye, planned our futur out together, hell we were even set on leaving for a new area for work (as I'm almost done school).  We always had it good, we were living together, both had jobs, our own routines and habits until I decided to go back to school to further my education and get a real career once I was out.  I left home and went off to school (7hours away) where I stayed in an apartment for the first 6 months, came back home (for 2 months) to complete an internship in my field, and went back to school 2 months ago to a new apartment.  So now I'm in this 5 year relationship which seemed completely flawless, both content and super used to each other, apart from the fact that sometimes we lacked excitement, and every once in a while I would get this feeling of ""what if"".  ""What if I was single, would it be more fun?"" ""What if I had the freedom to do whatever..."" Blah blah blah, and Every time I would get that feeling I would realize how stupid I was to think like that since I seemed to have a near perfect relationship. I always felt safe with her, secure, happy but at the same time a little too much in a routine.  Moving back out of the house 2 months ago gave me this feeling of freedom, something I hadn't felt in a while and it felt nice. I ended up meeting the other people staying in the building, couple cool and interesting characters, along with this one girl staying in the neighbouring building. Saw her as a cool person, seemed fun and outgoing, nothing more.  Well only one week after moving into this new place, that's where I fucked up.  We were all out at a local event, and to make a long story short I kissed her.   I have absolutely no idea what came over me, it felt like I was on autopilot. It felt new and exciting, but realizing what I had done that night is when I woke up from this autopilot and it just hit me like a bomb.  I felt like the worst person in the world for what I did and I could not stop thinking about it.  I slept terribly, felt horrible and eventually after a couple days decided that I could not postpone this any longer and drove home to come clean.  I didn't tell her exactly what happened, but I did break it off and it was hard. It seemed like the only option as I could not lead her on or lie to her.  It was devastating for me to hurt her that much, so I can't even imagine how bad she must have felt.  Weather she feels less terrible not knowing I kissed another girl, that is what I'm second guessing.   I'm still in contact with this new girl, but I can't stop thinking about my ex.  I still see her in my futur, I still imagine us happy again.  I can't help but to feel like I owe her an explanation, but I don't know if telling her the whole story will hurt her more.  I really do want her to stop hurting, I saw her recently and she was doing quite well.  She hasn't given up and quit life, in fact she's growing more independent after this whole situation.  Without getting into to much detail, I really do miss her and I'm completely lost.  I know some of you must think I'm a piece of shit for what I did, but please know I have never done this before.  I never thought I would be able to do this, and I regret it more than I even realize it.  

Tl;dr.  Was in a very happy and stable 5 year relationship, moved away for school and ended up kissing a girl.  Drove 7h home to confess, ended up breaking it off claiming it was out of a situational decision, now thinking I should have told her the absolute truth but unsure if it will hurt her more or put closure to this situation.   

Please help, I have no idea what to do."

3qs1io,1,2015-10-29,Frustrated with my Risk Management internship. Any advice on how to deal with this position and find a better position next year?,AutomatedBeehive,entj,https://www.reddit.com/r/entj/comments/3qs1io/frustrated_with_my_risk_management_internship_any/,"Hi All,

Through my college, I have a program where I work for six months, and attend classes for six months. I have to do three of these cycles before I graduate. I’m about a month into my first position as a Risk Management Intern at a large utility company. I chose this internship because I thought it would give me good work experience, the people who I met at the company seemed happy at the company, and the pay was pretty good, especially for an internship. 

Like most ENTJ's, I like to be able to use my brain to come up with creative ways to solve problems, or work with others to plan or create new things. I hoped that I would get to use some of those skills in my position. 

Unfortunately, I do not. At my current position, I work on the opposite side of the building as my co-workers, so I don’t get much human interaction. My job consists of updating and manipulating a series of excel spreadsheets to reflect new daily data. These tasks are highly routine, and little to no thought needed for most of them. However, one error in a spreadsheet can cause issues elsewhere in the company, so it’s very important to check all tiny details very carefully. Additionally, I never got the opportunity to understand exactly how what I do benefits the company. As a big picture person that likes to work with other people, this is a terrible position for me.
  
Adding to my frustration is that I perceive my position as largely inefficient and not a good way of doing things. A computer program could do my job in a fraction of the time and make no errors in processing, unlike a human. Alternatively, they could outsource my position and get it done at a fraction of the cost and to a higher degree of professionalism. This isn’t just an issue in my position, however. There are so many tasks in the department done by full time employees that would seem to be more accurate and cost effective with outsourcing and automation. It makes frustrated to see what looks like such inefficiency.

In trying to be less frustrated with my internship, I’ve been tinkering with automating my position in my free time after work. However, my efforts have been slow as I lack significant programming experience and I am unable to bring home many of the documents I would need to work on because they contain sensitive financial information.

I guess my question is two-fold.

*1. How to I stay sane at this position which provides no avenue for independent thought or advancement I am interested in?*

*2. What sort of positions should I look for next internship cycle to make sure that I have a more rewarding and fulfilling experience?*

I heard around mid-November is usually when they get around to applicants, but I would just like a second opinion towards that.

3qtlzv,3,2015-10-30,[Question] Offered a job after overstaying a student visa in the US,kaml9_throwaway,immigration,https://www.reddit.com/r/immigration/comments/3qtlzv/question_offered_a_job_after_overstaying_a/,"Throwaway because I don't want to get in trouble.

I overstayed my student visa because I was no longer able to afford college and didn't even have the money to go back home and support myself. I was able to work as an interpreter with the tax ID number I had for my internship. After almost 2 years, I was able to save enough money and left the country.

Now, I'm still an interpreter and a company in Boston wants to hire me because there is very high demand for the languages I work with. They are aware of my situation but they hired a lawyer that says he can get me an employment visa. I think he just wants to make some money.

I'm posting here because the owner of the company is a really good person and also, I don't want to get my hopes up.

Some considerations:

- I entered the States with a tourist visa and then changed it for an F-1
- My parents and siblings are now US citizens. I couldn't change my status because I was over 21 years-old
- I never got in trouble other than this. I always filed and paid my taxes
- I left on my own will and AFAIK, I don't have a deportation order because I never moved when I was living in the US.
- The lawyer says that because my I-94 records don't show on the DHS website, he ""might be able to work things out"". I think he's lying.
- Even if I'm not banned, I will have to declare that I did overstayed my student visa, won't I?

I need some clarity on this. Is there a way I can re-enter the US legally? Is the lawyer lying? What do you think?

Thanks

3qtm3i,1023,2015-10-30,"Sexual harassment from our intern, Saturn...",hwaa,fatpeoplestories,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/3qtm3i/sexual_harassment_from_our_intern_saturn/,"I do need to get it off my chest.. A day has passed, most of my rage's gone and it feels actually funny now.

I work as a coder in an R&amp;D company in Turkey.. We're a successful company contracting both for academic circles and defence/energy sector, so we receive quite a few interns. The last one was, forgive me I don't know the exact English counterpart of the profession but I guess it's called GIS - Geographical Information Systems engineer. Let's call her Saturn, the huge antromorphic pear.

Yesterday, she got fired.. This is her story.

When she got introduced first, there were quite a few warning signs I somehow ignored. We had a project about automating the right of passage for emergency vehicles in traffic and all that remains was reporting the daily activity on the map. Saturn had claimed she had great expertise in C#, so I delegated the application to Saturn, telling her it would look great on her CV and she could ask me about everything 24/7. FIRST WARNING: Her looks become glazed, as if she was thinking ""I can't distinguish if you're a hamburger or a human being..""

Mind you, I'm happily married with two daughters, my ring's quite visible and my desk's decorated with photos of my wife and kids. I was sincere and polite and I'm very careful in keeping my professional distance. Anyway, I had felt I was becoming the target of a teensy bit of crush so to ensure it doesn't grow to anything uncomfortable, I made up an excuse to call my wife and spoke loudly for about fifteen minutes, ensuring I phrased ""I missed you"" and ""I love you"" at least once in five minutes.

The second warning sign wasn't way too late. During lunch, in a nearby restaurant, we had the privilege of learning that Saturn was bisexual. The actual topic was quadcopters and how we could add a hook system to pick up toupees.

Anyway, days passed. If any of you familiar with coding, you already know that a simple program marks data on a map from a database should take at most a day or two. When I checked on Saturn's progress, I found out she had managed to... connect to our database? Kind of. I told her she needed to focus, otherwise I'd be forced to write the program myself and she'd be denied the right to be considered ""in the project"". I got ignored, then introduced to her blog.

Blogging isn't so hip in Turkey, but I should say she was dedicated. She squeezed a promise to read her blog out of me and I knew why it was so important the moment I finished reading. She was ""lonely, missing the satisfaction of pleasing a man."".. Extend that single sentence to about 30 blog posts and 20 pages. I decided I'd keep my distance, check on her in a couple days and then write the damn reporting software myself.

And yesterday.. Saturn visited my room, wearing something that accentuates her ""curves"".. She sat, we chatted a little and.. She started insulting the photos of my wife. ""Does your wife have an eating disorder?""... ""Sad, she could be really beautiful if she gained a bit of weight..""... ""I hope you never step on her accidentally, she's like a hobbit."" Mind you, my wife may be a bit short, 1.57m, but she's whip thin still with enormous ""assets"" - y'know what I mean. She's flat out gorgeous.

I was kind of getting pissed. I excused her, telling her ""I need full concentration for the next code block"" and stood up to get coffee and the truck hit me. Oh, not the truck, just Saturn deciding pressing me against the wall like in the movies is a good idea.. But in the movies the speed of pressing the significant other against the wall is less than 80kph.

My head literally bounced against the wall. I'm a pencil-neck geek, I coded my whole life. My chest muscles weren't developed to withstand the assault of half a tonne against them. You do know the smell, the smell of raw animal fat was assaulting my nostrils. I literally nearly blacked out while she whispered something about her capability of showing me what a true woman can do.

I pushed her away as her lips puckered and growled ""Leave!"".. It was about 10am. I sat back, completely confused, thinking of what I'd do. I was to leave to the headquarters about the project being completed next Monday anyway, so I decided I'd simply report the incident and be done. So I got back to my code.

And about 1pm, I got a phone call from the boss, asking me if I sexually assaulted the new intern in my room. I laughed, then laughed a bit more, then told him to remotely connect to our camera server and check my room for 10am-11am.. Yeah we have cameras. No they're not hidden - they're old fashioned huge cameras as part of the security system.

I decided against suing, I love my company and I do not want unnecessary attention. She got fired instantly. I'm planning to ensure she never gets a job ever again in my industry and my city.

Ranting about it and sharing a secret anonymously in the internet feels good. Forgive me about the loooong rant and have a nice day."
3qtvmr,175,2015-10-30,My fiance [30m] is telling me we have to break up if I [26f] have to move a short distance away to pursue a career,relationship41894198,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3qtvmr/my_fiance_30m_is_telling_me_we_have_to_break_up/,"Excuse spelling/grammar as I wrote this on my phone.

Some background info:

Me and my fiance have been together for around a year and a half. We met while were both in our second year of law school and we did a long distance relationship for the last year of law school since we lived in different states. When discussing the future and our plans to end the distance - one of us would have to move to the others' state and take the bar exam for that state. He ended up having multiple offers for post grad employment at different law firms. Two of them were in California, and one of them was in the city I lived. I wanted him to accept the offer at the place he thought he would be happiest and not just choose the firm where I was at. I didn't want him to resent coming to the city I was if he wasn't happy with the job. Also of note was that I was interested in working as a public criminal defense attorney and the nature of that job market means that offers for employment aren't made until after passing the bar exam. Thus, I did not have any definite job offers lined up while he had multiple offers for extremely well paying gigs (160k starting salary) at big law firms. I had made good connections during my internships and had a small network of classmates who were also in crim law, as well as my family and friends here - but I figured I could also find work in public defense where he had offers.

So he ended up accepting a job in Los Angeles and we made plans to move in together over the summer and study for the bar together. I took the bar in California and we moved in together and currently are awaiting bar results. 

I began feeling out the area for public defense jobs and learned very quickly that it was almost impossible to break into without connections and the last couple months I've had no luck even trying to get an interview. People I know that are familiar with the job climate here strongly suggested that I be open to working in the counties that were further away. These places had ~2 hour commutes but I figured if I could get a paid position (instead of volunteering for a while) then I could afford to rent a place closer by and then me and my fiance would be living around an hour apart. This would obviously mean that we wouldn't be sleeping in the same bed every night, etc.

It should also be noted that as part of me leaving my friends, family, and any job connections behind, my fiance would make more than enough money to support us both while I look for employment. He said I could even do pro bono work to get experience as a solo practitioner while trying to get in at a public agency. I should also state here that working indigent defense has been my dream since high school and it was the entire reason I went to law school. I have no desire to make money as a private practitioner or work in any other area of private law.

Tonight I brought up the possibility of working at these more remote counties and subsequently maybe living apart until I could get a job closer to his job. The first thing he said to me is that we might as well just break up. He was understandably upset at the prospect of living apart after having done long distance for 9 months. He explained that if he just couldn't do it anymore. I explained to him that my prospects of doing public defense in a closeby agency were becoming grim and if nothing panned out then I would really be screwing my career dream if I start out doing workers compensation claims or some other unrelated area of law. He just flat out said if I move to get a job then we are done, and basically left it as if the choice for him is involuntary so that if I decide to move for my job then I am picking my career over this relationship. I don't see it that way since I would like to figure out a way for us to remain together despite the distance, and an hour drive doesn't seem that far. He says that when I start working I'm going to be completely engrossed in my job since it is my passion and we will be stuck seeing each other only on weekends. He says that's how it was in his last relationship when she moved 45 minutes away. He thinks that if nothing in public defense pans out then he wants me to try working some other area of law first, or try working for a private criminal defense firm, or just fly solo and try running a practice on my own doing criminal defense or just work pro bono. What I really want though is to work for those who cannot afford attorneys and the way to do that as well as getting the training I need to really get a career started is working at a public defender's office.

I'm not sure what to do here. I really want this relationship to work but I also want my career. I feel like I gambled a lot by leaving my friends, family, and work connections to come here. Had I stayed put, I had a few offices I know I would have had a good chance working for, or at least volunteering for until jobs opened up. What really bothered me about this discussion is that my fiance threw in some quips about how I didn't really have much prospects in my home city since I had no offers at graduation. He basically cross examined me about my difficulty landing internships and some conflicts with supervisors and concluded that I wasn't really sacrificing anything regarding my career by coming to Los Angeles since my prospects at home weren't great. He also threw in how his coworkers thought it ""must be nice having someone support you while you chase your dream."" It really sucks because, contrary to his assertions, at least had connections and knew people back home. Here I don't know a single attorney in public defense yet, making it impossible for me to even know what the fuck is going on. I also don't have my school nearby to help me with making connections.

I told him when it comes down to it, if I got a paid offer from a nearby county and moved to accept it, knowing full well he will break up with me as a result, I will take it. He basically said that was proof I cared more about my career then him, but I really felt that me coming to Cali and trying to stay close by was a compromise. I thought he was being selfish by throwing that ultimatim - and really its him that would be deciding to end the relationship - not me. I want it to continue, I'm just not willing to give up my dream for it. I told him that if that's really his stance, and hes serious - then I suppose I shouldn't limit my search to nearby counties since he would be dumping me anyway. It all feels a bit controlling to me since I gave up a lot to come here, but now I'm being told I'm the selfish one for wanting to move out so I can get a job in the field I want.

I feel really bad that he has to support me while I try to get a job here, but at the same time that was kind of the agreement since I would likely be in a much better position to get work back home. Am I being unreasonable by refusing to accept working in a different area of law and moving out so I can at least pursue my dream career?

edit: Didn't know there would be so many lawyers - so some extra info. He's not actually working the hours you guys are describing because hes in IP litigation at a ""lifestyle"" firm. So his work week is standard 9-530/6. This can change when litigation ramps up but its not the hellish biglaw lifestyle of other sectors. My guess is the IP group is far more valuable and his education/skillset makes him indispensible to the firm (he had so many summer offers and multiple firm offers after 2L summer).

Him commuting likely won't work for the reasons people mentioned.

As for me, I graduated from a T30 with a 3.5. So, not an ivy league and not the top of class, but still a very good ranking school with good grades.

**tl;dr**: Moved to another state after LTR where my fiance got a job. Having a hard time finding work in the field I want to work in, suggest possibility of applying to areas further away and live an hour apart. Fiance thinks I'm choosing my career over him."

Since I didn't come from money, however, I had to find a way to make it in order to push through, and that meant putting the creative urge aside, invest in education, unpaid internships and eventually transform all of that into a career.

Luckily, it all worked out as planned, and I was safe, financially.

Now, when you're in a boring, corporate full-time job, eventually you will start thinking more and more about that early point in life, when you were set to do something completely different with your life, something you were so passionate about, but for various reasons (god-damn money), you ended up in a whole different mess. A world you now belong to, professionally, but perhaps not with your mind and heart.

Don't get me wrong: I've always ventured back into the creative world when I had a chance to. I make/write music and ended up in the iTunes charts, I had a book published, done voice-overs, and I've acted in strange startup ads.

I've even written a few TV pilots, and a feature—all unproduced and unrecognised of course. I say all that to show that I am more than willing to put in the work, any day of the year. 

---

So, for a while now, I've been trying to restart it all; to begin a new career, and to go back to the first step. The big dream is: to be involved with TV/film. Ideally, as close as possible to the job of a screenwriter. If that means being a script reader, assistant, etc. — I'm in, just let me be a part of it.

So over the past few weeks and months, I've been looking through industry jobs, and I realised that everyone expects *experience*. All right, I've been through that, a decade ago—so I get it, chicken and egg, gotta figure that one out all over again. Fine, interning it is then.

But most of the entry-level jobs won't even consider my CV, they think I'm fucking with them. I am not trying to sound like a snobby rich daddy's boy here (nowhere near rich)—I don't fear the work or starting back at the bottom, trust me—I just feel it may be wise to try and see whether there's a chance to get into the industry with other thirty-year-olds. My TV/film-relevant experience  says I'm like any other eighteen-year-old out there, I get that, but my character, education and professional work ethic says I'm thirty-one. Does that count, though? Do people care?

Has anyone else gotten in late? Is *this* late (I assume it is)? 

And most importantly: what (if anything) can I use from over a decade of being a (hopefully) nice-guy, self-starting professional, in order to break into this industry? You know, I'm not going to show up late, I won't even complain about the money, they won't find me stoned and passed out in the archive room, and I have an opinion on things if people ask me, and I keep it to myself if they don't. I do what is asked of me, and I try to be exceptionally good at it. 

If you have any piece of advice, please, I beg you to speak. If you think I don't deserve it, having already had my chance in a different world, that's fine as well, I kind of understand.

Bonus question: if you're located in the UK/London and work in film, I'd love to hear your take on how things work here? I am new to the industry, and I am trying hard to map it all out right now. But most of the BBC/Channel4/etc. things are either geared towards &lt; twenty-year-olds or experienced professionals. I'm participating in the Writersroom things, and other opportunities, but it's all happening from here, through my computer, in my quiet flat."
3quac8,21,2015-10-30,"Who are some characters that grew on you, and some that fallen from your favor?",technicalityNDBO,Earwolf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Earwolf/comments/3quac8/who_are_some_characters_that_grew_on_you_and_some/,"Maybe it's just me, but for me I didn't care much for Victor &amp; Tiny at first.  Traci Reardon I don't think was all that spectacular on her first appearance until she started fleshing out her weird backstory.  I know I'm not alone (not being from California), but I didn't initially realize that Huell Howser was an impression of someone at first.  But once I discovered that and watched some youtube footage of California Gold, I laughed retroactively for hours.  Shelly Driftwood grew on me a bit.  Gino the Intern didn't really do anything for me when I first heard him either.  I thought his schtick was just being a Long Island guy, but he ended up being one of my top 3 favorites.

I'm sad to say that Marissa Wompler has gotten a bit tiresome for me.  Even though I love Jess St. Clair &amp; Lennon Parham, it was probably around the time that Listler started regularly accompanying her.  Alan Thicke started to get annoying when Paul latched on a little too tightly to the ""eeuuuurp"" sound."
3qucfa,2,2015-10-30,Am i screwed?,NoCrbPls,UKJobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKJobs/comments/3qucfa/am_i_screwed/,"Hi everyone.

I am currently a first year economics student at a target school (for investment banking). I am on top of my studies and I've joined most finance related societies and attend most career/networking events.

However, I have a major set back. I am from a European country in which I was stupid enough to get a criminal record for being under the influence of narcotics (no possession). For this I received a fine and did not have to go to court (almost like a caution in the UK). This will stay on my record for the next 5 years after which it will be nearly impossible for anyone to find out. However, I finish my undergrad in 3 years and during these 3 years I want to do some internships. 

I know my conviction will not show up on an CRB checks but most banks/accounting firms will most likely ask for a copy of my home country's criminal record. And when they see it I am sure they will decline my offer (since the number of applicants is so extremely high why would they want to hire a convict?).

I guess I am just looking for some advice on how to use my time in the best way I possibly can given my situation. Should I just focus  on my grades and skip interning and then do a 2 year masters? Because once I finish my MSc my record would be clean.

What would you guys suggest?

Thanks in advance."
3qufqg,6,2015-10-30,My notes on the CEOC City Council forum (Oct. 29),rspeer,CambridgeMA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CambridgeMA/comments/3qufqg/my_notes_on_the_ceoc_city_council_forum_oct_29/,"The format of this evening was interesting. Three candidates at a time would be selected, and they would be given a very specific question by the moderators from the CEOC. After ten minutes, three other candidates could volunteer a brief response.

The moderators made it clear that they'd be making people stick to the topic. They held the forum for a reason, and it wasn't to hear 18 stump speeches. The CEOC was asking difficult questions that didn't necessarily fit with people's platforms. I appreciated this. We know where they stand in general by now, let's hear about some difficult issues.

## Over-income families in public housing

Kelley, Mello, and Devereux: There was an investigative report on over-income families in public housing -- families who once qualified for public housing, but are staying there after their income increases. ""There has to be a pathway out"", but the market out there doesn't support them. What should happen? Brainstorm what the city should do.

* **Kelley**: The job market is volatile. Someone who's making lots of money right now might not be next year. I wouldn't kick anyone out, I'd give them assistance looking at their options. ... Don't push people out, but do raise their rent gradually, up to market price. But jobs are volatile.
* **Mello**: They should be eased out. No subsidies for people who can afford higher rent. Anywhere else, if you don't pay the rent, you leave. Grown children with jobs should take care of themselves instead of living off of their parents. People at the bottom need that housing too. ... The only consideration I'd make is for age. It's difficult for the elderly to relocate.
* **Devereux**: Working people in their 20s would *prefer* to live independently, I'm sure, but they don't have anywhere to go. We need to structure housing benefits to incentivize families to earn more, not penalize it. ... In this city, even six figures of income can still be income insecurity.

Responses:

* **Minka**: We should be talking about Cambridge's home-ownership program. We should push this program more. Help people become homeowners, with the trade-off of limiting their equity. Then we won't be talking about whether we need to kick them out.
* **Davidson**: 2-3 bedroom units are too scarce, and if we supported non-profit developers, they would build affordable ones.
* **Carlone**: Follow the example of NYC. Buildings with 1/3 market rate, 1/3 subsidized, 1/3 low-income units. Let people stay in the building but bump them to less-subsidized rates.


## Who are the poor and what should we do for them?

Waite, Simmons, and Levy: 8.2% of Cambridge households experience deep poverty, as in living on less than $5 per person per day. Who would you say these people are [this part sounded like a quiz]? How do they survive? What would you do for them?

* **Simmons**: Some of them are language minorities and women-headed households. The City Council put money aside for job training, and voted for a living wage for city workers. We just closed the loophole that let people misclassify their employees as contractors and not pay them a living wage.
* **Levy**: Minorities. They need training. MIT and Harvard should participate. The poor survive because their ethnic communities provide for each other. We should do that as a city. But first we have to change our form of government. Why haven't we ended poverty yet?
* **Waite**: I'm currently trying to start a business. More people should do that. Support the Possible Project.

Responses:

* **Benzan**: The city has many types of shelters and subsidized housing. We should have more sci/tech workforce training. We should also give college graduates an opportunity to live with their parents for a few years more [I didn't catch what financial disincentive he was proposing to fix, but it might have been the one Mello was talking about].
* **McGovern**: I chaired the city's recent report on income insecurity. Federally, if you make over $11K/year you're not poor. Right? No, in Cambridge a single person needs $51K/year. So we looked at what we need to do to address *Cambridge* poverty. Minimum wage increases. Job training. Food pantries.
* **Connolly**: Universal affordable child care. Municipal broadband. Free Internet for the poor.


## What qualifies as a housing emergency?

Mahoney, Toomey, and Cheung: The Cambridge Housing Authority declared a housing emergency when the rents at Harding St were increased and people were displaced. The definition of a housing emergency is inconsistent. Are housing emergencies real or people gaming the system? Who do you help first?

* **Toomey**: Housing is the most important issue in this election. I never met any resident who's gaming the system. But I have met people who are talking about affordable housing and then voting against 50 units of affordable housing at Mass and Main because they didn't get everything they wanted.
* **Mahoney**: Developers are taking over our city. We have to do something. If someone sends you a letter offering you a huge amount of money for your house, *tear it up*.
* **Cheung**: The premise of this question is all wrong. ""Gaming the system"" feeds into divisive rhetoric. When you ask who you help first, you're talking like a villain from that superhero movie. Batman. Superman. The Matrix. Dangling multiple people over the edge of a bridge and asking who you save, and then because the hero is a superhero with super speed they save everyone. [Note: he's referring to Spider-Man.] We're not superheroes. But we do what we can, with compassion. Don't just think about the future, build the future.

**Moderator**: I asked the question this way because people who set these policies really *do* worry about people gaming the system.

* **Cheung**: The problem is that there's not enough space for *any* of the categories. We need empty housing units so there's someplace for people to move to. We need to build them.
* **Toomey**: The fact that a housing emergency puts you into a *lottery* reveals the scope of the problem.
* **Mahoney**: We're all compassionate. But people should have to prove their income [referring back to the first question].

Responses:

* **Simmons**: It's particularly tough because right now the CHA is rehabilitating properties, so there's fewer available. We give people vouchers and the vouchers still don't cover the difference between market rate and affordability. When people are driven out of Cambridge, we should let them use opportunities as if they were still Cambridge residents for 2-5 years. Residents are also confused at the separate processes from the city and the CHA, and we should reconcile and streamline them.
* **Mazen**: Housing equality is a sinking ship. Everyone brags about plugging one hole while three more spring up. I take offense at Cheung talking about empty units. He just wants you to buy into his worldview. We need to know who these empty units are displacing.
* **Carlone**: The city has been focused on commercial development for too long. Now we need to focus on social development. We have the money to do it now. 1/3 market rate.


## Children's savings accounts, plus assorted interjections

Williamson, Minka, Carlone: Children benefit when the government opens a college savings account in their name. Should we be doing this? Who would the stakeholders be?

* **Minka**: Well, right now, we start a bit late, but 14- to 18-year-olds in the Mayor's program get bank accounts, and this helps with financial literacy.
* **Moderator**: No they don't. They get introduced to banks and that's all.
* **Minka**: Well, then, they *should* get bank accounts.
* **Williamson**: Commercial developers hurt us all in the name of affordable housing. If it's the only way, fine, let's sell the city to Donald Trump. Otherwise--
* **Moderator**: You're not answering the question.
* **Williamson**: Don't interrupt me. I know that you personally donate to these other candidates.
* **Audience**: boooooooo
* **Moderator**: There are rules in this forum. Answer the question or stop talking.
* **Williamson**: I got here late! Nobody told me the rules! I thought an intro to my platform would be reasonable!
* **Moderator**: Shut up. Carlone?
* **Williamson**: You can't silence me!
* **Carlone**: It makes a huge difference in children's lives when they have the *expectation* of going to college. I saw a public school where a rich benefactor promised he would make sure every student could go to college. It turned those children's lives around. We can't do this everywhere but we need more programs like this.
* **Moderator**: So who would you say are the stakeholders?
* **Minka**: Children.
* **Moderator** (exasperated that people are missing the point of her question): I mean, for example, banks. Who are the people who would make this program happen?
* **Minka**: Yes, banks should be involved, but we need to avoid biased education. The Margaret Fuller House [a historic house in Area Four that now provides services for immigrants and the poor] would be a good choice.
* **Williamson**: I don't like the word ""stakeholder"". But credit unions should be involved.
* **Carlone**: Socially-minded banks such as Eastern Bank.

Responses:

* **Waite**: If we spent $3.3 million per year, we could invest $500/year in every child. Give them guidance from the city. Counseling for how to start a business. That money isn't much but it could be worth a lot if it's invested in stocks and bonds.
* (someone in the audience): Sometimes!
* **Devereux**: Our educational institutions and corporations should participate.
* **Kelley**: $500 per child per year is nothing compared to the school budget. It won't solve the problem but it can build hope.


## Condo conversion ordinance

McGovern, Davidson, Benzan: From 1970 to 2008 over 10,000 units were converted to condos. I'd talk about what's happened since 2008 but the data isn't published. The average sale price of a condo now is $500,000. Does Cambridge need an ordinance against houses being converted to condos, separate from the one that exists in state law? A moratorium on conversions?

* **McGovern**: The largest price increase happened after we tried rent control. We should look at a local condo ordinance that makes sure there's a percentage for affordable housing. No moratorium. A moratorium means you're closing off options and I never close off options.
* **Benzan**: [referring to Williamson's complaint] When an anti-poverty group donates to your campaign, it means you're doing something *right*. We shouldn't be campaigning with personal attacks. And, you know, we get these MIT graduates moving in who think they know how to run the city... opening up stupid businesses in Central Square...
* **Moderator**: This is inappropriate.
* **Davidson**: I'm a proud MIT graduate, and yes we need a local ordinance against condos. We need an algorithm to create opportunity. We can't keep developing with special interest dollars. We need to leverage our cultural and intellectual capacity.
* **McGovern**: We need to do something about speculation. We need some development but there *are* evil developers. They harass residents. They don't keep their promises.
* **Connolly**: Yes, we need an ordinance. The council rejected such an ordinance in 2000. I think some of these city councillors were here then. Boston and Somerville have done it.
* **Devereux**: There's a candidate here who took donations from the Harding St. developer who threw everyone out.

(Moderator cuts off further responses)


## Domestic violence

Moree, Mazen, Connolly: Domestic violence remains steady year after year. What can we do for victims of domestic violence? Nobody *wants* to live in a shelter. What role should we play in preventing DV?

* **Moree** (out of his depth): It takes a community to stop domestic violence. Education. Stop drinking. Experts.
* **Connolly**: When Marjorie Decker was a city councillor she raised awareness. Maybe it doesn't help me to say this, but we need more women on the council.
* **Mazen**: We're duplicating effort to combat domestic violence right now. There's a lack of coherent messaging from the city. I asked the city manager if he had the power to draw down a program that was redundant and he said no. We need to throw out our entire budget every 5-10 years and start from zero.

Responses:

* **Benzan**: Domestic violence has its roots in human trafficking and mass incarceration.
* **McGovern**: The city is taking this on, with transitional housing and shelters, but people have nowhere to go. We need more education on domestic violence, for children and adults.
* **Simmons**: Support programs. Education. Also the City Council needs to be role models. When a man is rude to a woman in public, *James*, that's domestic violence.


## Final statements

* **Williamson**: I yelled at Elaine [the moderator] because she was interrupting. I was being bullied. Elaine *bullies* people.
* **Waite**: Micro-aggressions add up to domestic violence. We need community centers. We need to be understanding of who we're keeping in Cambridge. We need a system of direct donations to the homeless where you can see the effect you're having on their lives.
* **Minka**: My platform is about health. That includes economic health.
* **Toomey**: Opiate addiction.
* **Simmons**: Comprehensive housing plan. Inclusionary zoning.
* **Moree**: Opportunities. Internships. Build more housing. Build affordable housing. I love all you beautiful women.
* **Mello**: Double the affordable housing trust, and do it with *taxes*. I said it. Not surtaxes. We can find the money.
* **McGovern**: The most important thing is, how do we come together after Tuesday? We need to collaborate, especially in times of disagreement. When we dig in to our own positions, nobody wins and the vulnerable suffer.
* **Mazen**: I came from a middle class family, but now I'm poor. I have roommates. I'm in this city by the skin of my teeth.
* **Mahoney**: Condos are evil.
* **Levy**: The City Council never solves anything. Vote for me as a referendum on replacing our system of government.
* **Kelley**: If the Council is still fighting itself when winter comes around, people will die.
* **Devereux**: It takes time to understand all the issues, so I would be a councillor as a full-time job.
* **Davidson**: Community. Equitable development.
* **Connolly**: I will lead on affordable housing. There's a difference of perspective. I oppose luxury housing, like Carlone and Mazen.
* **Cheung**: People may disagree about some things but we share the same goals. I have a lot to say but I'll let my flyer speak for me.
* **Carlone**: I want your *only* vote. We are a wealthy city. Who do we want to be? Also, pre-K from ages 2 to 5.
* **Benzan**: Prepare our young people. Connect them to the economy. I think of development in terms of people. Fight opiate addiction.

3qumq4,0,2015-10-30,Chance of Getting Offer After Internship,PraiseKingYeezus,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/3qumq4/chance_of_getting_offer_after_internship/,"I was wondering what the chances are of getting a full time offer after an internship at a big 4. I know that it's going to vary based on office, but do they usually extend an offer as long as you aren't a douchebag/inept?"
3qup39,2,2015-10-30,"[Side Project] A Youtube Channel Dedicated to Making Animated Videos about Self-improvement, Entrepreneurship and Seduction Books.",happydusts,SideProject,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/3qup39/side_project_a_youtube_channel_dedicated_to/,"First question: Can we consider a Youtube channel a startup? For sure, anything that brings value to people and generate profit (even when it's low) is a startup.

Okey, so what's my story?
In 2010, after graduating high school, I was very passionate about computers. I started to have this huge drive to learn anything and everything, about how web apps are made, how web pages are designed etc.. So I decided to get into an IT university.

Right on my first day of university, I remember in my very first class, I was learning about the programing language C, and we were writing our very first line of code: printf(). And nobody in the class knew that day how happy I was. I felt ecstatic. No BS!

Years later (in my third year), I was having a great reputation in class, and I was the person people would turn to whenever they were stuck at coding. I was constantly ranked 2nd or 3rd at class, which **was** for me a big deal, after being ranked the 2nd last in class several times back in high school.

So I got good at coding and I started to make personal projects for fun. But it was nothing serious. Or sometimes I would get an idea, I would think I'm the only person with this idea, I would remember how many people live on earth, I would search on google and **Boom**, people thought about it years ago. lol

Fast foward to my final year (the 5th), I started to get interested in Books. Books about self-development, entrepreneurship, seduction, gaining power and influencing people. I was great at coding but poor in those areas. And I saw books as the only solution to improve.

During that year, in the second semester, I had to take a 6 months internship as part of the university curriculum, and then look for a job after.

Right on my first day of internship, I felt like if I spent another second on coding, I'll be only wasting my time, so instead I devoted my whole time to reading. I would digest book after book and at the end I would end up with some valuable ideas, that I would eventually share and discuss with friends.

Those ideas were so valuable, yet few people knew them, so I said why not share them with everybody? And instead of discussing them only with few people, I could share them with everybody on the Internet: Youtube.

3 months spent of that internship and I decided to finally start sharing my thoughts on Youtube. So I devoted my whole free time to make videos, where I would explain the most important ideas from a specific 
book and eventually put them on Youtube for people to learn from and discuss.

So meanwhile I'm working in an IT Firm, while making Youtube videos on my free time, which I enjoy doing. But for the long term goal, I'm planing to make use of my IT skills and build an interesting web app and see how it goes.

3qvftj,12,2015-10-30,Where do you find mentors?,pretty-yin,TrollDevelopers,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrollDevelopers/comments/3qvftj/where_do_you_find_mentors/,"Rant ahead.

Hey all, a couple years back I entered the field with no knowledge what-so-ever. I was placed in an intern program to be taught coding (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) from the bottom up so I could eventually work full time on contracts or projects. 
Unfortunately, I was the only woman in that cohort of interns and our trainer/manager simply refused to help me learn. While I hesitate to immediately assume his reasoning was biased by my gender, it certainly came across that way. I was left on my own to learn while other interns were given time, attention, and explanations for the entire length of our internships there. 
Afterwards I was placed on a contract that seemed great, but ultimately required little-to-no actual coding and I feel like what skills I had rusted out.
So the contract has ended and I'm seriously feeling lost. I had the time to load up CodeWars and started playing around, but I feel like there are huge gaps in my understanding of basic, fundational concepts. I'm missing something but the tutorials online aren't helping me bridge the gap between example and actual code. I also feel like I have very few places to turn to seek help.

That leads me to the title. Where have you found mentors? Have you struggled with basic concepts after a point you ""should"" know them, and how did you get past it?"
3qvjr3,1,2015-10-30,"Need advice on 'getting back to it,' burning out, pressure, and feeling lost.",Epershand,writing,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/3qvjr3/need_advice_on_getting_back_to_it_burning_out/,"I hope this is the right subreddit for this. I was browsing the other writing communities, but this sub has the biggest audience and I'd like as much input as possible.

**TL;DR:** After years of working in an unpaid internship position editing for a small agency, and still failing to ""hit it big"" (massively disappointing my parents), I literally stopped writing. It's been a little over three years and I still think about writing *every damn day*. How do I recapture my love of writing when I am so scared of failing again? 

**Summarized background:** I discovered my love of writing very early, while I was still in middle school. My parents were supportive to say the least, so much so that my father built up my ego with how I was going to be in Oprah's Book Club and be rich and famous one day like J.K Rowling. I'm pretty sure this warped my definition of 'success,' but I was very young and had no idea what I was doing. In fact, he still insists I will be rich and famous off my writing, and tries to guilt into writing every time I talk to him. He insists that, when he's old, the only way he's going to be able to survive is off my massive amounts of wealth that will come from my prize-winning writing career. 

Getting back to it, I majored in Creative Writing in college, which I very much enjoyed, and landed an unpaid internship (required for a class) with a literary agency in my area. It was fantastic work; I loved it. I discovered my passion for editing other people's MS was just as fierce as my passion for my own writing.

I languished in that job for much longer than I should have. This was right at the economic downturn of 2012, and the 'commission' I received for editing four full-length novels over years of work ended up at about 75$.

The one bright star that came from that job was a 50/50 re-write split of one of my boss' client's works. He had written this shamble of a novel that had this great spark hidden inside of it. I tore that thing to pieces and built it up again. It's been finished for a couple of years now but my old boss and her client don't seem interested in it at all, even though I know it's a fun piece of fiction.

After months of getting the run-around, I stopped emailing her. It was around that time, after trying to get my own manuscripts off the ground with no success, that another client of hers told me, ""if you can live without writing, do it. It's easier and less painful that way"".  So I did. It felt like I had done *so much* for *so long* without any reward or anything to show for it. I *know* that's not the point of writing, but I was so *tired*. I felt like I had let everyone down, worked so hard, sapped all my creative juices, and had nothing left to give. 

This was three years ago.

I still think about writing every day of my life. I think about my characters stuck frozen in time with no resolution. I don't really feel a spark of inspiration, but I know writing is what I am good at, and I feel like I'm wasting my life and my potential. But now I'm so rusty... can I ever retain what I once had? The magic I once felt?

I'm afraid. I'm terrified that I'll put in another three years of work-- another *thirty* years of work-- and have accomplished nothing.

I don't know if I just need to get over myself, get a therapist, or what, but I need advice for sure. "
3qvlgb,2,2015-10-30,I'm a college sophomore and I'm not really sure what the right path for me is. Any advice?,BastardMan32,Screenwriting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/3qvlgb/im_a_college_sophomore_and_im_not_really_sure/,"I'm a film major at a state school that has a pretty decent film program. It's a very technical school and most people that go here don't have a difficult time finding freelance work as grips/gaffers and other such jobs when they graduate. They also have an option that if your GPA is at least a 3.0 and you have a strong enough portfolio, they'll help you find internships out in LA. I think they said usually only 1 or 2 people get hired a year, though. Right now my GPA is around a 3.9 and I think I could keep it in that range by the time I graduate. 

I was also thinking that I could try transferring to NYU because it's not too far away and they have a much stronger film program. Though, I read someone on here say they regret going there because they had a significant debt to pay off and they couldn't take any low-paying or free internships once they graduated. When I graduate from this state school I'll probably be debt free or close to it since my dad's  nice enough to pay it off for me. With NYU, though, I’ll definitely have to take out loans. It might be around $40k a year if they give me a ton of grants, and I guess that’s not entirely impossible to pay off throughout the course of my life. I’m just not sure if it’d be worth it. 

I could also try switching my major to computer science or something like that, and hopefully have a steady paying job that’ll also give me enough free time to read and  write after work. I'm afraid that if I switch to computer science I won't have any free time to write while in college and I'll just be setting myself back for the sake of playing it safe.

I'm motivated enough to write and read every single day, and as a film major, I have a decent amount of free time to do this. I’m also considering double majoring in Literature. I don’t really think it’ll help me find a job, but I think it’ll definitely help as a writer. 

My plan as it stands is to spend the next couple of years at this state school writing and producing a short film a semester, and see if they get any traction from festivals. If not, they’d at least help build my portfolio for that internship. I’m not really sure what to do, and any of these options (and any option I have yet to think of) are still viable. Thanks for taking the time to read, and any advice would be much appreciated.

3qvvo6,7,2015-10-30,Sublease Apartment Scam..?,hannahprettyinpunk,Scams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/3qvvo6/sublease_apartment_scam/,"I'm desperate to sublease my apartment because I'm leaving next month for an internship. I posted an ad on craigslist that included my cell number so people could text me. A girl texts me, sends me her email and asks me to email her the details.


By typing that, I just realized I no longer have the ""safe"" email or whatever craigslist does to hide your email. She now has my student email, which I don't think is a huge deal since obviously she knows where my university is because it's in the add, and it doesn't include my full name. But here's our interaction...



Me: Hello! So when you apply to live here, if you have a cosigner you do not have to pay a deposit. If you do not have a cosigner, they require one months rent up front ($474), but they said they can negotiate if you have other rental experience. If you have pets, it's a $350 registration fee up front. I'll go ahead and pay all of December and I'm planning on having everything out by Dec. 12. I just found out when I called that I have to pay $250 to get out of my lease, so I don't think I'll be able to pay the half of January like I said in my post. So to move in up front with a co signer and no pets I'm pretty sure you would just pay for the month of January by January 5th. Rent is always due no later than the fifth of each month.    



Her:  I'm so glad to hear from you quick, I'm interested in renting the
room. My name is Rosena J[blocking out her last name] i was born in France (Paris) i speak
both French &amp; English, am single, fun, loving, clean, loyal and

i'll loved to call you but here is a remote area calls are very hard
to go through, please send me some picture of the room because i will
not be able to come over and check on it before renting.

  Please tell me little about yourself...if you are a
student?,working?, married or single?, if there is a garage or parking

you can  hold on the place prior my arrival... Thanks for your

The weird thing is, all of this happened within the last 30 minutes. My email is showing I sent it at 1:08, which is not true, and it says she also replied at 1:08. It's just weirdly worded, I told her how much it would cost, she replied the exact same minute (it could also be a copy and paste but I was really specific so she shouldn't have needed further clarification of the cost) and now the times are messed up on my email.

Trump says guest workers are decimating the US Tech workforce. Many agree. There are people looking into what happened with the Disney, Microsoft, intel, HP layoffs, etc. 

Rubio stood up on that stage and basically said the US isn’t producing enough qualified STEM workers.

** This is not a case of enough STEM students, but unrealistic employers**

I dislike Intel because of a few of their policies and H1B lobbying. So I’m going to pick on them. I have a few complaints against Intel lobbying for more visas:

1.)	They only want the best and brightest when it comes to employees in the US. This can be seen in the fact that in the US, GPA is an employment equipment. But, if you look at their Jobs India page, academic performance is not listed as a requirement.

2.)	 Moving on to job search. Selecting “United States”, “Engineering”, and “College Graduate” (today you get 247 jobs). In the past 10 days, they have posted 34 “college grad” jobs. Many required at least 6 months of experience. Which is an internship. I didn’t include those. Only 1 year and up. But, how is a recent grad supposed to qualify for these jobs? Some of them have ridiculous (in number and/or item) requirements.

Excluding the one I’m letting slide (14/34), 41% of these requisitions are not for **RECENT GRADS**

Before you say “Well maybe they are displaced” or some BS. They don’t show up in experienced candidate searches. I already looked.

3qw1oe,21,2015-10-30,"SPOOoooOOOooOOKY Deal Fellas!! New ""Forgotten and Stumbled Upon"" Available!!!! AND AT LOW PRICES Thanks to Ol' D to the B!!!!",double_barrel_whisky,rcigarsbattlezone,https://www.reddit.com/r/rcigarsbattlezone/comments/3qw1oe/spooooooooooooky_deal_fellas_new_forgotten_and/,"BOO!!!

Ha ha fellas!!! I'm not a ghost!! It's your old pal d to the b to the double-fuckin-u, gents!!!! 

Here with another AMAZING opportunity. dubbie bubbie coming through again for you fellas because I care!!!

So as you all may know, I am kind of a big deal in the cigar world. I don't want to brag, but a lot of people respect my opinion and they sometimes allow me access to their stock of ~~overruns and seconds~~ top shelf cigars that they for some reason don't want to slap bands on and sell. 

Their mistake is my overcharging opportunity, AMIRITE BOYS?!?!? (And LADIES!! Luv u ladies!!!!!!!!!!!)

So I come to you stupid consumers, with an excellent buying opportunity. These cigars have ~~sat on shelves for years since they are too shitty to sell~~ been aging for over a half decade, patiently awaiting their time to shine as ~~unbanded seconds~~ rare aged magical tobacco wands of amaze balls, awaiting overhyped reviews due artificially inflated demand as a result of planned scarcity. This brings a tear to Jonathan Drew's eye. 

ANYWAY I DIGRESS fellas. I get wrapped up in the excitement of fucking you with my marketing dick. I offer to you these rare, one of a kind, totally not re-releases of regular production cigars that we couldn't sell. 

We are offering the following in this forgotten and stumbled upon release:

- Turd Furgeson- A piggy-esque vitola that announces, nay, screams its presence via an intense barnyard room note. It also comes wearing a big hat (and so does old bubbie, AMIRITE FELLAS!!!). 

- GLITTERTITS - A beautiful Connecticut Broadleaf wrapper with sparkling mineral deposits along the length of the cigar. Each under-filled masterpiece has two plugs of tobacco along the length of the cigar, reminiscent of a fine pair of chestnuts and foreshadowing an uneven burn and terrible cigar experience. 

- Trump Stump - This veiny petit double robusto comes adorned with a pigtail cap fanned from the back of the cigar to the front with a slight list towards the left. All glamour and no substance, this tastes like all your childhood hopes and dreams crammed into a pill, crushed, liquefied and injected between your toes in an Atlantic City public bathroom. (By the way fellas- my drunk intern came up with the ""TRUMP STUMP"" name. Fucking natch.  Kid's got a fucking gift. DONT HIDE THAT GIFT IN A BUSHEL BASKET.)

Aren't these exciting? I'm at half mast thinking about these amazing cigars. A less enterprising individual would sell these for $200 a bundle. IF these were released previously, they would have commanded $8 a stick.  But now, 8 years later... including inflation... a dollar per year for aging... carry the one... pull the wool over the consumer's eyes... and ODB is prepared to offer 10 packs in soft packaging (spare no expense!) for $160 each plus $10 for shipping/handling/processing.  I DONT KNOW HOW I CAN DO THIS FELLAS, but I do it because I LOVE YOU GUYS.  YOURE the BEST, and I want to reward you with premium cigars at ROCK BOTTOM prices.  My cats just won't eat this week. 

And since I love the community here (SO MANY GREAT AOTM OPTIONS!!!! PEEP MY YOUTUBE!! HAHA!!!) I'm prepared to offer sampler packs (one of each) for $57.50 shipped. 

Been a trip fellas!!!! I'll keep my eyes peeled for more great forgotten treasures and give you all first dibs (along with CATS, OLH and the weird shitty cigarbid forum). 

Love the ladies!! Let me know if you want to buy some of my treasure cigars!!! I accept PayPal, Google wallet, or tit and dick pics (LOL). Seriously though - LET me know if you are INTERESTED.  Specifically those of you who JUST bought a BUNCH of cigars and BLEW your budget! These will go quick, so I will GLADLY hold onto them until you get paid in two weeks.  DUBBIE cares about his customers!!!! 

And hey, I maaaayyyyy just BOOOOOM someone!!!! HAHA!! Watch your backs, fellas!! (And ladies!!!)"

3qwgzk,3,2015-10-30,My [23/M] girlfriend [22/F] randomly dumps during middle portion of LDR (8 months),TW3857,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3qwgzk/my_23m_girlfriend_22f_randomly_dumps_during/,"So back story: met this girl during senior year at university. I was initially against dating her, just because I didn't care for commitment and I knew she wanted more (started as FWB last September). Eventually we started hanging out for more than just sex, then eating dinner. We kinda realized at that point, 'Now we're in a relationship.'


Things went great. Every day waking up beside her just made everything in my life better. For the first time, I felt truly happy with what was going on in my life. We laughed, saw movies, drove to cities, cooked. It was all so amazing. Until this summer.


We graduated, she was off to another country for an internship at the beginning of september, and I was on the job search. Things got serious for us fast (moved in together), and we decided we wanted to start a life together. It's been an unusual struggle for me to find work in an area where she will be able to find work. I always tried to stay positive and not put any of my stress in the search on her. In the mean time, I've been working for my father. 


She left for another country for an internship that would further her career when she gets back. I remember multiple nights of me being the one hurt that she was leaving, she would console me and say it will be fine, no need to worry, and we'll talk every day and make it through because we love each other.


First two weeks were brutal. We argued quite a bit. Her version of communication was texting everyday. She's not big into phone calls. And while I'm not too, it'd be nice to hear her voice. I visit her family often and they agree: they barely hear from her herself. That I'm the only person she talks to everyday. They'll even ask me how she's doing when I see them.


Since then, (mid sept to now), things have been going great. Although we didn't call a lot, we'd try Skype sex couple times a week/sexting, and text as much as possible. I really was happy doing my own thing while she was doing hers, yet we were still making it work.


I got a call for an interview near where she wanted to work when she gets back. I've had some bad luck on some, so I kinda let it out and tell her I'm nervous and scared I'm going nowhere. She tells me that I am perfectly fine, but that I should see someone for my anxiety, and I say ""I'm just scared, it feels like I'm losing everything"". She responds with ""you're not losing me"".


She calls a half hour later crying. She goes 'I can't do this anymore. We need a break. We have lost the passion' Out of shock, I start yelling and crying, probably not best. I'm happy! I thought this was going great! I definitely didn't call her names, tried as hard to be civil as possible. Just kept asking why. why? Why all the sudden? Why are you doing this? 'I can't explain it. It's just a feeling. I'm so sorry'. She's also said You're different'. Which honestly blew me away. But she never gave me a straight answer. But the biggest one was 'I'm not sure if I love you anymore' So, fuck, I give her space. We argued about the duration. She would say she would call in a week, month, or when she gets home in march. All depended on what point of the argument we were at..


I rock one of the interviews. Feel super solid. Total great cover though because I am absolutely broken hearted by this. The day before we were talking about the bullshit of configuring holidays when she got home! How we'll have our kids do this and that with family blah blah. We were always talking about the future, then she drops the bomb.


My best friend keeps telling me 'she was a nice girl but you can do better'. My father says 'fuck her for doing it at such a selfish time (as I'm heading to an interview)'


HER best friend says 'it's the distance. I know she deeply cares about you. Give her space to miss you. Just a couple days max'. So I did for a couple days. She said I should talk to her tomorrow and tell her I don't want space, that I'm going to work on me and I want her in my life. Well, I decided to do it last night because I had work today and I'm not going to be a mess during work.


I call her (she's 7 hours ahead so roughly 10 pm). You can hear people in the background, and she may have been drinking. She sounded emotionless. 'I just can't do this right now, okay? I'm sorry.' 'But why?' 'I just need to do this for me'. So we go back to texting and I ask her how long the break and she says 'At least till I get home'. I said is there anything you want to say before I let you go and she told me good luck and that I'll be amazing at what I hope is my new job.


I instantly blocked every form of contact with her. Deleted all her pictures on my phone. Untagged myself in every graduation photo with her. I am a mess. How a girl who fought so hard for me (tried for a couple months to date me, I actually turned her down to her fall formal dance), walk away so easily 9 months later? 


One promise I made to her before she left was that no matter what happens, that I will be at the airport when she lands on March 1st. Her friend is convinced that deep down she would still want that. I want to fight for her so bad. But I'm getting advice from a couple people who might be too close to the relationship/people to make a good judgement call. I feel like such a sappy person in re-reading this but fuck. 


How long do I let this break slide? Is it an official breakup? Should I be there when she gets home? Like I said, I feel like shit about this, mostly from the shock. Also, her grandfather is dying and she has no idea (her mom told me not to tell her, which is fucked; her mom is a whole other story..). She may have to come home earlier due to the funeral and I'm worried about how she's going to react. 


Advice?


tl;dr girlfriend of 8 months dumps me (asks for a break till she's home from another country in March) out of the blue, trying to determine if it actually is a break, what to do if it is, or it's a breakup. If it's a breakup, is it because of the distance, or just things aren't working out and how I should go about moving on (prefer getting her back)"
3qws0r,14,2015-10-30,"I [29F] wanted to stay on good terms with my ex[23 M] of 5 months, but I think I screwed that up.",cephalopodstandard,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3qws0r/i_29f_wanted_to_stay_on_good_terms_with_my_ex23_m/,"I posted about this topic in another subreddit before, thinking I didn't want advice or any emotional support, but I've since deleted it and changed my mind about the wanting advice bit. It's a long story, and I'm sorry for that, but I'm puzzled about some things and while I really just want to stay on good terms with this guy, I'm worried it's impossible at this point.

I did a summer internship in another state and while I was there I became romantically involved with another intern (ex). Things got intense fast. We spent all our spare time and, with a few exceptions, every night together, and we went out on several dates.

From the start he was saying he wanted something serious, not a summer fling, and that he felt different for me than any girl he'd ever been with before. He told his family about us, he was planning for me to come out and visit him, planning to come out and visit me, and a month in told me he loved me. Even though I felt the same, I didn't say it back, for several reasons. 

He was different to me. I had never been in love before and I'd never gone far sexually or emotionally with another guy before. Before I met him, I was almost convinced I might be asexual, I had almost zero interest in sex, until him. Being with him, it all felt right, comfortable, like I belonged with him. He was young, and he'd been in love a few times before, and he warned me that he did get attached easily (I *don't* get attached easily) so I took that to mean I couldn't trust him to feel this way to the end of summer.

Except, we stayed together through the summer, and I felt increasingly confident about us. His internship ended before mine and a couple days before he left, we had the ""what happens now"" talk. He told me he didn't want to continue. I was upset, but I'd been prepared for it, and I told him that it was okay, I let him know that it was not what I wanted but I'm okay with it. 

I think that made him feel guilty, so he started trying to justify his decision by listing off all of my ""flaws"", the reasons he doesn't see me as someone long-term. I started crying, because what else am I supposed to do when the person I love is telling me why he thinks I'm an awful person? It turned into an hours long conversation that, by the end, apparently had him wavering in his decision.

Next day, he went out to dinner with one of the other interns and their supervisor. He apparently talked everything out with the other intern, and whatever was said is enough to change his mind. He came back to me, told me leaving me would be a mistake, and was fired up at the idea of us staying together. I wasn't convinced he'd changed his mind overnight but I didn't have it in me to tell him to stick by his original choice. I didn't want to lose him.

He left and for about a month and half we were texting nearly every night, a lot of it was lovey dovey crap, though I did have breakdowns a few times at first. I was having trouble getting over the things he'd said before he left about initially not wanting to stay together, but eventually I started to feel comfortable with us again. We had planned that I would drive straight to his place after my internship ended. One night, he asked me to stay with him for a month. It was almost pleading, I could tell he really wanted it. I couldn't say yes, even though I told him I wanted to, and the next day he told me he wanted to get a hotel room in a nearby city for when I come out there so we can drive out and have a fun night. Of course I was excited by it. I'd never been on a romantic trip before, and the fact I really loved this guy made it all the more amazing to me.

And then the three weeks leading up to my departure things started to get distant on his end. I could feel it and my anxiety over it started to show in my own texts. About a week before I was supposed to leave, he texted me out of the blue how excited he was that someone who loves him a lot is coming to stay with him and that it's an awesome feeling. At the time I thought it was weirdly worded but just an awkward attempt at being sweet, and in retrospect I wonder if it was just an attempt to psych himself up for something he wasn't really looking forward to. I gave him a flirty, teasing response and we started talking about other things but he was cold and distant again, almost argumentative. I asked him a question that he never responded to, so I left it until the next day when I sent him a little emoji in hopes of reminding him of the question.

Instead, he sends me a break up text telling me he can't do this anymore, he can't shake the feeling I'm not the right one for him, that he knows he should call to break up but that he didn't want me to cry and bait him back in and that he knew he should've said something before he left but I was crying so hard then and he couldn't stand seeing me like that. He refused to take a call that day, coldly telling me that there was nothing to talk about. So I texted him my feelings on it. 

Because of how much he meant to me, no matter how things turned out with us, I wanted to be able to look back on all of it positively. I don't want to hate him or harbor any bad feelings, and I don't want him to hate me. I was hurt that he ended it like this, I had once told him that, imo, a text message break up is the worst way to end things with a person, but I held it in, because I didn't want him to feel bad about ending things and not feeling the same for me anymore. We were eventually able to sort of talk things out, he never said much and I was left more uncertain of why and how it came to this than before but certain it was over for him but, I had hoped, we ended things on good terms. 

A couple weeks later (this is about five days ago, and maybe two and half weeks after the break up), I'm back home. I went out on a date with a guy I met through OKCupid. He's a nice guy, attractive, smart, ambitious but it's probably too soon for me because I spent the whole evening comparing him to my ex and he didn't quite match up. I also had a bit to drink on this outing. I ended up going home depressed and frustrated, and plagued with angry thoughts about how my ex ended things and ""why do I still have to be in love with him, why can't i just move on"".

So, like an idiot, I text him about a surprise gift I'd been planning to bring him before he'd ended things, and how pissed I was that he broke up by text when I told him it was, to me, the worst way to do it and that I could've sworn he'd said he never would do it that way to a girl, and I demanded to know ""what did he mean in his break up text by 'bait me back in', would hearing me cry, hearing my voice, really been enough to change his mind or was it just more convenient for him to break up with me in text message and then blame it on me"". I signed the message with a ""fuck you"". 

In the morning, I was horrified by what I'd done and I didn't know what to do. Part of me hoped he wouldn't read it, and part of me hoped he would just shrug it off because he's over the relationship and over me, and a huge part of me hoped he'd figure out I was drinking because the wording in the text sounded nothing like a sober me anyways. I figured if I texted an apology or explanation that it would seem manipulative, which I guess I should probably mention is one of my fears is what he meant by the ""bait me back in"" comment, that he felt I was trying to manipulate him in the past by being genuinely upset about losing him and all the bad things he saw in me. So I do the only thing I can think of: nothing.

A couple days passed and he removed me from his friends on Steam. I have exactly three friends on Steam, well, two now, so it's hard to go unnoticed. I know when I started playing a game, my ex was still on my friends list. When I got off the game, he was no longer my friend. I might be overreacting, but to me it was a pointed thing to do, it takes a small, out of the way effort, and it comes off as kind of passive aggressive. I check on Facebook, he's still friends with me there, so I'm confused.

My first thought, of course, is the text message. I decided to write out a whole post on reddit, the one I deleted because I got the therapeutic release and momentary clarity of thought that I needed from it, and the next day I texted him an apology and short explanation. He responded faster than I thought he would, considering I didn't expect him to respond at all, that it was okay and he figured I'd been drinking. I don't actually believe him that it was all okay, especially since he has a pretty solid history of telling me what he thinks I want to hear and telling everyone else what he really feels. I make a big girl (maybe?) decision, tell him I'd hoped he'd figure that out, but it's still not a good excuse on my end, and that I'm going to delete his number so it won't happen again. And then I deleted his number.

There are a few things I'm confused/wondering about:

Removing me from his Steam friends list was odd, because I've never interacted with him on Steam before and likely never would have. After all, if I wanted to contact him to fuck things up between us further I still had his phone number. And I'm still on his Facebook so WTF? Other than the text, could there have been a different reason for him removing me?

Obviously I'm still upset about some of the things he said in the break up text. ""Bait me back in"" really makes it sound like he thought I was being manipulative and this could be due to one of two things. He had a bad relationship in the past with a girl he refers to as his ""crazy ex"", either he's relating my behavior to her or he actually thinks that my tears were a purposeful effort to manipulate him into not leaving me. Neither are appealing possibilities to me.

I'm also a little uncertain if he ever really changed his mind or if those last couple months of long distance was just him trying to make me happy. The way he said in his text that he ""should've said something back at the internship"" makes me wonder if he was just spending those months placating me. It makes me sick to think that the entire time we were having these intimate exchanges I was the only one that meant the things I said.

As of right now, I'm still on his Facebook friends, but he doesn't use it often so he might just not have gotten around to deleting me off of there. It's still important to me that we remain on somewhat good terms, has that hope been completely vanquished, is it stupid of me to want to stay on good terms in the first place, or am I overacting about him removing me from Steam?

Edit (Because I think there's a misunderstanding): To me, when I say I want to stay on good terms, I don't mean that I want to be best friends with him, texting and talking all the time, keeping up-to-date on one another's lives. I mean that I don't want to feel like I've been sucker punched every time I see him post something on Facebook, and I don't want him to feel like cringing when he sees my name and like he has to remove me from his social media.

**tl;dr**: The ex I am desperate to remain on good terms with recently removed me from his Steam friends list, and I'm worried it's a sign that 'good terms' ain't happening. Also I'm hoping for insight into a few other things that he said during our relationship/breakup."

It's poor enough having insurance once your a young adult man, however when you've a sports-car with a V8 in it it gets a lot worse. I simply purchased my dream car (a pontiac trans am) now I would like insurance so I can travel it...the car cleaned out my savings(im a mature in senior high school therefore I didnt possess a good deal to start with). I observed insurance is not bad, but IDK. Also, although I wish to have decent insurance not have my entire salary visit them either. Anybody have any methods or learn of any good insurance providers. Ps with no i dont desire to sell my car and purchase some Social lol


If your auto-insurance is full coverage, how do you know? my vehicle is borrowed and that Iam checking on geico.com?
I'm getting quotes and to somebody, generally i contact and talk and just say i was full-coverage. I am on geico.com and that is no option. They'll I'd like to pick actual harm responsibility and that I examined the container that said i was funding my car so maybe they offer me coverage that is full no matter what then


Do I need accident motorcycle insurance plan on a classic bike?
Im trying to ensure a 1997 Kawasaki Ninja 250 that was obtained for $ 1. I'd be utilizing the bicycle to work/ internship also to drive to campus.

Take into account that I head to university in a small rural town which will be quite bike-friendly.


Price of health insurance?
Just how much does healthinsurance cost per year easily pay for myself in place of my manager spending money on it? I'd spend through my employeris group insurance and quarry is just a family of three (including a young child of 4 years). I am a contractor and I will move through the country a great deal in which situation might the insurance charges be from the condition from wherever the workplace is from or should it's as per the state where i am residing? How can insurance charge vary to convey from state?

I don't think my standards are too high, so as long as you're a girl that can deal with an embarrassingly shy guy, you're in the right place.
I suppose I should write a bit about myself. I'll try and keep it short and point form, because that's what seems to be popular here:

* 6' tall, slim, medium length brown hair, green eyes, glasses
* hobbies include: playing piano, biking, reading (mostly sci-fi/fantasy), drawing, listening to dope music, watching movies, playing PC games (dota2, csgo, civ5, and more)
* Currently studying computer network engineering, although I have a year long internship starting January

And there you have it. Honestly I'd really like to talk to someone so I can take my mind off things for a bit."

Álvaro Gramática:  Isabelle!  What a lovely surprise.

Isabelle Ardant:  Are you recording this?

Gramática:  Hmm?  Oh, yes.  I record everything I do.  Never know when an unexpected breakthrough will happen.  How are you?

Ardant:  Terrible.  I've been tasked with archiving the genetic memories from Project Legacy.

Gramática:  Well, it's a shame how that ended, but I'm glad to see the data isn't going to waste.

Ardant:  It's a waste of my time and talent, just as your current assignment is a waste of yours.

Gramática:  Ahh, work is work.  Despite the setbacks in Denver, the Eye-Abstergo satellite is, uh, very interesting.

Ardant:  Vidic had his chance, and he's blown it.  They'll never find a new apple in time for launch.  The Animus Project is dead in the water.  Meanwhile, you and I are members of the Inner Sanctum and we're being treated like sodding interns.  But what if we could give Mr. Rickon a new, working Piece of Eden?

Gramática:  I'm listening.

Ardant:  Don't listen, look.  Look at this.  [Opens container]

Gramática:  P.E. #66!  Where did it come from?

Ardant:  The Project Legacy data revealed that the company acquired it in the 40's.  I want you to help me get it working again.

Gramática:  This fabric... it's very fragile, but there's technology in it!

Ardant:  You study the shroud, find out anything you can about its original purpose and methods of use.  I'll cross-reference the genetic memories from Project Legacy against my archive.  With any luck, I can locate more people who came into contact with it.  Together, we can unlock the artifact's secrets.

Gramática:  I get to play with an artifact *and* take Vidic down a peg?!?  How can I refuse?!?

Isabelle Ardant:  You called me all the way to Paris for this madness?

Álvaro Gramática:  Listen!  It's been months and we are no closer to get the Shroud to work.  The microscopic technology in its fibers is similar to what we've found in other Pieces of Eden: an alloy we've dubbed ""Bathoritka"".  This alloy seems to react specifically to thought, but the artifact itself remains inert.

Ardant:  That's still no reason for this course of action.  What if the Shroud doesn't save you?

Gramática:  Do you know just how much of Abstergo's money we've embezzled into our secret project here?  Because I'm sure Mr. Rickon noticed by now.  And if we have nothing to show for it?  So, I'm going to wrap myself in the Shroud, and you're going to do what needs to be done.  [Shuffling noises]  One way or another, our current dilemma will be resolved.

Ardant:  Fine.  [Cocks gun, shoots]  Oh, SHIT!  [Gasps]

Álvaro Gramática:  I'm not happy about this at all.

Isabelle Ardant:  Why must you always shoot yourself in the head to summon the Precursor consciousness?
Gramática:  Because it works!  I tried slitting my wrists.  Nothing!  I tried overdosing on pills.  I had to get my stomach pumped.  It was all very unpleasant.  It has to be a major wound for the artifact to activate.

Ardant:  The risk is unacceptable.  Without you, there's no Future Technology division, so I've brought you a ""qualified volunteer"".

Violet da Costa:  I'm Agent Violet da Costa.  It's an honor to meet you, sir.
Gramática:  Oh, is it?  I tried to recruit you once, and you turned me down for Sigma Team.

da Costa:  Uhh...I thought I could do more, um, good in the field!

Gramática:  Horseshit!  A dazzling brain like yours is going to waste.

Ardant:  Agent da Costa is assigned to you for six months.  Make the most of it.

Gramática:  Then let's get started.  Wrap yourself in the artifact, uh, please.  I know how to summon the Precursor, but I've never been able to communicate with him.

da Costa:  This is going to be an interrogation?

Gramática:  Bingo!

Ardant:  If it's all the same to you, I'm going to leave before the mess.

da Costa:  Mess...?  What did she mean by...  [Gramática cocks gun, shoots]

Consus:  I am Consus, the Erudite God.

Gramática:  Haha, yes, yes.  Uh, eh, hello.  I want to know more about you.  Tell me, did you create the Shroud?

Consus:  When I was flesh, I apprenticed with Hephaestus, the Maker.  The War of Unification raged.  We created devastating storms to end it, but then...  heal it.  I created shrouds to heal.

Gramática:  I suspected that it may have been a tool to treat casualties of war.  How does the Shroud heal such terrible damage?

Consus:  The body is a construct.  A machine.  Blueprints stored within.  Shrouds access these recovery centers.  Repairs damage to specifications.

Gramática:  Haha, a factory reset!  Wait...  shroud...s...?  There's more than this one?

Consus:  This is the original!  My prototype!  Created in the year 1923 of the Esu Era.

Gramática:  Esu Era?  I have so many questions, but, uh, let's stick with you.  How is it that your mind resides in this artifact?

Consus:  I was old, I wanted more time!  Bodies, constructs, minds are programs.  I uploaded my program into the Shroud to cheat death.  Succeeded!  Failed!  Trapped in my prototype, trapped in my forgotten land!  Alive!  Awake!  Cannot speak!  Only watch.  Generations pass.  Technology grew.  My kind created yours.  I never imagined machines like you were possible.  My descendants proved me wrong.

Gramática:  Generations?  How long have you been...

Consus:  The damage has been repaired.  Rest now.

Gramática:  Sigma Team's been disbanded.  You've both been reassigned to the Phoenix Project, and yet here you are, defying orders by breaking into *my* facility and trying to interrogate the Precursor.  I knew I liked you for a reason, Berg.  Proceed.

Berg:  Thank you.  [Shoots gun]

Consus:  I am Consus, the Erudite God.

Berg:  Tell me everything you know about the one called ""Juno"".

Consus:  Juno.  The Schemer.  Three centuries after my death, she found me.  Usurped my work.  Used it for her own ends.  He who is the image of Aita, he will herald her return.

Berg:  Juno wants to exterminate us.

Consus:  Perhaps once.  Your uprising was an affront.  But after the catastrophe, everything changed.

Berg:  Explain.

Consus:  I cannot.  She vanished.  Plans set in motion.  She lay in wait.

Gramática:  Then hypothesize.  What does she want?

Consus:  Hypothesis irrelevant.  Civilizations crumble.  Flesh decays.  Everything is impermanent.  Except the grey area inside of systems.  The connections.

Gramática:  Precursor minds are powerful.  If Juno is inside of a network, she *could* control it.

Berg:  And the planet grows more networked every day.

Gramática:  You are right to be concerned.  This merits further study.

Álvaro Gramática:  The Paris facility was completely destroyed, along with our best samples.  All that work, lost forever.  With that in mind, these are notes towards increased efforts in locating new Precursor samples.  I want to merge industry and entertainment in the hearts and minds of the public.  Every product and service Abstergo offers should be sending user data to Helix for us to look through.  That would be a tough sell to a public who's already scared of big brother, so...  we will sell them on ""big mother"".  Nobody likes it when the government snoops on our social media, but everyone's wearing an Abstergo Body Band fitness monitor.  What about an Abstergo stenographer?  We take a sample from the plaintiff and defendant, and then relive the case through the Animus.  Yes, that's what I want.  I'll ask Mr. Rikkin to lean on the Justice Department to get samples from the prison population, as well.  Laetitia has authorized a series of Abstergo clinics.  We're going to open them in cities around the world:  Abstergo Healthcare.  Imagine being adopted and finding out who your birth parents are, along with your entire medical history, in minutes.  Under Melanie Lemay's watch, Abstergo Entertainment has more users than ever.  That's great, but that's still a pretty small user base.  But we need to expand our demographics;  not a lot of virtual feature enthusiasts in the octogenarian sect, so let's make products that appeal to them.  I want to create a ""digital wake,"" where people can show the loved ones they leave behind their best memories together.  From the Angelus baby monitor to a virtual funeral, I want everyone on this planet to be connected to Helix.  Then we can... uh...  We can...  ah, damnit!  What's the use?  It's over.  I'm finished.

Isabelle Ardant:  Hello, Álvaro.

Gramática:  What the hell do you want?

Ardant:  Don't look so glum.  Let me tell you what I've been working on lately.  We sent Berg to India last year to chase the lead involving Koh-i-Noor.  It was a dead end, but we did manage to find some data on an Assassin from the 1800's:  Arbaaz Mir.

Gramática:  And?

Ardant:  And, while that's all very interesting, when we looked further into his genetic line, we found this.  [typing]

Gramática:  Arbaaz Mir's son was in London.  So what?

Ardant:  Look closer.

Gramática:  Blah, blah, assumed name Henry Green, blah-blah, seems he and the Assassins were searching for...  Oh, my god!  You found another one!

Ardant:  My teams are working outward from this sample.  We've scoured Helix and tracked down a set of memories from the Grand Master of the British Right: Crawford Starrick.  We're also looking for data on other Assassins of the era.

Gramática:  Do you have anyone searching for the new Shroud?

Ardant:  No one, yet.  You want to call in Berg?

Gramática:  As soon as humanly possible!

Álvaro Gramática:  Isabelle!  What brings you here?

Isabelle Ardant:  I came to gloat, actually.  Look at this data.

Gramática:  A Sage!

Ardant:  It gets better.  Check his patrilineal line.

Gramática:  Let's see, patrilineal line:  19th century American Midwest, 18th century American Revolution, 16th century Ottoman Empire, 15th century Italian Renaissance!  Oh, my god!  You don't mean?!

Ardant:  Yeah...  The best part?  His mother just walked him into one of your new clinics in New York City.

Gramática:  I'd really like to strip him for parts like we did with Subject 17.

Ardant:  Oh, no you don't.  You had your chance with the Shroud.  This asset is mine, and I won't be a party to the needless mutilation of a 10-year-old boy.  It's inhumane!

Gramática:  So, what do you plan to do with him?

Ardant:  Given his unique lineage, I think we should put him into an Animus for the next fifty years.  Think of the data we could extract!

Gramática:  That's terribly old-fashioned.  In any case, we should send Sigma Team to recover him.

Ardant:  No.  I'm going to keep an eye on him for now.  We'll collect him when the time is right.

Jeannie: Obvious one here, but I'd play almost anyone against her in some fashion. A new boyfriend that is truly her baby daddy... A past fling coming back in to her life and wooing her .... A booty call on a business trip that turns in to something slightly more serious.... Etc etc!

Monica: She needs a nice young stud to keep her busy, doesn't she? I'm thinking an intern that she tries to belittle and finally wants to ease a bit of tension and then realizes just how big of a boy he is ... and it draws her to him more and more even if they really don't get along on a personal level.

Others: April, Sarah Guggenheim, Marisa McClintock, Brynn

---The Office---

Pam Beesley: Something without Jim would be fantastic. Whether she's desperate at her apartment after breaking up with Roy that she'll give herself up to the landlord for more time/lesser rent... Maybe she's lonely and lets a warehouse guy take her for a ride that she can't help but want to relive on a nearly daily basis? Or an intern that she catches taking a liking to her and who knows where they go from there!

Jan: Another cougar that needs a young man. She's shown many times over that she loves interns and younger men in general!

Erin: Someone very dominate for her since she seems to be unsure/innocent... and she needs somebody that can break her of that streak.

Kelly: I have a feeling that she'd use just about anyone to make Ryan jealous. Let's give her a new person to do just that with. We can figure out if he's a perfect fit for her or just a guy with a dick that can shut her up for a few minutes at a time while they do some dirty things with one another!

Others: Angela, Meredith, Holly Flax....


---Buffy the Vampire Slayer---

Buffy Summers: Maybe she has a teacher that is particularly hard on her for all of her late mornings, sleepy headedness, and overall lack of performance and she decides that she needs a new method on how to get a better grade in this class? This could also work with a tutor/nerd in her grade that she has to 'beg' to help her out of a jam! And an overall arching theme to another line with all of the Buffy women would be someone gets a hold of the Love Spell that Xander tried to use but they are able to tweak it to one that only works on women that the male is actively thinking about... That way there's no crazy in there either. This man can be any age/race etc....So keep that in mind too for everyone else!

Cordelia: Queen Bee needs to keep her popularity. Will she suck off the head of the Robotics club to get him to get his club to vote for her for homecoming? Will she let someone from the Chess club take her from behind to get them too? Will she jerk off a swimmer to get the entire team behind her? How low will she go to keep her popularity in tact?

Harmony: Kind of the same as above, but doing it for Cordelia and being one of her minions. We all know Harmony is a slut so why not treat her like one?

Darla/Drusilla: Fresh meat for one of them ... Can be a human they toy with or a freshly born vampire that they want to take under their wing. Either way? I'd love to find something dark and dirty for one or both of these ladies!

Other women I'd play with: Jenny Calender, Joyce Summers, Faith Lehane, Willow Rosenberg, Tara or Dawn Summers.
Feel free to toss almost anyone else at me too as I'm sure I've missed some! Looking for something potentially long-term but I'm more then happy with just doing one scene if you'd rather go that route!

Other shows/games I could be interested in: Tales from the Boarderlands, Smallville, Halo, Until Dawn, The Guild, Parks and Recreation, Community, Firefly

And if we've had a line going and you'd like to continue, please let me know! Working full time can really mess with you when you're checking your inbox and I'm certain I lose track of things!

3qz6fu,192,2015-10-31,"""Burn it all down""",littledude23,BestOfOutrageCulture,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestOfOutrageCulture/comments/3qz6fu/burn_it_all_down/,"A recent thread in /r/AgainstGamerGate got me to thinking about all the times that our favorite movement for ethics in game journalism has declared an intent to ""burn it all down"". So I thought I'd compile as many examples of that language as I could find. (Many of these have been posted on this sub before.) In no particular order:

https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/2jkpqi/polygon_put_up_an_antigg_editorial_that_took_up/clcmpy5

&gt; We are only getting started. We are in this for the long haul. Apologies only cut it when they're issued within some sort of reasonable time frame + with at least an attempt of sincerity. These have not happened, and we do not forget. When their collective backs are against the wall, we will remember how they treated us. **Burn it all down.**

https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3km9mz/z/cuyogve?context=3

&gt; And then they reaffirmed all of this at the GDC, where developers and journalists stood up and applauded another developer erasing what I am so he could score points with the clique and label me as another straight, white male. And I haven't even mentioned the racism and sexism aimed at straight, white males by these people.

&gt; No, fuck them. **Burn it all down.** They wanted this. It used to be: No Justice, No Peace. Now it's just: No Peace.

https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/2w3lg7/journalist_accuses_icze4r_of_trying_to_cause/conaf89?context=1

&gt; Use this anger. we can all use this anger to motivate us to **burn down these evil fucking scumbags' entire industry to the fucking ground**, even if it takes us years

https://archive.is/KVjjW#selection-787.0-791.214

&gt; Yes, people are starting to lose interest over time. It's inevitable. But no problem, because that only means we are more dangerous than ever. 

&gt; You know what we do? We go out with our guns blazing and **burn it down. All of it.** Gamergate can't win, but it can't lose either. Mutually Assured Destruction. Because to hell if i'm letting them get away with this.

https://np.reddit.com/r/BestOfOutrageCulture/comments/2xb2um/the_current_oligarchs_running_the_show_and_in/ (original was deleted)

&gt; I can see why the enemy camp is so against adding in disclosures like these, because it perfectly illustrates how in bed they all are with everything and everyone. The current oligarchs running the show and in plain sight for the disgusting gamer proletariat. How dare they dissent and question the mass marketing hype and money machine we built with our parents trust funds in the bay area. **Burn it down. All of it.**

https://np.reddit.com/r/BestOfOutrageCulture/comments/2jfggv/you_get_the_torches_ill_get_the_pitchforks_and/ (original was deleted)

&gt; I would like to propose, that so long as #GamerGate is still going on this Christmas, that we **burn the hell out of the games industry as much as we can.**

https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/37ahwm/this_is_coming_off_as_really_aggressive_but_in/crl2ojg

&gt; If this was the assholes at Kotaku doing the same thing, I'd be saying the same thing. Fuck all these people and the damage they've caused pushing this shit. How many people in KIA have lost friends because they fell for the SJW narrative these fuckers spread around?

&gt; I lost 4 myself. **I want all these fuckers out of work and the the companies they've created around this narrative to burn to the ground.** Kotaku and Gawker especially.

https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/2gbtf2/sarkeesian_gave_a_rallying_cry_for_war_at_xoxo/

&gt; From the messages I've seen on the GG threads in /v/ many **people are ready to burn this entire industry down** to purge the corruption. I personally agree, my backlog will hold me for the couple years it'd take for things to reset and rebuild. Bring on the new Atari Shock.

-
&gt; It's just the journalism and indie markets where SJWs are stationed.

&gt; They're not in the AAA market, because they don't have the skills for it.

&gt; **And burning the journalism and indie markets down is fine.** It's trivial to get replacements for them.

https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/2yigbb/modtalkleaks_after_featuring_kia_on/cp9tov2

&gt; the cancer is rooted deep in games journalism and other venues of entertainment, such as comics and sci-fi- and reddit is no different in this regard- and it's up to us here on 8chan, reddit, twitter, and other websites, that support gamergate, to take these people down along with corrupt journalists.

&gt; **they will burn with these journalists when the time comes.**

https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/31d4l8/obsidian_and_pillars_of_eternity_megathread/

&gt; Boycott them.

&gt; **Burn these fuckers to the ground.**

&gt; Show them it is more dangerous to cave in like cowards.

-
&gt; I'm done. Not only will I never give them anymore money, this has soured me from ever touching Kickstarter again. There's man-hating mother fuckers running kickstarter anyways (posted months back) so fuck it. I'm done.

&gt; I don't want this game industry saved, **I want it to burn**. I hope all of these assholes lose their jobs and are forced to work at McDonalds until they die.

https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3oy07j/misc_my_professor_keeps_obnoxiously_talking_about/cw1ib1j

&gt; **Burn him to the ground.** Make him angry.

https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/30j4k4/discussion_table_why_is_the_vocal_minority/cptt3ya

&gt; **This is why I think we should burn Kotaku and such to the ground.** I've been advocating a scorched Earth policy ever since Jeff Gerstmann got fired from GameSpot for not giving Kane &amp; Lynch a 10/10. The gaming media is irredeemably corrupt. They have nothing but contempt for the very concept of objectivity. There's no fixing this. We need to wage financial war on them until they're gone and something else takes their place.

https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3h1d6c/discussion_my_thoughts_on_the_philosophy_tactics/

&gt; Try to reform the sites, **and if that doesn't work burn them.**

&gt; If we burn them all they have no incentive to be ethical (they burn either way), if we don't burn any of them they have no incentive to be ethical (if they keep being crooks they suffer no consequences).

https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/2l6grg/how_we_dealt_with_sjws_in_the_bdsm_community/clrw70z

&gt; Their tactics don't work on us. How do you shame a community that embraces every single insult it has thrown at us? They tried to mock our mascot and we stole it and made it a Neo Nazi..

&gt; We are building up our own resources but it takes time to do so. We can't just start a website or an award and expect it to be popular, it's going to take us a few months to build up proper replacements with enough content and to get good quality content. There are still naive people expecting a dialog and apology, **but I think many of us are on the burn it down and replace it plan.**

https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3dnilv/happenings_gawker_taking_down_the_article_now/ct786yo?context=1

&gt;&gt; Its time gawker died, its committed far too many crimes against humanity

&gt; **Burn it all down**, salt the fields.

https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/2ib0o4/david_jaffe_go_to_therapy_to_figure_out_why_it/

&gt; Reading shit likes makes me think maybe **should just burn it all down** to remind everyone who has the real power, consumers.

-
&gt; **It's not possible to burn the whole industry like you say, but we can still burn other titles.** If we can't get Madden or CoD down, we might try with Mirror Edge 2, the next SimCity, or the next Bastion, ect. And we need to drag friends and others into this!

https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/2koody/longterm_strategy/clnapqx

&gt; These sites and their writers need to be held accountable for the lies, hatred, and fear-mongering they are spreading. There needs to be consequences for the collusion and dishonesty of GameJournoPros, and any others who keep perpetuating misinformation.

&gt; **If part of the solution is to ""burn it all down"", then so be it.** Support sites you like, that's fine, but remember that these people can not be allowed to get off scott-free.

https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/32zn62/at_what_point_do_we_ease_off_of_sites_like_gawker/cqg55fl

&gt; Agreed. **Now they've gotta burn.** They had plenty of chances to do the right thing. But now we get kicked out of conventions cause of their lies?

https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/2keka9/a_respectful_but_negative_response_to_tbs_post/clkrg5x

&gt; I disagree with both of you. It's too late for dialogue. There have been past controversies which raised these issues, we were ignored and ridiculed. There is NOTHING worth preserving in the mainstream gaming press, **burn it down**.

https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/2j9o0q/wikileaks_supports_gamergate_on_twitter/cl9ps4b?context=1

&gt;&gt; I could get behind this.

&gt;&gt; I remember, oh a dozen years or so ago, I naively believed that the online world would herald an era of citizen journalists that would expose corruption, collusion, and crimes across the world.

&gt;&gt;Instead we ended up with a media dominated by post-modernist hipsters obsessed with feelings, tweets, and click-bait.

&gt;&gt;**Burn it down.**

&gt; Best part is, like anything else on the internet, **it's trivial to burn it down and rebuild it.** Ideas can't die, but the places supporting them can.

&gt; For years, **I've looked forward to the day we can burn down everything that's happened to gaming over the past decade** and rebuild. And for awhile, the 90's developers kickstarting new titles (clearly run out of the industry by an atrocious publishing system) signaled that it might be happening. Maybe it'll take longer than I'd hoped, but for now, **we can burn down the gaming media and build our own.** No more establishment.

https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3quvxy/censorship_breaking_sxsw_reinstates_both_panels/cwimeix

&gt; Now all that's left is to inflict as much damage as possible to those who helped kill it while we bleed out. the government, corporations, and SJWs all had a hand in it.

&gt; **burn them all down.**

https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/33bstm/remember_that_little_talk_about_that_phase/cqjf2k3?context=1

&gt; **We might have to burn down academia before this is over.** That's fine. We know better than any of them how to educate people using video games.

https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/2mulqa/context_on_the_uber_thing_and_how_it_relates_to_gg/

&gt; These people are all scum. Carr is an ex-London press insider who runs in very similar circles as Leigh Alexander. Lacy was at Techcrunch during their height of skeezyness before leaving to start Pando since she wanted to crank up the skeeze a few notches.

&gt; Let's do this. **Let's burn this industry to the ground.**

-
&gt; **burn it all down**, piss on the ashes, and salt the earth. This shit regrew once, never again.

https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/2y1jp0/take_their_hashtags_and_burn_them_to_the_fucking/

&gt; Take their Hashtags and **burn them to the fucking ground.**

https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/2lusaq/personal_accountability_a_rant/

&gt; And I lived under the assumption that was how most occupations worked.* But with the indie scene, especially that centered around SF; there is literally nothing you can do, if you're one of them, that will get you in trouble.

&gt; **We've got to burn it all down, folks.** Just my two cents.

https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/2kf2pc/to_all_the_people_shouting_scorched_earth_and/

&gt; You didn't answer the question. **Why shouldn't we burn Gawker to the ground?**

-
&gt; Insulting their consumer base, advocating bullying, not paying interns, advocating stalking celebrity, slander, all around low quality clickbait and there is more.

&gt; **Now can we burn it down?** BTW Corporation are not people.

https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/2njtt5/broteampill_has_a_discussion_with_a_prominent/cmed29q

&gt;&gt; And I'm frankly sick of seeing people be hurt by them, and seeing the medium I love most being encroached upon by them.

&gt;&gt; **Burn it. Burn it all down.**

&gt; This is why I'm glad GG started before SJWs could get their hooks into gaming any further than they did; we've cut the corruption off before it hit the roots of gaming. **Now, we just need to burn the shitty journos off.** Anti-SJWs have always been around, but not nearly as big as this group guarding against their unethical behavior (and SJWs are defined by their unethical behavior). Even if we're just a vocal minority, we're a louder and bigger minority than they are, and worse, they're the ones visibly abusing power. That's always gonna be worse than any accusations they can throw at us.

https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3qja60/are_we_on_the_same_page_yet/cwfohr3?context=1

&gt; Having said that, **burning the SJW financials to the ground is something I could get behind**. Even if it does require a dev boycott.

https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/2uz1h8/do_you_guys_realize_what_just_happened/

&gt; I don't know, **I'd kinda rather just burn their whole rotten shithouse down** and roll around in the ashes. It's not like we have some public image left to save.

-
&gt; **The ""burn it all down"" reaction isn't really that extreme** - especially when kept in a free-speech, business context. Compare Gamers Are Dead"" articles, the IDGA blo(a)klist, TFYC coverup, etc - all calculated, and yes, pretty extreme, efforts to bilk and deceive. It is not extreme to consequently demand the resignations of the like of Kuchera, Totilo, Cheong, and other responsible parties. That is what happens when you're bad at your job.

https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/2wgt8g/this_may_have_gone_unnoticed_but_here_is_a_list/corbrd5

&gt; **I am already in the ""burn it all down until nothing survives"" camp.** And yet somehow those human shitstains manage to make me angrier.

https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/2l2cai/gg_is_a_draw_buck_up_take_your_knocks_celebrate/

&gt; **And it's very pragmatic to burn down their ivory castles.**

&gt; **I'm firmly in the ""burn it all"" down camp as far as games media goes.** They're irrelevant at this point, just basically paid tumblr bloggers. It's when devs cave in to SJW ideology that I start to get worried. Again, notalldevs, but I'm tired of being the bad guy because they aren't vocally pushing back and we're seen as the fringe loonies.

https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/2k5b52/is_this_our_golden_age/cli1knr

&gt; I don't think so. Not yet. We're doing better than ever before, but we have so much more to do. I know that once I get home I'm emailing all of my favorite companies that advertise on Gawker still and doing everything I can to keep up the fight. **Burn it all down.**

https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/2sri0h/the_economic_realities_of_gamergate_by_liana_k/cnsd21v

&gt; **What part of burn it all down do they not get?** Yes the fact that the current infastructure in the media is causing good people to get hurt sucks. But this isn't the consumers fault. Its the media franchise that insists on being against the consumer and those that don't toe in line with there current beliefs. There are more than enough opportunities on the internet right now to make yourself heard. Look at Pak, look at Youtube celebs, look at the twitch streamers. If your ideas are popular people will support you.

https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/2jli2d/gamergates_silent_majority_is_finding_its_voice/clcyznh

&gt; It was around then that I genuinely started to think that these people are just... well, just stupid. They're unintelligent. They can't think properly. They just mindlessly regurgitate whatever the popular talking points among their peers are. I can understand this sort of going with the flow-style attitude when it comes to stuff you don't really care about, but as a video games journalist I really expect you to think about the positions you hold on these subjects, and very clearly a lot of them don't even bother to, or fail spectacularly when they try.

&gt; If it wasn't for Archon and a few others like him **I'd probably say burn it all down** and don't even bother rebuilding.

https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/2mr79a/heres_how_you_kill_gawker/cm6vgan

https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3jdqgi/how_do_we_get_the_mary_sue_declassified_as_a/cuolu3z

&gt; You don't. In fact, you encourage more usage of sites like TMS on Wikipedia. Some people are still in denial that Wikipedia has gone to shit. You prove it's beyond saving by allowing it to become more extreme.

&gt; **The only way to fix Wikipedia is to burn it all down.** The next Wikipedia will not allow blogs and opinion pieces to being considered ""reliable sources"".

https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3dbl4b/acma_halts_abc_gamergate_investigation_but_the/

&gt; As a communist, I say drop the hammer and let it burn.

-
&gt; So then why did the media lie so much? Why are they still lying so much?

&gt; I can think of two answers:

&gt; 1. GamerGate is very important to the world at large.

&gt; 2. The media lies about everything like this.

&gt; Either way the answer is the same, **burn it down.**

https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/2w8ybv/mark_kerns_petition_is_for_peace_talks_to_start/

&gt; Early in GG Jayd3Fox said it was enough and **to burn these institutions of corruption down** advertiser by advertiser.

&gt; I've just signed Mark Kern's petition and I'm sure some anti GG (hi guys) will love hearing I signed it with my real name as this will give them something to hunt for now.

&gt; I signed it because honestly it's sporting. This is one last chance to negotiate. This is one last chance for the press to sort out their issues. To come to the peace talks. If they refuse I **this is when people will burn them to the ground** and replace them.

3qzi3i,2,2015-10-31,"Grad school could almost be 100% paid for, but I'd only want to do it full time (18-24 months). Would I be an idiot to not take this opportunity?",theseyeahthese,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3qzi3i/grad_school_could_almost_be_100_paid_for_but_id/,"**TL;DR AT THE BOTTOM**

Hey pf,

I'm at a sort of early career/more schooling crossroads, and was wondering you'd be kind enough to give some opinions if something really sticks out at you.

I'm 25 years old, single (but might be within a year or two) and I am a little over 3 years out of school. 

Little bit of (**optional**) background : Studied finance and music, did pretty well, but completely screwed up the whole getting an internship thing, and was left with a crappy office job that was technically within the finance department but it was a sham-- I was utilizing 0% of my degree and making shit money. The only saving grace was the low pressure nature of the job and it let me up my Excel game significantly (which I was already a HUGe fan of). A year later eventually got some read-only access to DB's and started teaching myself SQL for about a year. Took a chance and scored a huge job switch to another company as an associate database developer (33% raise, felt I was king of the world!). I have been since promoted 3 months ago to mid level with another 10% raise to bring me to $66,000 gross.

**More Relevant**

I'm in a really fortunate financial situation as far as furthering my education goes: my parents saved up a lot in a 529 to pay for my undergrad, and I got enough scolarships that there was a significant surplus. After the market appreciated so much over the last 3-4 years, I still have a balance that would pay for pretty much all MS programs I've been looking up. My parents have generously insisted multiple times that this is my money to use for school if I wanted to.

If I was to go back to school, it'd have to be full-time, in my mind--my work hours can push 55-60 hours some weeks and I just couldn't effectively learn and complete more work in that situation; I'm almost burnt out as it is.

My problem is that the main program I'm interested in (Business Analytics) is quickly budding around the nation but fairly new, so there is not a lot of data out there to calculate my ROI. 

My parents and my girlfriend said in no fewer words that I'd probably regret it if I didn't take this opportunity.

Here are my perceived pro's and con's:

**Pro's**


*Fill in education gaps that arise from being self-taught and merge my business and technical background even more

*More job opportunities / better priority applying to jobs (since I already have some experience)

*Almost no monetary cost (excluding opportunity costs)

*Network with people who are passionate about the same types of things I am

**Con's**


*Up to two years missed salary

*Up to two years missing 401k contributions

*Uncalculateable ROI; more data needed. And I can't wait too long, I may be doing the whole house/family thing in 5 years.

**TL;DR: 25, making $66k as a database developer for which I have no related degree or formal training. Have opportunity to get a full-time MS for ""almost free"", in a technical but fairly new degree with little ROI data (Business Analytics). Is it worth taking off two years of work experience, income, and 401 contributions?**

Edit: I have no debt currently, please ask any other questions you feel are necessary!

3r07ak,1,2015-10-31,How do I start getting help?,xomm,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3r07ak/how_do_i_start_getting_help/,"I honestly don't know where to begin. I don't even know if it's depression, or how to find a therapist to help me figure out what's wrong, if anything. I've struggled with laziness and apathy and introversion for most of my life, and as I've progressed through college, it's beginning to impact me more and more. 

At my internships I was fine. I could focus better than ever before, got my job done and then some. Apparently was one of the more productive interns they ever had. But then I come back to classes, and I find it incredibly difficult to muster up motivation to do anything until the last minute. When I'm not under immediate deadlines, my mind just wanders, despite my best efforts. Then I get too embarrassed to ask for help, and it's too late to make my own best effort. C stands for commencement, right? 

I talked to my mom about this briefly, and apparently my parents took me to a psychologist when I was in elementary school (I barely remember it, tbh) to determine if I had ADD/ADHD, and I didn't get a diagnosis. I briefly went to a counselor and advisor at my university, and they helped me manage last semester, but felt like I got an air of disdain from them, so I stopped going.

So is it just me? Am I just a lazy shitty person?

I spend my nights beating myself up mentally for not putting forth my best efforts. Suicidal thoughts are almost daily, but I know it's not an option (I'm an only child). I promise to myself that I will change for the better, that I will improve. And then morning comes, the daily routine kicks in, and I think to myself that maybe everything is actually fine. And then the cycle repeats in a panic at night.

I don't know how to change. I don't know how to *start* changing. I don't know if I'm holding myself back out of laziness, or if there's something else.

Sorry for the probably incoherent wall of text. I just don't know what to do."

It's going to be years worth of frustration, anger, and self-hatred being poured out into a simple text field on my computer screen. I really don't blame anyone for not reading it, but if you do, kudos to you. I just need to get all this out, whether or not it is read by anyone. I guarantee this won't cover everything I'm feeling, or everything I need to talk about. I don't even know how organized this will be, because there's just too much for me to rant about. So, I sit here at a Starbucks in a leather chair hoping that writing out everything that's been going on in my mind lately will bring some form of relief to me, and that it will help me feel that killing myself is not necessary. But I don't know what is going to happen.


So first off, background on who I am now. I am almost 30 years old. I live at home with my divorced mother, and am about six weeks from graduating from college with my undergraduate degree in business. I really just hate myself so much, and I hate the life I've ""lived."" I have been working on applying for jobs since this past summer, during which I was working full-time as an intern in another state. Many college seniors have trouble going to class because they have many job interviews and usually land an offer during that last semester. They're ready to go after graduating and are very successful by age 25. Me? Absolutely not. I have not landed one interview despite applying for probably close to 100 jobs in the past three months. Never in my life have I been fired for a job or been rated poorly at a job. I've had experience managing and leading others, and my grades are stellar. I have a 3.8 GPA and am graduating with honors. Yet - not ONE FUCKING INTERVIEW. My life, just as it has been in its entirety, consists of rejection after rejection after rejection. However, I see everyone around me prospering so fucking easily, with no problems whatsoever. I have had my resume looked at by three professionals and have tailored it accordingly. I write cover letters, and I have a great LinkedIn page. In fact, I have more experience than most of my classmates yet, guess what - no interviews for me. The thing that I hate is I know I'm smart, I know I'm capable, and I know I could handle about any job someone throws at me - but I just can't get any fucking chance at being happy and finally moving up in this miserable punishment that we call life. Instead, I watch everyone around me do it. When the FUCK is it my turn? God damn, I'm pathetic. Maybe I deserve this misery. I don't know what I did, but maybe I do deserve this.


I am currently seeing a counselor and have been for about a year and a half. I started seeing a counselor because I have been experiencing severe anxiety in my late 20s, and have had depression for most of, if not all of my life. I thought things were getting better and my mindset was improving right before relocating this spring to begin my internship. I was fucking wrong. I have been in counseling working on a therapy that is designed to help me in dealing with negative emotions. I have recently recalled many things about my childhood that make sense - and really show why I'm such a fucked up and worthless individual now.


I was suicidal when I was six years old. In fact, these thoughts did continue throughout my life intermittently. I began to feel like I was worthless and I hated myself, and wanted to die as young as six years old. I realized that the reason for feeling this way was because of my little brother, who I will refer to as Jason. Now, my little brother is not quite two years younger than me, and he was always a very gregarious and outgoing person. We got along for the most part, but it didn't take very long before I began to feel replaced. It seemed he was a better version of me. These feelings started one night when my cousin, Gabe was hanging out with Jason and I. Everything was fine when all of a sudden, for whatever reason, the two started to completely ignore and exclude me. Suddenly, Jason was the one that Gabe wanted to hang out with and I was just nothing. I tried to include myself but they ignored me, and stopped talking to me. At such a young age I felt an intense sense of rejection and the more that I expressed it, the worse they treated me. This was the night that six-year-old me wanted to kill myself, so I went into the kitchen and grabbed a knife. I then said to my Mom that I don't deserve to live, and the next thing I knew, she took the knife from my hand and I don't remember what happened afterward. However, I do know that the next night (or somewhere around that time), my Mom lectured me and yelled at me for saying that I don't deserve to live and pulling the knife out of the drawer. I remember feeling so belittled and confused.


Around the same age, there was a similar incident. Jason and I were over at my uncle's house. He had married his second wife, and she had three kids - all older than me. Jason, myself, Gabe, and her three kids were outside playing and everything seemed fine. Then, all of a sudden they turned on me. Suddenly they became mentally and physically absuive, making fun of me, calling me names and throwing me around. I specifically remember being shoved to the ground by my cousin Gabe, and one of my step-cousins picking me up and throwing me. That same step-cousin got in my face and told me they were treating me this way because I ""always cry"". I WAS FUCKING SIX YOU PIECE OF SHIT. YOU WERE THROWING ME AND SHOVING ME ON THE GROUND. OF COURSE I'M GOING TO CRY. I remember after I had enough, I went inside to my Mom, grandparents, and aunt and uncle to tell them what happened. I thought that the adults in my life would protect me and rightfully allocate punishment to the assholes that were treating me this way, including my little brother Jason. I was wrong. They did nothing. They dismissed me as if I was just complaining. ""Kids just being kids."" I was stuck being treated this way. I think that's when I started feeling like I just deserved this kind of treatment, and that my little brother has replaced me. I remember going forward wanting to die very frequently because I did not feel like I mattered at all, and that now that Jason was here, there was no place for me. I was excluded, rejected, and I absolutely hated myself.


Over the years, as I grew up with Jason and my divorced mother, I witnessed Jason live the life that I wanted. Everything I wanted out of life - from a young age to now, Jason easily got. I remember right around eighth grade for me, Jason started junior high and this is where it exponentially got worse for me. I didn't really have that many friends because I felt that no one would want to be friends with me. I felt tiny, nerdy, and just plain different from everyone around me. Jason, however, was prospering with his social life. He had so many friends, and was so much more attractive than me. He was extremely cocky and conceited too and always reminded me of how better than me he was at everything. My grades started to tank around this time because it was the same shit coming back to haunt me. I just felt Jason was a better version of me. At this point I just shut down. Throughout junior high and high school I did nothing on the weekends. I spent them locked in my room. I ate frozen pizza on those days every single day, and all I did was watch the same VHS tapes over and over. I took frequent naps and was always tired. I never talked to my Mom about how I was feeling because I knew I would just get lectured, or she would just dismiss my feelings as ""kids being kids."" I remember three times when I liked a girl, and each one of those girls ended up liking or dating my brother. I dealt with this for years. I hated him. I remember making plans to completely cut him out of my life as soon as I moved away for college. I wanted nothing to do with him. I was a depressed, miserable wreck for all of my teenage years. I didn't listen to music, had very little friends, and the only way I felt okay was when I was asleep. I felt so inferior, rejected by the cruelty of life. Many times throughout these years I fantasized about just ending my pointless existance but I never got the courage to.


When I was 16, I got into a car with a friend of mine and he decided to take the car up to 100mph down a gravel road. He lost control and the car ended up flipping, and rolling in the air six or seven times before landing upside-down, totaled. Somehow, he and I survived with just scratches. Our families were overjoyed that we survived, and even though I had flashbacks and was terrified to ride in the passenger seat of a car for a couple years, I got over it. However, just in the past few years, I have started to believe that maybe I should have died in that car accident. Maybe something took place that prevented the correct thing (me dying) from happening. Maybe that is why I have no place in this world right now - and maybe I never have. I think about this all the time. I think about how maybe the universe, or God, or whatever you believe in, was attempting to right what was wrong by killing me off, and for whatever reason it did not succeed.


After graduating from high school, I attempted to go to college at a local community college. I wasn't really motivated to go to college at the time, as I wanted to work and make money. I was working at a fast food franchise, and after my first semester of college I was promoted to a management role at age 19. For the first time, I actually felt like I somewhat mattered. I was moving up in the workforce already, and suddenly, my less-than-par grades in college, high school, and junior high didn't matter. I was a fucking manager and was making $8-something per hour. This was in 2005, so I felt like it was actually something that Jason didn't have - as he was still in high school partying it up and living the life I wanted to live in high school, as well as in all other parts of life. Well, it didn't take long for that feeling of accomplishment and fulfillment faded away, although I did stay at that job for several years.


Okay, so I think I'm starting to digress and I really don't want to go through my entire life here because trust me, it's just not that important. Like I said, right now I'm almost 30 and living at home. The company I worked at this summer for my internship did not offer me a full-time job for after graduation because they didn't have any openings as they are being hit by China's economy. One of my friends got an offer though, a great one. So fucking easily. She's in a different course of study than I am, but she got the offer literally 20 seconds after I told her how I've been feeling worthless lately, and taking the rejection of that company quite hard. I felt so tiny, like I always have throughout my life. Everyone around me at my business school is getting interviews ans offers. Most of my classmates are 5-6 years younger than I am. I'm realizing that I've wasted my fucking life. My teenage years were spent in my room - not experiencing shit. Not experiencing music, movies, or FUCKING ANYTHING. I as depressed and a miserable wreck. Well, that's where I fucked up, and now I'm worthless. There's nothing I can do anymore. I really hate myself so much.


I can't talk to my family or friends about it because I hate revealing weaknesses. My Mom still talks to me like a kid. When I told her that I didn't get a job with the company I interned with, her response was ""well you better start applying!"" YOU THINK I DON'T FUCKING KNOW THIS MOM?!?! I'M ALMOST 30 YEARS OLD!!! FOR FUCK'S SAKES, I KNOW WHAT I NEED DO FUCKING DO!!!! Now, my Mom has never been there for emotional support. Ever. She has always been there for tangible support. She always would do her best to provide my brother and me with food, money, etc. However, she could never make me feel like I mattered, or anything of that nature. So I now sit here as someone who can't talk about my problems because I feel guilty for burdening people with my problems when so many people have it worse than I do - and I just question if I'm being whiny and dramatic. I feel like a fucking kid - I feel three feet tall and I feel worthless, that I have no future, and I fucking hate myself and the ""life"" I have ""lived.""


Considering I've watched my brother have everything I've ever wanted in life handed to him, all I know now is how to compare myself to others to determine my own self-worth. So that's all I do. I hate sitting in the basement of my university. Surrounded by future leaders - future professionals - knowing that despite my intelligence and experience, I have no future. I don't want kids, I don't want to get married. I want a great career. That's how I've always been - but I can't even get that. My brother? He just bought a house, and has a dog, and all that shit I've always wanted because he has a job that he got simply because he knows someone. That someone is my friend's Dad. He makes a good amount of money in a job he got with no relevant experience - just fucking handed to him. Life is fucking cruel and I hate it so much. It's a punishment, and I don't want to deal with it. My friends tell me ""but you're such a nice and good person"" and all that shit. Well guess what! Being nice, and being a good person has gotten me FUCKING NOWHERE in life. It doesn't pay the bills, it doesn't help me move up to the next level of life: having a house/my own place, with a stable income and a good social circle. Every time I think I'm about to move up it gets yanked out of my hands and handed to my brother.


Throughout my life, I've had these suicidal ideations and thoughts, and there was always two barriers preventing me from actually doing it: my family/friends and my fear of death. But recently, I've realized that my family and friends will be fine without me. It's pretty clear that they have great things such as jobs/other friends/families/amazing lives. They'll be fine. Plus, my Mom didn't even recognize that a kid at age 6 wanting to commit suicide isn't right, and that a teenager who just spends weekends locked in his room isn't right. She never took me to see someone, or anything. She let this happen. I don't know if it was out of ignorance, denial, or whatnot but she just didn't help me when I truly needed it (despite what I thought I needed back then). My Dad left and got married to his third wife and moved to another state right before high school - one of the scariest times of a kid's life. I remember the day he told Jason and I that he was moving. I was devastated. Jason took it fine - but I remember feeling so depressed knowing that my Dad, this guy I looked up to and looked forward to seeing every few weeks, was moving to another state, a seven hour drive away. They didn't understand why I was so upset and I felt so stupid talking about it - so I just pretended everything was fine. He eventually moved back after they divorced, when I was a senior in high school, but I only got to see my Dad once or twice a year during that time. It was fucking awful. So anyway, my friends have much better things in life than me, so if I'm gone, they are going to be fine.


Now, all I need to do is conquer this fear of death. This is really the only thing left that is preventing me from just ending my pathetic existance. I don't know how to do it, but I feel that unless things really turn around, I just need to wait until the pain of living in this cruel life/world exceeds that fear of death, and then I can finally just leave this terrible place. I'm an ungrateful, worthless piece of shit with no future, and that's just how it is - there's nothing I can do about it. I know that I have massive potential but there's nothing I can do to get my life started. I think this is just what is lined up in the stars, or whatever you want to believe.


Yet, for some reason despite all this - I still get up in the morning even though I dread it and hate it every day. I still go to school. I have no idea why. This whole semester has been so confusing. Feeling like this is the worst. Seeing everyone around me move up in life so easily is the worst. I'm not asking for much. I do have big goals deep down, but I just don't think I'm speical enough and I don't think I matter enough to accomplish them. And it's all because I had to live through comparing myself to my brother. I don't fucking know what is going on with me. All I know is I'm at a point right now where I'm slipping further than I ever have. Life is not about hard work and pulling through - it's about being born into the ""right track."" Maybe I should have died during the complications that were involved with my birth, or maybe I should have died in that car accident when I was 16. Maybe I'm just supposed to make things right, and that's why all of this is happening."
