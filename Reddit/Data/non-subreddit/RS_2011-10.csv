He was my first love and my first everything. We're both 19. I broke up with him because I didn't really have feelings for him anymore. I went away to school and he went to community college. He doesn't do well in school, doesn't have a job, and is just very reluctant to grow up. At school I'm taking 6 classes, and an internship. I worked 60 hours a week over the summer.

Another huge source of conflict was my lifestyle. I liked going out, partying, protesting, and spending time with interesting people. He likes staying home and okaying video games. If he went to school with me, we would not have the same friends or lifestyle at all.

He also comes with a lot of baggage. His family is beyond screwed up. I spent all of our time mostly just being his mother. Trying to get him to study more. He did make great improvements throughout our relationship, but at this point in my life it's not enough.

He's desperately trying to convince me to get back together with him. He adores me like no human being ever has. He's the kindest, most trustworthy person and he was my best friend. I'm afraid that I'll never find another person that will love me like he does. I'm also in a new school, in a new environment, and I find myself rapidly changing and it's scaring me. This is also the first time I've been without regular counseling in a year. "
kyetj,1,2011-10-02,An open letter to someone who cares,[deleted],reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/kyetj/an_open_letter_to_someone_who_cares/,"Dear Lady,

I'm sorry that you're upset and I realize what I did was not tactful. I cut you off and ran away, like I always do when I need an easy way out. Instead of listening to me now though, you're putting all the blame on me and misunderstanding my reasoning for going away.

I have feelings for you. You had feelings for me and maybe you still do, but nothing has changed.

I can't torture myself waiting for someone that will never be mine. You're a wonderful woman, and brilliant to boot. You see through me better than anyone I've ever met. The problem is it isn't okay to flirt with me if you're taken and not planning on changing your situation. You apologize for playing with my feelings, yet you continue to flirt despite me asking you to stop.

Call me immature, say I'm being a petulant child, hurl as many hurtful angry words at me as you want, but it doesn't change anything, because you don't seem to want to change yourself. I want you to better yourself and get an education, go out and show your talents to the world. Stop sitting in the middle of nowhere, waiting for the next time your boyfriend will stop by. Go out and get your license. Go out and get a job if you aren't going to go to college this year. Do SOMETHING that makes your life better in a tangible way. You deserve it, and you're only hurting yourself by staying stagnant.

I'm applying for an internship out of state. Maybe I'll get the position, maybe I won't, but I'm getting away from this barren wasteland of horrible people and few opportunities one way or another. Working on myself is all I can do, because I cannot change the world, and I won't be used for emotional support when I can go out and have a real relationship with someone that loves me as much as I love them.

I wish you well in life, and I hope you get to see this. I want both of us to be happy. I'm sorry about the way I cut you off so quickly. I can't change the way you feel, but I can hope with time the wounds heal and we can both move on.

Love,

ky8cq,0,2011-10-02,Please help me get home!,pleasehelpmegethome,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/ky8cq/please_help_me_get_home/,"Hello strangers and soon to be friends!!

I have a dilemma. And I also have a proposal.

DILEMMA:
I'm currently living (since May) in Melbourne Australia while I intern at a nonprofit organization here (where I do NOT get paid) and I need to get to LA  in December for my sweet baby niece and God-daughter's christening.  BUT I have no monies to get home :( 

My family can't help me as I am from a single parent household with four other children, and as you mighttttt imagine, we have never had large sums of money to go towards things like international plane tickets. I also nanny here for two adorable children and I am trying to save what I can, but really I barely make it by as it is with working full time at the organization and part-time with nannying/getting paid. I mean it when I say that I have no other options.

PROPOSAL: 
SO, as desperate as I am to get home, I started brainstorming ways in which I could get the money for the plane ticket to make it for my niece's christening and seeing my family around the holidays.  I decided that maybe some strangers around the world would be able to make seeing my niece (and meeting her for the first time also!!! she was born in June :) ) a reality with quite the random act of kindness.  

So, I ask you, on my hands and knees, if you are reading this, and you are in any position to donate ANY amount of money to the Please Help *ME* Get Home fund, and you understand how truly amazing it would be to make this happen for me, then Please, Please Please send whatever you can through paypal to the email address: 


pleasehelpmegethome@gmail.com



Any money that is left over will be sent back to you, I promise! The ticket - in case you would like to check prices yourself - will be from Melbourne, Australia to Los Angeles, California, USA.  I have a voucher for 20% off international airfare with United Airlines, so it will be cheapest to fly and book directly with them.  The christening is December 11th, and dates are flexible (though I'd like to see the rest of my family for Christmas in Wisconsin too, but beggars cant be choosers!) but tickets are anywhere from $1500-2500 USD.

And I would love to send you a handwritten note thanking you, so if you are comfortable, send me your address (anywhere in the world!!!) and I will send a card thanking you for your INCREDIBLE support and exceptionally GENEROUS gift.  Otherwise, an e-card will come your way too :)


THANK YOU so much too anyone and everyone who has any bit of money that can help me get home and donates it to yours truly. If you can't donate or even if you don't want to, then still THANK YOU for taking the time to read and maybe spread the message.  Please know that I will return the favor someday :)


Thank you thank you thank you!!

ky7b6,2,2011-10-02,Help! Having mom issues and need advice,throwitallaway101,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/ky7b6/help_having_mom_issues_and_need_advice/,"I guess I just need to vent and let it out about the stress I've been feeling lately.  It would be great if I could get your opinions/advice as well.  Some back story: My mom and dad divorced soon after I turned 18 years old.  I helped my mom through the divorce since she has several chronic illnesses, and my dad didn't seem to care and was still trying to take everything away from her.  We ended up getting kicked out of the house and homeless for a year, until we slowly stabilized and I was able to go to college while she claimed disability and retired.  I have no contact with my father, and I am an only child.  

However, after I graduated college and returned back home, the relationship between my mother and myself has been strained (I moved back last Summer of 2010, now 25 years old).  I currently have started in a graduate school program and commute to class (roundtrip it takes 1 1/2 hours per day), and I work part-time at a paid internship that is at another school (roundtrip 1 hour).  I am also in charge of mentoring college students in a Freshman seminar course.  On top of all this, I do a lot of errands and help my mother make big decisions that she ask for my help in.  For example, I got my mom a new cell phone, I took care of her when she was admitted to the hospital for 3 days (she is better now), I help her watch over and get her medications at the pharmacy, I tried to plan a nice vacation for us this past summer (but she ended up getting angry anyways).  Even now, I am lending a huge chunk of money to my mom so she can buy a car (we have been sharing one car...).

Lately, she has had more angry outbursts that have been directed towards me.  She even admits that she uses me as a ""punching bag.""  My mom is very hard on me saying that I am not responsible and that I deserve to be yelled at.  For example, and I know I should know better, I do not put the dishes away after washing them, I bang my backpack against the walls (we live in an apartment), I am not cautious enough when I drive, I used a debit card at a gas station (once), I clogged the drain in the tub because I forgot to use the hair catcher thingy.  These are just some of the things that my mom explodes on.  I don't know anymore if I really am a bad irresponsible selfish person, or my mom has anger issues.  It doesn't help that I look exactly like my dad, and my mom points out all the bad behaviors I have that reminder her of him.  

Overall, I am exhausted and don't even want to be around her so I try to avoid her (she fights with me about that, too).  I don't want to feel this way, but it is stressing me out and I am getting a lot of anxiety.  I don't even want to leave my room or go outside to avoid having to see her or do anything else that could set her off.  I feel morally obligated to not leave because I know she is getting older and sicker, and I am the only one she relies on.  Whenever I try to not engage in the fights (that can last up to hours), she then will say things like, ""oh i see, i guess it's f*ck you now b*tch, isn't it!? You don't give a f*ck?!""  I just want to be happy and want her to be happy, too.  I'm not perfect, and I take ownership of things I could be more responsible for.  But now I'm asking you what do you make of all this?  I am lost and don't know what to do or think anymore.  "
ky26p,0,2011-10-01,From 9 year-old dog walker to 26 year-old Sr. Web Developer.  A very detailed account of my career history. ,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/ky26p/from_9_yearold_dog_walker_to_26_yearold_sr_web/,"My first job was as a dog walker. I walked my neighbor Jim’s toy poodle Chauncey for a dollar a day. He was divorced and a lawyer and the dog was home alone all day so nine-year old me came over and would take him out and play with him. Every Friday, there was a $5 bill and a “Thanks!” note for me to grab and buy baseball cards with. 

The next time I started earning money was as a web designer. At 13, I listened to the Slim Shady LP non-stop. So when the Marshall Mathers LP came out I opened up the plastic, popped it in my discman, turned it up to 10 and listened to ‘Kill You’. My mind was officially blown. As a quiet freshman without a lot of interest in extracurriculars, I would come home after school and kick back on the computer. I eventually came up with the idea to start www.eminemunrestricted.com. It was a website dedicate to Eminem lyrics, pictures, mp3s, even a diagram with an explanation of his tattoos. I noticed a ton of traffic. I updated religiously. I would stay up until 3AM excited out of my mind thinking of things I could add to the site. I bought every Eminem magazine, his underground CDs, and scanned all the photos and ripped all the songs and put them up. I noticed polls I would put up would get thousands of responses. I struck a deal with the Peel Network when advertising rates were $3 CPM, and made a few grand. I got interviewed by Teen People. It was kind of awesome.  

When I turned 16, I figured I needed an after school job. I started working at a dollar store. It was at the Charlestowne Mall. The manager’s name was Jennifer and she was pretty nice. The weekend manager’s name was Jerome and was pretty cool too. He was a DJ on the side and would send me to Rent-A-Center when it was slow to pick up equipment. He got arrested for selling ecstasy shortly after I left. I worked there for over a year.

My next job was at Radio Shack. It was okay. I didn’t know anything about batteries and hated selling people cell phones, but I liked playing with the remote control cars. I worked there for a bout a year, before I went away to college. I came back for my winter break during my freshman year, and didn’t take it very seriously. I got yelled at for talking to a girl on the phone while I was on the sales floor. As a pretty straight-laced kid, i could not have cared less. I made a friend there, Alan, who would hook up a GameCube in the back and we played video games when things were slow.

I had my first internship the summer of my sophomore year of college. I saw an ad on Craigslist for a technical internship with an internet radio station, AccuRadio.  I had never heard of it but had a pretty big interest in music, and after an interview at a Starbucks, got the unpaid job for college credit. They gave me a free train pass to come to the city 3-4 days a week and I would come in and design MySpace pages and microsites. One afternoon we went up on the roof with a case of beer and tried to think up of names and ideas for an indie rock radio station we were trying to launch. It became what was now www.futureperfectradio.com, which still exists and I’m pretty impressed by it. 

I didn’t work the first two years I was at college, my parents were doing very well and wanted me to focus on school and gave me an allowence. As a junior, I had a pretty easy schedule and decided I needed a campus job so I checked Craigslist and saw my university was looking for an assistant web developer for the College fo Liberal Arts. My boss there was the department’s Web Specialist and taught me more than any professor my entire time there. He was a big fantasy baseball fan and loved a band I was listened to a lot (Wilco) and taught me CSS and really got me interested in learning as much as I could. 

After I graduated, I moved into the city with some friends before securing a job. After a couple weeks of watching The Simpsons DVD box-sets all-day I got an e-mail from a job I had applied to a web company about being a Web Designer. I got it on the spot, but it was about the least appealing job you could get right out of college. You had to get there at 8AM and they signed everyone in with fingerprint readers. I sat in a back office with very little light and designed and coded out sites that the sales team would give me. It was mostly lawyer sites and really shitty ideas people had that they got talked into spending $2,500 (not much) to have a simple brochure site. I hated it. The recession started to hit and my boss called me into his office and told me they were laying a bunch of people off and wanted to know my plans. I told him I wanted to be there until after Christmas (it was Nov.) and wanted to have a salaried job with benefits after that. I wasn’t too concerned with him letting me go after I told him I wanted to leave because I had such contempt for this company. They would bounce checks and treat you like shit. It was a long 4 months there.

Next job I got was the job I have now (well, close). I applied for a Web Generalist position that I thought sounded interested and got a call from the agency’s GM telling me they were actually hiring web designers. They brought me in for an interview and gave me a job with a salary and benefits. It was casual and fun and we would go to the batting cages once a week and get lunch and stuff. Two years in, I got a $10K raise. I really grew to like the people I worked with and look up to our company’s president. After another two years I got another promotion (just last week). I have a Sr. title at 26 years old. From here?  I’ll keep you posted.

l0m9a,1,2011-10-04,"To all those guys with long hair and women with short hair, I salute you.",[deleted],reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/l0m9a/to_all_those_guys_with_long_hair_and_women_with/,"I used to be a guy with long hair. However, there were two problems, which I will describe below:

I deleted(Yes, deleted. It is not coming back) my hair because:
1) After deleting my hair, people treated me MUCH differently. I mean, on a whole different level differently. In college, from day one, people treated me like an adult instead of a 'stoner' and acted much more professionally toward me - most people would shrug me off.  I cut my hair in the summer, came back, and was seriously treated so different that I had a hard time adjusting. EVEN my professors treated me much differently. In my first year of college, my professor disregarded me every time I came to him to ask questions or talk to him about his research - as if I would steal his research or use his research to make crystal meth. Afterwards, I was able to get a research position within the first year of having short hair - my grades were better and my discussions with professors were much more fruitful. There was no difference in my work ethic or how I acted. I still continued to smoke pot every day up until this year where I have since cut back due to professional job offers requiring drug testing.

2) When I did have long hair, there were multiple occasions when I was mistaken for being homosexual. As such, I suffered the same sort of brutality homosexuals endure - both in school and abroad. At one point, I went to the pool with my (then 8 year old) autistic brother in Canada and at the time, I was 16, and was chased out by a group of four 10 year old little girls who were constantly following me and my little brother, cutting in front of us, calling both of us names. My little brother, being autistic, was unable to comprehend what was going on. I, knowing better, didn't kill the four little girls. They chased us right back to our hotel room. It was by the far the worst experience of my life that still haunts me about how cruel these four little girls were. Their parents obviously were off at the bar getting drunk and they were very well-to-do. It would have been different if they had only attacked me but they attacked my little brother as well and that made my blood boil. I seriously contemplated injuring the girls. Girls, if you know who you are - you're lucky - Looking back, I'm seriously surprised that I didn't seriously kill you four, in all seriousness - I had a 3"" pocket knife on me that I was flipping around in my swimming trunks thinking about it. It has since then burned an image of Canada in my mind that I have a hard time not remembering.

Furthermore, from this experience, I was able to tell just how shallow and judgmental people are - even if they say they aren't. I remember being on facebook and seeing the same people who treated me much differently constantly saying they were 'not judgmental' and 'gave everybody a fair chance.' Yeah. Right.

I know how it is like to be a guy with long hair. It sucks. I removed my individualism to give myself a better chance at life. The week I got my hair cut, I had an interview for an internship and the next day, had a full-time internship job. I cut my hair specifically for this internship. I had been to 35+ interviews and had sent my resume to over 150+ companies and never even received so much as a call back for everything from internships and co-ops to volunteer positions. I don't attribute this directly to my hair, although, it did so happen to be at that exact time.

I started dating my girlfriend when I had long hair. I love her to death. She is one of the only people who I know who aren't truly judgmental.

Although I don't know how it is like to be a girl with short hair and I can imagine it being a little easier than guys with long hair since as long as you're hot, guys will still fuck you, I still salute you.

This was my rant, in response to a thread with a picture of a long haired guy who I look very similar to saying something like 'this is what you think you look like' and then a following picture of an ugly kid with long hair with 'actually what you look like'.

Cheers!"
l0bxd,10,2011-10-04,We ended our 3-year relationship yesterday and I'm not sure if we're making the biggest mistake of our lifes,throwaway_account_27,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/l0bxd/we_ended_our_3year_relationship_yesterday_and_im/,"I've met my girlfriend in university three years ago. Although I was in another relationship at that time, I found her to be a really great person who fascinated me from the first minute I talked to her. It just felt as if chemistry was right. 

After my girlfriend at the time broke up with me, I got together my with current girlfriend shortly after, which may not be the best starting ground for a relationship but we both were happier than ever.

We've been together for three years now and it have been three years in which I learned a lot about myself. We had a lot of ups and downs but managed to get through them. Basically because we both like to talk very openly about our feelings (in hindsight maybe bit too much). Everytime we reconciled with each other I thought we were one of the luckiest couples out there.

And now we're in a phase again where we both are not 100% satisfied with our relationship. We had been living right next to each other during university but we both started our internships half a year ago in different cities (about 400 miles apart). After her internship ended, she decided to stay and write her diploma thesis. I have one month left to work here and our idea was that I then move to her place and also look for a thesis. Her flatmate leaves next month so this would be a great opportunity to live together for the first time -- if it wasn't for our concerns. 

Last night (on the phone) she told me that it might not be the best idea to live together as she's sensing that it's not easy with us right now and that she couldn't have a difficult time while she was supposed to write her thesis. I understood that but went a bit further and said that it wasn't an option for me to move to that city and not live with her (because after all, she's the reason I'd be going there in the first place). I said that we should fish or cut bait and maybe break up altoghether. 

We then talked for a few hours, crying, and talked about how we may have fooled ourselves in the last years because we had so many differences in the past.

During the phone conversation I remained mostly calm and tried to see the benefits of not being together anymore but these thoughts faded as soon as I tried falling asleep. As much as we don't get along sometimes I love having that woman around me. I feel that we get on our nerves mostly because we are bad at coping with ourselves.

Now that I'm not planning to move to her city anymore, I'm desperate that we lose sight of each other although it may have worked out.

She said that I was the best guy she ever met but that the thought of moving together scared her. Some time ago she would have said '*yes*' if I were to ask her to marry me, but now, she doesn't know anymore.

reddit, what do you make of this? Ever been in a situation like this and can now look wisely back on it?

Thanks for reading this.



**tl;dr** Relationship of 3 years with several ups and downs ended yesterday because were in a difficult phase (again) and not sure whether living together will work out. Yet, we both miss each other."
l2br4,1,2011-10-05,"Okay guys, tell it to me straight...",[deleted],FilmIndustryLA,https://www.reddit.com/r/FilmIndustryLA/comments/l2br4/okay_guys_tell_it_to_me_straight/,"I want to know just how hard it will be for me to get a job, any kind of job, in the film industry and make it out in LA. I say any job because, while I do have some specific interests and experience, I would be just as happy to have a new experience and feel out where I fit in the industry. I understand that it will be hard work, that I need to network, that I will be working long hours, at first probably with little to no pay while I burn through my savings (and I'll need to do it cheerfully). I think I can do that, and I can deal with rejection and months of unemployment or uncertainty if I have to. 

My concern is, what if no one in LA will hire me at all? How will I work tirelessly without a place of work?

Right now I'm going to graduate soon and I'm torn between just applying to several places and going out there and trying my hardest for a while or going to a smaller market like Chicago where I know I have a better chance at getting hired and getting more experience.

It seems like the obvious choice is the more practical one but my interest is ultimately more in films than it is in TV and commercials so I feel like either way I'm headed to LA at some point and I guess I'm just wondering if it would even be possible to start there.

I have a few friends who have managed to land industry jobs in LA (their experience and credentials are much better than mine), I've had a few production classes and an editing internship in Chicago. And that's it, so my question to you is:

Will that be enough? How often do people hire someone they don't know who has little experience as an intern or PA for example?"
l1z93,1,2011-10-05,What do?,[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/l1z93/what_do/,"I recently graduated from college, found an internship, and started dating an old friend of mine. Due to work she moved home 350 miles away where she could find a job as a nurse, and because of money I moved in with my parents and commuted 120 miles a day to an internship. She works nights and it has been difficult to communicate with her, shes at work during my free time, and asleep when I'm awake. We text a lot when we can, it We've been together for a little over a year, and things were great at the start but now I feel like I'm just holding on. I just recently lost my internship, and have to look for work, preferably one in my field. It was really upsetting to be let go from this company. 

I had a minibreak down, what am I doing with my life, I need to grow up, I need to move out. I found a new job, they hired me, and I'm on a 90 day trial period with a raise and permanent position at the end. I went to the interview, got the job, and tried to do a complete over haul on my life. I used to smoke weed everyday, I know that effected me, I know that caused some of the anxiety. The long distance wore me down, we didn't ever have much time to date in the same city when she moved away and we just started a long distance relationship. I had doubts, and fears.

When we broke up, it started out on Thursday as ""Give me 90 days, give me some time to try and grow up and change somethings in my life and to secure this job."" I stayed there the rest of the weekend until Sunday it turned into, ""I don't know, I can't keep torturing you, we can't be together ever.""  We had broken up 2 times before this, both initiated by me earlier in the year. She's one of my best friends, I care for her, and I love her. I can't stop thinking about her, but I still have the anxiety. I keep questioning myself, did I do the right thing? You love her, but are you IN LOVE with her. Do you love her as much as she loves you? Could you just be friends? 

Since the long distance started I over analyzed everything. The entire time we've tried to date we've both been in difficult transitional periods with graduating from college, trying to find work. Part of me just wants to run back to her, ""Look, please let me explain, I've made a huge mistake.""

Am I happier with her? Yes. I know I want her in my life. I'm trying to use this time to stay 100% sober, and to take care of myself and nail this job. I just can't figure this out. Part of me feels like if she lived in the same town, and we could just date normally for a while it could work.  Marriage was never brought up, but what else is a long term relationship after college leading to? (I don't want to get married anytime soon, and neither does she) I just had my first day on the new job, and I just wanted to call her, I just wanted to talk to her. She's even probably moving close to me soon.  I think I'm fucking stupid. I don't know what I'm doing.

I originally posted an Internship position for my company here and in the time between postings we found a lovely intern who has now become our community manager, so I’m putting the idea out there again.

I know some people here aren’t entirely happy about unpaid internships. That’s fair enough, and I should note that there is no payment for this position. We do cover up to £500 a month travel expenses and provide you with free games. Our Community Manager now has ALL the Railworks DLC on his Steam account, so that’s a bonus.

While we can’t guarantee a position we’ve had hired our last two interns, which is a good amount of success. I’ve not seen us let anyone promising leave in the last 7 months ;) I was also an intern here, and now I'm really super important and have my own iPad holder.

This position will include making and editing our product pages, approving and monitoring customer reviews, helping out on our forums, helping the operations team with marketing tasks like creating contact sheets, researching and contacting other gaming sites, helping out with social media, writing blog posts and so much more.

We don't have a really long list of definite requirements: You need to be able to speak and write English really well, and you need to be able to use a computer, Office, FTP and all the usual stuff. Knowledge of gaming is very important as well, obviously.

We'd be looking for someone to commit to about a month of roughly 9-5 hours, we can be reasonably flexible on that.

Drop me a line at robert.clarke@greenmangaming.com if you want more information :) If you applied before and I never replied – I apologise, feel free to apply again.

* 8 Months Ago: I broke up with my abusive ex-girlfriend of one year. It was my first real long term relationship and I learned a lot from it. I still love her, but it was not a good thing for me.
* 7 Months Ago: I start hanging out a lot with my friend Eric and his two good friends Chris and Linsey. The four of us become really close nit. We hang out every day for the next three months until the end of the school year when they all graduate.
* 4 Months Ago: They graduate, move away, I start my summer internship
* 3 Months Ago: Chris breaks up with Linsey. They had been dating for a very long time, almost all of their college life was spent together. Chris is generally fine, but Linsey takes it really hard. She's crushed. Since I grew close to her I reach out to her and let her know that I'm there for her if she needs me. We start talking pretty much everyday. I help her with her issues, and she helps me with mine.
* 2 Month Ago: I need to be in near her house at 6:30 am for my internship. Since I love so far away I crashed at her place so I wouldn't have to get up at 4am to make it to work. We hang out. Go to the bars and watch some tv. Talk about life and everything. Over the next month we hang out a few more times. I realize how absolutely incredible she is.
* One Month Ago: I realize that I am in love with her. It drives me crazy. I start stressing about it. I'm a nervous wreck for about two weeks. I can't stop thinking about her. (I have an anxiety problem, so it's really not a surprise). I also realize how deeply she is still in love with Chris, and that she won't be over him anytime soon. Even if she could love me, there's no way that can happen while she is dealing with Chris.
* Last Week: I tell Linsey that I really like her (I don't tell her I'm in love with her), but I know that I can't be a romantic part of her life right now, so I just want to be friends. I can't worry about the future, and what will happen between us, and that I am just happy to be able to be her friend.

She is the most beautiful incredible girl I have ever met in my life I am absolutely head over heels in love with her. She's gorgeous, and one of the coolest people I've ever met. Everyone who has met her knows this. With me it goes deeper than that. We have a connection that I have never had with another person before, male or female, romantic or otherwise.

She thinks the same way I think. She *understands* me, like nobody else has before. I tell her something and she's either been through it already or knows how to help, and vice versa. She has the same musical tastes as me. She knows her art. She has such a brilliant mind. I could talk to her for hours about philosophy, politics, art, religion, and have a deep interesting conversation, even if she knows nothing about the topic. She obsesses over things like I do. She has a passion for life and a such a strong will that I can't even begin to explain. In short, she's my soulmate (if such a thing exists).

And yet the odds of us being together are so incredibly slim. It is going to take a long time for her to have dealt with Chris, and our time together is so short. I will likely move to the west coast, and she is going to the east. And on top of that I only get to see her once a week, if I'm lucky. There are so many problems. The sensible thing to do would be to give up hope. Accept that we will never be more than friends. The situation is too hard to overcome. It would be a healthier relationship in the longrun.

*But I would do **anything*** for her. I would move to the east coast. I would wait. I would give up everything just for the chance for her to feel about me the way I feel about her. All I want is that chance, and I don't think it will ever come. 

But at what point does love matter more than logic? Is she special enough to take a chance? Will I ever find another girl like her? Am I missing my opportunity? *What the hell am I supposed to do?*"

My company has a few positions open right now and we are looking for some good programmers to fill them.  A little bit about the company.  We are small but very aggressive, fast growing company located in the Carrollton/Farmers Branch area.  We work hard and they take good care of us.  I've been here for about 2 years now and I have to say its the funnest workplace I've been at.  Great coworkers and very interesting work varied work.  If you are looking for a boring 9-5 programming gig, keep looking.

We have one full time position and a few internships open.

For the interns, they are looking for people currently enrolled in an undergrad or masters computer science, computer engineering, software engineering, or electrical engineering degree.  I started out with the company as an intern, and I have to say they were always very flexible with me with school and hours and always understood that school is the number one priority.  I don't know exactly what they have in mind for the interns.

We have a hand held inventory scan gun that we have developed in house and we are looking to expand the team who works on it.  This is where the full time position comes in.  We are looking for a programmer with 1 to 2 years experience.  Preferably in C, embedded systems and/or Linux.  Electrical knowledge or an electrical engineering can be a bonus but is by no means is a requirement.

This isn't an official job posting.  Its just a guy on the team who wanted to give reddit a crack at the positions in hopes of getting more and higher quality resumes.  I have no interest in this except getting someone brought in that will be a good fit for the team and who plans on sticking around so I will answer any questions you have completely honestly."

need your help Reddit.",Todayisthefirstday,GiveMe40Days,https://www.reddit.com/r/GiveMe40Days/comments/l170b/give_me_40_days_to_grow_from_a_child_into_a_man/,"Heres what has lead up to me posting this:
I've been a slacker all my life, somewhat privileged upbringing, few responsibilities.  I never had any self-confidence in school or anything because I have extropia (or amblyophia, I cant remember), which, after seven surgeries, is still at a fixed angle (for those not familiar, it means my eyes point different directions).  It’s led to a lot of self-doubt and self-hate, which has led me to develop several bad habits, blaming this.  It's really hard for me to get over it sometimes because i constantly see it, and i hate looking into anothers eyes.  Despite this, I've still gotten into a pretty good school, and had a couple girlfriends.  

But now, in my senior year, it’s all unraveling.  I'm out of shape, I lie constantly to maintain my lifestyle (even to my parents, which I really hate), smoke and drink too much, am currently in the process of losing my gf, whom I adore, because I can’t stop with porn (with some fetishes which she really doesn't feel comfortable with) and I never have tried in school.  I actually did quite horrible my first semester and I’ve been wavering between acceptable and slacker for the last three years.  I don’t own up to any of my responsibilities and consistently let people down ~~(especially my gf)~~.  I’m on a terrible path toward mediocrity and even though I’ve constantly promised change, I have yet to deliver.  I could fill pages with all the things I should be doing but am not.  Recently, I’ve slowly been coming to the realization that I am nothing but a spoiled child who deserves nothing of what I have.  I want so bad to rise above how I see myself and how I think others see me, and I know people aren’t that judgmental of my eyes and are totally willing to accept me for who I am ~~(like my gf)~~.  

So today reddit, I am stepping off the ledge of self-doubt into the abyss of uncertainty.  I recognize that even this effort might not be enough to save my relationship, I’ve got to try.  It’s do or die.  I’m running out of time before I have to go into the real world, and I really don’t want to get there with my metaphorical (or literal) pants around my ankles.  As of right now I’m going to embark on a 40 day journey to change from a child into a man.  Reddit will be my guide and support, my rock.  I’m using any subreddit that can help. 




Primary Goals:

*Get up at 7 every morning to start my day.

*Quit drugs and alcohol. Cold turkey. 

*Work out consistently every day. Eat healthy as well. (No soda, fried foods, lots of greens.)

*No fapping. No porn. 

*Spend at least couple hours a day doing homework a day, even if it’s not day the next one.

*Track down an Internship related to globalization, poverty, or immigration in NYC

*Put a lot more effort into my clubs.

*Get of my lazy ass and stop blaming things on my lazy eye (sneaky bastard keeps trying to get away).

*Become a man of my word.




Secondary Goals (when/if I find myself with downtime):

*Pratice piano/guitar, don’t just let them gather dust.

*Restart learning French

*Start my new club

*Meet one new person a week.



I’ve been debating cross posting this on ChallengeAccepted and other reddits to tell more people so I would feel more guilty about failure and less tempted to do so, as well as reaching a larger audience because, frankly, I’m going to need a lot of help, but I’m new to reddit and I’m not really sure if that would be ok, or if they would let me, or honestly how it works.

And final side note. As I was about to post this, I got broken up with. Now I feel like this is even more of a sign that I need to change.  It really sucks, but I’m not at all surprised.  

**TL;DR: I've been a shitty person for a long time, I hate who I am and now its falling apart.  I am changing my entire life, using Reddit as a guide/support. Want to help**

Any and all advice/help is much appreciated.

Thanks."

l2twq,2,2011-10-06,Jealous and paranoid..,yoyo1321,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/l2twq/jealous_and_paranoid/,"Hello everyone!

I'm male 22, and she is 19. We are together for 2 years already, and we study together in uni. The problem is that now she has to spend 6 months away to do her internship in france, while I'm here in germany, and we decided for the LD.

First problem is that the weather here sucks compared to france, I don't know if this is relevant, but since the weather is rocking now, she feels like going to parties every day. The second problem is that she came together with a huge batch of internees, that just want to party every day and only think about being drunk and humping each other. Since they are only working, they don't have assignments (homeworks) for the evening or weekends, therefore they also travel around a lot during holidays and weekends. She often go to clubs, bars and parties.

She is very sweet and never did anything that would bring suspicion to me, I trust her very much. She was never the drinking type. But she is with a friend (f) that is outgoing and likes to drink. Last month, out of 4 weekends, she puked 3 times from booze and traveled with friends to the sea (with 6 guys 3 girls). She tells me everything and I think that she never lies to me.

But jealousy is tearing me apart.. I don't know what to do.. as much as I force myself to think that everything is okay, I keep suspecting her! I have a horrible background with previous girlfriends that cheated on me, myself as well in some cases ;D. We talk everyday by skype and exchange some e-mails along the day, but when the weekend comes, I literally hold my heart not explode of fear. I feel I'm getting paranoid, since I check her facebook and think about her constantly, that's crazy! This never happened to me before.. 

I've visited her once already, and it was really great! We love each other, I'm pretty sure about it. The only thing that bugged me, is that I didn't get to know any of her friends! Her friend avoided me the whole time, and while I was there she wasn't invited to any parties, although there were some. As soon as I left, the parties continued and I feel clueless what to expect. This will all be over in 4 months from now, but I'm felling pretty shitty about the situation.. LD never more I think..

The question is: How do you people avoid jealousy and illogical thoughts?

Thank you!"

We met 2 years ago as I was finishing up my undergrad. Did the long distance thing as I lived 3 hours away in an apartment at school. He lived at home with his parents. I was under the impression it was just a temp. thing since his last roommate moved out when she got married. 

Fast forward to last year. I decide to move back to my home town, where there are less job prospects, to be with him. I move in with my parents and start an unpaid internship. He is still living with his parents while working a semi-decently paying job. The discussion of him buying a house has come up, but nothing has really been done about it. 

Now to now. I'm finished with my internship, unemployed, and living with my parents. He is still living with his. His mother will call if he is out to late to see when he is coming home. She does his laundry. Being alone in his bedroom to hang out with the door shut is not allowed. And when they go to bed, usually around 10/11PM, I have to leave. 

I feel living at home is holding him back from actually growing up, since he is not forced to do anything for himself. He doesn't need to cook for himself, do laundry, or clean/fix anything around the house. We have started to discuss marriage, but I don't want to become a replacement for his mother. I want him to learn to live on his own before taking the next step.

So TwoX, how can I gently tell my boyfriend that he needs to man up and leave the nest?"

 I’ll understand if this gets downvotes, I just don’t have anyone else to talk to. This probably belongs in relationship advice, it’s just a I feel like I have formed a bond with you ladies and I feel like you can be honest with me without tearing me down much.

I lost my first love, and I am not handling it well. It has been 110 days since we broke up. We had dated for 3 years, which included one year of spending nearly all our time together split between two apartments, one year of living together, and one year of long distance. The first two years were the most incredible times of my life. I’m somewhat fearful that I will never feel that way again, but I am still happy that I had the opportunity to feel the way I did. Last summer he moved 5 hours away for work while I was left behind finishing up my final year of school. This caused a rift in our relationship. I was hurt that he didn’t look for any jobs near where I would be and the fact that he didn’t provide any explanation for not wanting to move to the area that he moved to. It was pretty sudden and out of the blue. The following year was difficult. I was stressed managing a full course load and work and he was stressed trying to take on the challenges of being a new teacher. Even with all this stress, we still managed to find time to see each other once or twice per month, used Skype often, and talked everyday. We had many arguments, but we are both stubborn and wanted to see things work. Around March everything began to crumble. During this time I was looking for jobs near him but was not having much luck. At the same time he wasn’t making a lot of effort to look for a job even though he had turned in a letter of resignation in February. Our arguments worsened more and more. By May our relationship was in tattered pieces. My internship offered me a very good position and his school offered to take him back teaching a subject he was absolutely passionate about. He had only applied for one school district near me and I had not heard from any of the places I had applied to near him. The only option we were left with was for one of us to give up our job and move to an area that didn’t have anything professionally waiting for us. He had decided that he wanted to move near me even though he had no real job prospects. A day before he had to tell the school board I told him that I thought he should just stay where he was. He became very angry, didn’t feel like I wanted to be with him, told me that he didn’t believe I loved him and within a day we were broken up.

I realized that part of this is my own fault. I made a lot of immature mistakes and I believe he made some too. He was my first everything. What hurts the most is knowing that if I would have done a few things different that we would probably still be together. If I wouldn’t have made such stupid mistakes, he would still be in my life. He made me laugh like no other person could. I shared everything with him. Everything just felt right in the world.

After the breakup I followed advice and deleted him from facebook, started working out, found new hobbies, reconnected with other friends but nothing seems to ever work. Not a day has gone by since then that I haven’t cried. I feel like I have lost myself. I have no desire to do anything to aspire to anything. I go to work, I spend the evenings and weekending trying to wrap myself up in projects, friends and family yet still when I try to go to bed, I lie awake haunted by tears and memories. 

One of the biggest issues I am having is that I don’t feel like I have anyone to talk to about this. None of my friends or family liked him. When I tried to talk to them after the breakup I felt like I received no pity. They told me it was for the best and to just move on. Just tonight I tried to call up a friend who didn’t know my ex too well. He told me that he thought I was over this, that I needed to just get over it and to go to sleep. He told me that I had to either “Shit or get off the pot”. 

Now that it has been four months it is even worse. I am in no way over him. It still hurts everyday. He won’t talk to me. I tried a couple times to talk to him but he avoids me though any means of communication I try to use. I have no idea how to get over him. Are my friends and family right? Should I be over this by now? Should I have moved on by now? Should I be feeling better by now? 

If you made it all the way though this, I commend you. I probably would not have. If you did, I warm-heartedly thank you.

l4o3d,4,2011-10-07,"College student, 4822$ in debt (not counting student loans).  Money situation explained inside, and question about debt consolidation loan.",brandnewaquarium,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/l4o3d/college_student_4822_in_debt_not_counting_student/,"Long story short, I'm currently in school working 20 hours a week at 12 an hour - it's a programming gig, basically.

Last year, though, the shit hit the fan.  I'm not going to go into detail here, or make excuses, or explain the reasons behind the debt, because regardless of what happened, it's there and I need to take care of it.

A few points:

* I have never been late on a bill by more than perhaps a day or two.

* My oldest credit account is roughly 4 years old right now, and prior to last year's financial crises was never at a high balance.

* I've never been evicted, and only recently have had any account become overdrawn.

* I've previously worked 40 hours a week while going to school at the same time, but I'm not in any shape to do that anymore.  I'm attempting to do upper division classes right now and am already taking the minimum number of units required to be full time, just to balance my work schedule.

* I cannot quit or take a break from school, otherwise I will lose much of my financing and will thus have to take bigger student loans - not my idea of a walk in the park.

* Before you suggest it, I am, in fact, applying for scholarships.

* This will be my first year on FAFSA being listed as an independent rather than a dependent. 

So here's the deal:

* One credit card - one of those introductory cards they use to lure students into creating massive debt - is at about $2300/2400.  I've been doing 100-200 payments on it every month; last month I paid 150 on it.  It's stuck at 2300 because of the interest rate.

* The second card is at 1700/1800 and has also been that way for several months, with 100-200 payments every month - same here with basically paying as much as I can afford every month.  I discovered my phone bill was being drawn from this card, so I am currently working on suspending the line or at least not having it auto withdraw from that card.

* Due to a terrible room mate leaving me high and dry, I owe an old apartment complex $728 (no-interest, according to them).

* Previous room mate dickery drained my savings of about 5k already.  I was unable to sue this person for damages caused.

* I recently paid the last of a few thousand in medical bills from last year as well - yay small accomplishments?

Here are the steps that I'm taking.  Let me know if these are batshit stupid, or what:

* This year I took out a slightly larger student loan than normal; a total of $15000 instead of simply $10 000.  That is, federal loans plus a $3000 private loan.  This makes me even more depressed, because paying off debt with debt sounds counter-intuitive.  However, the student loan's interest rate is lower than either of the credit cards by about 5-10%.

* Cheaper phone.  I have a really hard time getting around is the main problem, but I'm going to sell the phone I received as a birthday gift last year in order to have some extra capital to put onto the credit cards.  This should net me anywhere from 300 - 450

* I'm selling the computer I received when I started school from scholarships.  This should net me roughly $900 (it's a really nice computer, got it for free but received a new computer as a gift not too long ago).

* I'm about two to three years from graduating with a degree in computer engineering.  Next semester I start upper divisions.  I have an okay GPA, though it was tanked last year to just barely a 3.2.  I'm hoping this summer to look into an engineering-type internship that'll pay more than 12 an hour like my current job does.

* Why yes, I do apply for scholarships and am already transferred to a cheaper state school.

* Parents don't live anywhere near any colleges, so moving back in with them is not an option.

Living expenses:

* I bring home about $1000 a month, and my parents send me $200 every now and then.

* $200 for rent.  I've already paid this through December.

* Bills come to about $100/month for me, not counting my phone bill.  I'm looking at ways to cut out my phone bill currently (I already receive a discount on the phone bill, but I'm trying to cut as much fat from my budget as I can).

* $400 roughly for transport - indisputable.  I've spoken with a loan counsellor about getting rid of my car, and it's just illogical to do that, because I would still have to pay the last bits on the loan.  (Keep in mind I'd bought the car when I had a better paying job and wasn't in a massive amount of debt like I am now).

* I'm looking at a debt consolidation loan through a small, local credit union.  Is this wise for roughly $4k in credit card debt?  I've been employed steadily since May 2010 at my current job (so about a year and a half now - previous to that, I was living off of scholarships while trying to find a job.

l4lum,0,2011-10-07,A letter to a friend,[deleted],Proofreading,https://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/l4lum/a_letter_to_a_friend/,"Hey Reddit! I'm writing a letter to a friend in the US. English is my third language and I'd appreciate someone to proofread my letter. Just make sure grammar structure is okay and the content is not dumb (oh and the little jokes are somewhat funny too).
*****
Dear Stephanie,

It has been so long since we've talked, so I hope this letter finds you well. In fact, I know you're doing all good, I have you on Facebook, remember? I could've just written to you there, but I think a letter is better (and I recently bought this new fountain pen and I wanted to try it.. looks fancy right?)  

To be honest, I was going to write you a letter a long time ago, I promised you on in 2005 but I don't remember if I ever sent it. Anyways, how have you been? How was your summer? Mine was okay, I had a two months long internship (by the way, the logo on top of this page is where I did that), then traveled a bit before school started again. Tomorrow is the first day, and this will be my last semester before I graduate. I've went through 18 years of school, so I'm eager to finally start another era of my life, a new chapter. I'm going to be a computer engineer, making software and such. I'll work for a while and then probably go for an MBA, I'm hoping to do it in the US. That'd be great. 

Other than this, I had a dream of you last night, and that's what made me write to you today. You came to Morocco for a visit, and we met. We went to Chaouen (a touristy city in the middle of the Atlas Mountains, amidst meadows and huge grasslands). Now this city is very well known for being the biggest producer of cannabis in Morocco, so we bought some and smoked it (I don't usually smoke). We got stoned and Reese's Pieces started falling from the sky (What?). For some reason, I couldn't catch any, and neither could you. The dream started to get messed up and you disappeared somehow (and kept dreaming of myself). That's about it, haha! I just wanted to share this meaningless dream with you :)

Do you still go swimming? How's that going fo you? You should come to Morocco and try swimming in the atlantic (I know you can do that there too but it's not the same thing, our Atlantic is much cooler). 
I hope you're all good and your days are happy and full of good things.




Keep in touch,


Ali

l4821,13,2011-10-07,"Dear American Redditors,",Whatsername868,travel,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/l4821/dear_american_redditors/,"[Hello Reddit,](http://i.imgur.com/cZo9S.jpg)

I don't even know how to start this. I'm just asking right now that you read this all the way through, even though I can tell already that it's going to be extremely LONG [insert sexual joke here].

So, hi. I've been an official Redditor for over a year now (just noticed my little trophy!) - I've heard that to truly know a 'place', you need to first 'live' there for two years. Well, I'm half way there with Reddit, and I can honestly say that I feel more of an attachment to this website than I do the city I've been living in for nearly two years now. I'm what's known as an Eternal Optimist (I *promise* you that I'm not a pessimistic, depressed girl...most people describe me as ""poppy"" and ""bubbly""), but I've just recently realized that Orlando has no soul and I have not been able to find lasting happiness here no matter how many activities I throw myself into.

It's REALLY starting to weigh down on me recently though. One of my favorite things about myself is my ability to always see the bright side of life, and to be happy and positive even through dark times, so the fact that I'm starting to have a constant feeling of joylessness and unfulfillment is scaring me. That's not the kind of person I am or want to ever be. 

I wish it was possible to transfer how restless I feel through the wires and satellites right now to you. It would knock you out of your chair. Every inch of me is SCREAMING for a change, my body's quite literally been trembling the past few days, and I haven't been able to think straight because of how antsy I've been feeling.

Last night it got so intense that I was laying awake until after 3am, when I went to bed at 11pm, because this overwhelming urge to grab my car keys and just do what I feel like I've been MEANT to do for years and drive west and find myself on the way, as (candy)corny as that sounds. Crazy people do crazy things. And I have never been so close to letting the crazy overcome everything else as I was last night. The ONLY thing that kept me from packing my things was my determination to finish my Bachelor's Degree and my Internship. Yeah, there's quite a few other things that would make it pretty dang difficult, but I have a firm belief that everything works itself out if you're brave enough to follow a passion. Well, I blew flower pedals around and turned the outdoors green and beautiful in [Flower](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FRKGU9Zu_o) for an hour to calm myself down and get myself to sleep, but I still went to bed going over ways in my head that I could make traveling and making a long and life-changing adventure a reality.

...I woke up with this insane idea in my mind, that's been burning in me like fire ALL day. I want to do a **Reddit Roadtrip**. I want to get in my car, throw a tent in the trunk, grab a video camera, grab a friend, and drive from Florida to California and see every possible place and Redditor in between. I'm not a movie-maker or a video blogger, but the thought of compiling all of my filmed experiences into a documentary when it's all over just seems so good. I think it'd be fun to do short interview-like sessions with different Redditors I'd meet along the way. I'm not saying this will hit theaters or become an internationally-known film, but I think that it would be something really beautiful to create and to have done.

So, I'm posting this to ask if Redditors across America would be able to make this really happen. I guess I should be reasonable and make myself wait until at least May after I graduate, but yep (woooosh here comes the real world) I'm not exactly financially blessed and I realize that this wouldn't be as easy as my dream-filled self makes it sound. What I'm hoping is that there would be enough Redditors in cities across the country willing to take a few hours out of their day to show me around their town, sit down for a meal, and maybe lend me a couch or at least point me to a cheap hotel in the area. I love meeting people so of course this just makes me even more excited about doing this, and I'm really liking the idea of turning it into at least a video blog focusing on the Reddit-encounters that I have during my trip. So it'd kinda be like going on a very very extended Reddit meetup.

I've told a few friends about my idea, and they're only making me want to do it more. I've invited a few very close people to come with me, and one of them said ""I'd want a plan, aaaand that's more spur of the moment. Honestly, I'd have to think on it for a bit, since something like that goes against every fiber of my being. And yet that's part of the attraction."" I couldn't have put it better. I'm all for acting upon impulses and proving the impossible possible. So yeah, I would hopefully be traveling with at least one friend. 

I've been going over lots of little details too. Like, of course I'd have a Reddit bumper sticker on the car. And there'd have to be some sort of Road Trip pet. And I need to start looking for a decent video camera! I'd have to find a way to make sure I've got Reddit connections in enough cities willing to be a part of this. 

I'm an Art Education major, and one thing that I've learned in my art classes is how to not only take criticism, but how to love and appreciate receiving it. So, rip my idea apart, give me suggestions on how to make this happen, throw your cyber-shit at me, 
just DON'T tell me that it's impossible because that word is soooooo pre-Christopher Columbus. Oh, and another thing I've learned in my program is how many ideas are born every day and die because they're deemed ""too difficult"" or ""unreachable."" I am 100% confident and pretty much Hell-bent on carrying through with this idea but it really does depend on the generosity I would get from the people of Reddit. 

Totally related, [brain crack](http://www.zefrank.com/thewiki/brain_crack).

l5e31,1,2011-10-08,An internship that will make a difference,blickenlights,Jobopenings,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jobopenings/comments/l5e31/an_internship_that_will_make_a_difference/,"We're looking for a Information Technology intern to help us here at the Cape Eleuthera Institute, Island School and Deep Creek Middle School.  We’re a broad community of teachers, researchers, students, administrators, tradesmen and professionals that are working together towards a sustainable future.
As an IT intern, you’ll work as part of a small team that does it all. From Systems Administration, to our new CRM system, website maintenance to custom application development, there is much to be done everyday.  Your duties would vary from day to day, but this is very much a hands-on experience for everyone on the team. We’ll all pitch in with the daily IT responsibilities like server maintenance, but you’ll also participate in one long term project that befits your experience and goals. For instance, if you have OOP knowledge, we are building an energy monitoring system that will be our first step towards a smart campus.  As for a schedule, you’ll work 5 and ½ days a week, and may be called upon to help out in some strange hours. 
Of course, you need to live a balanced life down here.  Not every week will be filled to the brim with IT work. You may want to help out with research programs, or you may want to take the opportunity to experience everything island life has to offer: road trips, scuba diving, wind surfing, free diving, kayaking, or experience some of the most pristine beaches in the world.
In the end, a small stipend is available, but you’re not coming here for the money.  You’re coming to learn about IT, learn about sustainable living, and try and a make a difference. If this even slightly interests you, you should take a few minutes to check out our websites, youtube and blog. Our more ‘professional description’ can be found on the CEI website (www.ceibahamas.org/internships.aspx), as well as instructions for applying."
l6dd3,0,2011-10-09,Regarding Al Davis...,[deleted],nfl,https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/l6dd3/regarding_al_davis/,"Though I'm young, I'm pretty well educated on the history of the NFL.

Of course Al Davis was one of the most influential men in the history of the NFL, a true titan of the game. And of course he did things ""his way"" regardless of what anybody thought at the time. You've heard all the other buzz-words being thrown around: ""innovative"", ""maverick"", etc.

But I still find it... kind of funny that 72 hours ago the man was a punch line who almost everyone could agree had lost his way as far as managing the team, but everyone is now falling all over themselves to call the man a genius, and condemn anyone who would dare to point out that the last ~8 years of his tenure saw him overseeing a franchise that epitomized dysfunction.

I'll say it again, Al Davis was one of the most important and memorable men in the history of the NFL.

But the man was fucking crazy at the end, and I think it's bullshit to act like that's not the case now that he's gone.

Downvote away, sheep.

EDIT: Maybe I shouldn't have asked for downvotes: I can't tell if I'm getting them because I sarcastically asked for them, or if it's because I'm stating an unpopular and untimely opinion.

Here's the reality: I've only been a fan of the NFL for the last 6 years. I don't remember the glory days of the Raiders, I don't remember Al Davis taking a leading role in the AFL, I don't remember a time when Al was a revolutionary figure, but I am well aware that they happened and that they are an essential part of his legacy.

But what I *remember* is a Raiders team that has been doing, shall we say, poorly ever since 2002 and featured a lot of really questionable decisions, and stories of mistreatment of interns and vindictive personal conflict in that front office. I bear no ill will towards the man, and my condolences are with the man's family and all those who have held him dear in their hearts for his entire career.

I just have to question how everyone is parading around acting like they've been Al's staunchest supporters this past decade. Because I sure wasn't seeing many supporters 72 hours ago."

Middle class, good looking guy.  I'll make this as short as possible. I graduated from HS in 2009, good GPA, lots of athletics and extracurricular, but I didn't want to go to college for any reason other than getting the hell away from my family. I had no plan, just BS'd my family about what I ""wanted to do"" and what degree I ""wanted to get"" and go to the farthest school that would accept me on their dime, because ever since I was young, college was that step you ""have to take to be successful or be anything in life"". 

They've never asked or cared about what I wanted out of life. My dad got me to play baseball when I was 5, and as I grew up, that was the only way for me to bond with him.  Which is awful, because I was NEVER passionate about it at all. It was for him, to make him happy.  I just happened to be in the ""99 percentile for height"" when I was young, ended up 6'5"" and good at pitching.  Junior year of HS I didn't make the team because I was spending too much time practicing for the lead in the Winter Play to make tryouts. I realized walking home when I got cut that I never even liked baseball, and was only trying to make my dad happy. However, I continued to play travel leagues and go to college showcases because my dad was dropping money on it and really insisted I not ""waste my talent"".  I finally told him that I didn't want to play in college because I didn't give a shit about it and didn't even want to THINK about making a career out of it.

I get dropped off at college and end up getting involved with a girl on my floor.  I somehow pulled off a  masquerade for a year and a half.  Going to classes and getting Bs and Cs, changing my major from Premed (Dr's make a ton of money! says parents) to Business (my dad is a CFO and really pushed it), hating every fucking minute of it (other than her and selling/smoking a fuckton of weed), not paying attention in class, not reading, not doing my work, just being happy to be away from them and living on my own, wondering how the fuck anyone could be so stupid as to spend money on college (glad it wasn't mine!) but scooting by to appease them enough to keep them paying for it.  I'd gone off my depression medication (with the consent and supervision of my psychiatrist) at the end of HS to see if I could function without it (I was resentful of my illness), and I guess I did alright, albeit while self medicating with weed like crazy.  Probably smoked 3-4 grams a day (for free since I was selling).  Near the end of my 3rd semester, I suddenly realized I was living a complete lie, and if I continued with it I would be looking back and regretting every day of my life from that point on.  I started getting depressed and started taking my meds again.

When I started taking my meds again, I got a bit manic. My brain was working a million miles an hour.  I told my parents I wasn't doing what I should be for myself, and told them I wanted a career in the arts, and to come home (saving them a TON of money obviously, even though I knew I would hate living with them) and take classes at community college in music. I only think they agreed because I was at one of the most expensive private colleges in the country and was asking them to come home to community college.

Coming home might have been the biggest mistake of my life thus far.  It was absolute HELL. I broke up with my girlfriend of a year and a half because I needed to focus on myself and I knew I wouldn't be able to with her 4 states away getting drunk at ""mixers"" for her sorority all of the time. 

Back at home, I had a complete identity crisis. I ruminated for about 8 months straight on my entire life up to that point, most heavily on the previous year and a half. I was deeply suicidal, and to make matters worse, it was fucking IMPOSSIBLE to reintegrate into my home.  My sister was failing HS due to truancy, substance abuse, and was stealing all of the time, so my parents were already on edge with her when I came home, but the difference in dynamics between myself and them blew completely out of proportion.  They treated me like a fucking 5 year old and constantly told me how I was fucking up and not doing enough.  I was already going through mental hell for having made so many wrong decisions and feeling like shit about my gf (who I got word from just about everyone I knew up at Uni was fucking frat dudes within a week of me breaking up with her. breaking up was my decision, I broke her heart, it was the right decision since she's well on her way to becoming an alcoholic and I never should have met her in the first place, but it still hurt me to the fucking core. I'd had girlfriends in HS, and had sex before, but this girl and I LIVED TOGETHER on the same floor for a year, saw each other every day during the summer between because she had an internship in my state, and down the street from each other the following semester ), and a crisis of the self.  

Here I was, saving them a FUCKTON of money, trying to make sure I go down the path that will make me the happiest, intentionally ending relationships and leaving ""camp"" (as I've come to consider college), and all they can do is tell me how easy I have it, how much more mature they were when they were my age, how little drive and ambition I have, how I just need to 'pick something and go for it!"".

within 3 weeks I had told them I would go back to Uni and finish a CS degree (the internet is only growing and compnaies will never stop needing coders!) (even though coding is interesting, I would HATE to do it for a long time or for a career) in the next two years. Obviously not something I wanted, though I could do it, it was just to get away and make them happy. And I knew it.  This threw me even deeper into my depression.  I was on meds and sleeping 20 hours a day, suicidal, obsessing over my ex and ruminating all day long. I can't even begin to explain how exhausting it was physically, mentally, and emotionally, even though I was barely doing anything but being completely inert.  

I went back up to uni in august and literally stayed in bed for three weeks, smoking weed, drinking, doing oxy (sometimes when I drank, obviously retarded), and completely suicidal.  I called my parents and told them I was going to kill myself, and they flew me home and stuck me in a PHP (patial hospitalization program).  The program gave me a lot of space to talk about what I was feeling, and though that helped A BIT, it obviously didn't solve anything, and only made me more anxious about my future, and my parents are still on my fucking ass all day every day about where I'm going and what I'm going to do next.  I can't seem to get them to understand how fucked up I really am right now, and how afraid I am of starting up again too fast and falling into this again.

During my nihilistic existential crisis, when I was ruminating on my entire life, I came to a conclusion about what made ME happy, and where in my life I'd done things for myself and really felt accomplished.  The only place I'd ever done that was theater. Acting. I love it.  Music as well, but I never got the chance to learn an instrument (my dad only knew sports and I could never quit baseball when I was younger and he was always talking about how much money he'd spent on it, even though it didn't make me happy and wasn't what I wanted), and now I defintiely don't have the time to be fucking around with one when I need to get started on a career. I'm a serious internet addict, and spent countless hours researching actors and comedians who dropped out of college and made a go of it and made it.  The ones that really clicked with me were James Franco and Zach Galifinakis.  JF dropped out of UCLA against his parents wishes, lived in his cars and on the docks until her got a pizza commercial spot, then Freaks and Geeks, then James Dean, then Spiderman, and boom he was a working actor. The guy is set for life now, and can live it how he wants. Zach Galifinakis didn't want to go to college, he always wanted to act, parents made him go to college, he graduated, came home and had an existential crisis, moved to NY and started trying to make it as an actor, had bit parts, met a girl that got him into comedy, boom, now he's a comedian and actor.  I've tried showing my parents people who take different routes to success, but they're so pragmatic and set in the ways of society it's fruitless.

I've got about $2000 (had more but I got robbed and my parents have quit paying for a lot of things and have been bitching about how much food I eat so I keep buying my own groceries), I'm thinking about buying a van, throwing the essentials and clothes in it, and driving to LA to try to make it as an actor. I'll siphon gas along the way if I have to, beg or suck dick for food if I have to, and when I get there I'll take part time jobs for the rest of my life if I have to just to get by. I can't stand looking at my parents every day knowing they care enough to not let me kill myself, but I know deep inside they are let down and not proud of me. Hell, I can't even look in the fucking mirror without wanting to go out and buy a gun and blow my brains out half the time.

The only thing keeping me from doing this is my medication and my parents.  I couldn't get the car without them somehow knowing, and they're so fucking intent on making sure I go to a college and  finish a degree. They dont understand that I can't just do it the way everyone expects people to and still be happy. The other thing is, if I drove away, I wouldn't be able to refill my medication (no money/no job to make money... yet...) and I know first hand already how debilitated I would become if I just stopped or ran out.  I don't know if I can stay here any longer though.


Do I just need to take control? "
l5kf4,45,2011-10-08,Two Nights,fatche,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/l5kf4/two_nights/,"When I look back on my life (I'm in my 30s now), there are two days that always stand out. Twelve years ago, I was an intern at a magazine and an undergrad studying journalism. My office was full of beautiful women, and there are 4 or 5 stories I love to relive. But the king-hell best of them all involved myself, a fellow intern, a managing editor, and a Jesus freak.

I'm not what you would consider an extremely gorgeous man. I've always had a little pot belly (beer and weed takes its toll) and I didn't work out very often. However, I was voted ""fifth most fuckable guy"" out of about 30 or 40 guys by a panel of my female peers in college. So, I guess I'm pleasant to look at but I'm no Dicaprio. 

I have always been attracted to unusual-looking women (unusual as in tattoos, piercings, unique, etc). Jeanna, one of my managing editors, was very unique. She had a very eastern-European look, very skinny...the kind of girl who may seem hot to someone but only average to another. She was hot to me, and I wanted to fuck her from the first day I met her. She had a boyfriend (I forget his name) and we use to hang out and double date. I liked them both, so she was off limits to me. We all seemed to march to a different beat, blah blah...you get the idea.

Friday afternoon was always crazy at the office since we were usually rushing to get proofs out to the printer. This particular Friday was no different. Around 6:30p, Jeanna walked into my cubicle and asked if I'd like to tag along tonight since this week had been hell for everyone. I was tired, but felt like a good drunk to blow off steam. I agreed with vague conditions. 

Around 7:30 or so, I packaged the last proof and dropped it in the outbox. Jeanna had been finished 10 minutes or so before me and the plan was to meet at one of our favorite pubs. I jumped in my car, and took off.

Around 7:50, I made it to the pub. There was a great local band and it was the kind of place where we knew just about everyone there, including the owner. We had a great time. By around 2 or 2:30a, we had become separated - me talking with other friends/coworkers and Jeanna and her guy doing the same, or so I thought.

Around 3am, I'd begun to get tired and the bar was closing. I began to look for my friends. Before I could find them, Jeanna's boyfriend approached me and asked if I'd see her. I hadn't. He looked worried. He asked me to help and I did. We looked in every nook and cranny of the pub, which was starting to thin out. No Jeanna. We walked outside and sat on the curb. After a few moments of uneasy silence, I suggested we walk to the car. Maybe she was waiting for us. 

On the way to the car, I learned that Jeanna had been missing for more than 2 hours. I simply hadn't noticed as I was engrossed in catching up with a few friends I hadn't seen in a while. The walk was short and in a few minutes, we could see the parking lot. It was hard to tell from a distance, but we both noticed someone standing in an awkward position next to the car. We walked faster. 

As we approached the car, I was shocked at what I saw. A tall, well-groomed black guy was standing facing the opened backseat-passenger door. It was obvious to me, at least, that he was thrusting his crouch at something inside. A few seconds later, Jeanna's guy realized what was happening. He quietly ran up to the back window, with me not far behind. Jeanna was lying in the back seat, shirt pulled over breasts, pants and panties missing, with some slightly-chubby girl's face buried in her crouch. The black guy was standing outside banging the chubby white girl. A stranger to me, the other girl had dark, medium-length hair. She was wearing a shirt, and I could see her pants and panties down around her knees. The other guy was pounding her pretty good. So much so that none of them noticed us sneaking up behind them. 

Jeanna was rubbing her breasts and I could hear her moaning. The only other sound was the black guys balls slapping against the chubby girl. Moments later I heard my friend scream, “Jeanna, what the fuck are you doing?” The panic that ensued still makes the hair on my neck stand. Jeanna's eyes popped open, the black dude  - in what was a truly impressive display – pulled out, pulled up his pants, and was gone into the darkness in an instant. The other girl took her time, putting her clothes back on. My friend, a constant scream of profanities coming from his mouth, opened the other back door, grabbed Jeanna by the arms and flung her out of the car. Her panties were still around her knees. I think the most exciting moment was seeing her pussy for the first time. I'll never forget it...neatly trimmed, surrounded by her bony thighs and flat belly. Her boyfriend grabbed her by the arms and pulled her up violently. I thought he was going to hit her, but instead, he screamed and cussed. At the same time, she begged and pleaded with him, her tiny bare ass still in full view. I had no idea what to do or say. So I just turned back and headed for my car, which was on the other side of the parking lot. Their screaming became more and more faint as I walked. By the time I reached my car, I could barely hear them. I drove home. For the rest of the night, every time I closed my eyes, I saw Jeanna's pussy and ass.

The next day passed without a word from either of them. This wasn't my business so why would they involve me? Sometime in the early evening, I got a call from Jeanna. I didn't answer the first time...I really hate drama. But I did listen to her voice message...something about apologizing for last night. She also asked me if I was going to a party being thrown by our newest intern. I had forgotten about it. She seemed pretty down. Honestly, after seeing her half naked, I was kind of hoping my chances with her had improved. I liked her boyfriend, but I wasn't exactly close with him. I called her back about 30 min later. She asked me if I wouldn't mind taking her to the party. I knew better, but agreed anyway. 

Sunday night is not a good time to throw a party, especially when people like me and Jeanna are invited guests. I am a pretty quiet, mild-mannered guy at work, but when I'm at a private party with friends, I tend to overdo it. This particular night was no exception. 

We arrived at the intern's house - I'll call her Sarah since I also don't remember her name – around 8pm. There were some pretty cool people from a local university there and we were having a great time. Around 11pm, a couple of guys arrived. One was the boyfriend of a hot redhead who had been at the party before we arrived. The other was a portly, short sidekick. I knew they were trouble from the moment I looked at them. They seemed nervous and irritated. 

The two guys changed the atmosphere of the place almost immediately. The people I had just met left pretty quickly. I stayed because Jeanna wasn't ready to leave. We spent the next couple of hours drinking heavily. I drank a large bottle of Alazea, a 12-pack of Corona, and several gin and tonics. I was hammered and soon passed out on the couch, despite the loud conversation and music. 

I awoke an hour or so later. I don't remember the time. But I do remember the place was very quiet. No one was in the room with me. I felt the urge to hurl and tried to find the bathroom. With no luck, I opened the bedroom door and headed for the only bathroom in the apartment. When you have to puke, you have to puke, and even the sight of 3 naked hotties locked in a mouth to pussy orgy couldn't make me stop. I slammed the door behind me and did the big spit. 

Feeling much better, I walked out of the bathroom to see if I'd hallucinated. Sure enough, Jeanna, the redheaded girl, and a brunette were all chained together in some perfect triangle orgy. I didn't feel invited, so I apologized and headed for the bedroom door. Jeanna and the brunette stopped munching for a moment and yelled at me to not leave. What a pushover I am. I sat down in a chair near the door. I hadn't even noticed the two guys were sitting near the bed watching the spectacle with unwavering attention. The intern throwing the party was giving the short portly guy a BJ while the other guy was just staring at the girls. From between the redhead's legs, Jeanna said to me, “You can come closer if you want.” I obliged her. I was now mere feet from something I'd only seen in porn films. It was then that I noticed the taller guy was fucking his girlfriend (redhead) with a blue dildo. I hadn't gotten too good of a look at her all night, but at that moment she seemed pretty hot to me. She wasn't gorgeous, but she had that pale skin and very dark, red hair. She was a pretty girl. The brunette had short, medium hair and reminded me of a less beautiful version of the Italian-Greek girl Michael Corleon married in the second Godfather movie. These were not the kind of girls I would choose, but they were certainly fuckworthy. 

About 10 min later, the taller guy removed the dildo from his girlfriend's vagina, and slowly, cautiously started to rub Jeanna's ass with it. She realized this and looked toward him. He stopped. A few moments later, he did it again. This time, Jeanna told him to stop. But he was not easily deterred. He tried again, this time penetrating her. She jerked and whirled around at him. She said, “Stop fucking doing that, asshole,” or something to that effect. He snarled back something like, “You know you like it.” This pissed me off. I told him to leave Jeanna alone, that she was my friend and if she wanted his help, she would ask for it. He, of course, told me to fuck off...and the fat was in the fire. To summarize, he said I didn't need to be there. Jeanna and both of the other girls called him a hypocrite and said I had as much right as any one else. He shutup. 

He must have been too drunk or too stupid, because he tried it again. This time, I'd had enough. I didn't wait for Jeanna to voice her displeasure. I stood up and told him to step outside. He stared at me for a second. Then he said, “Do you want to start something?” I replied, “You already did.” 

Outside I drew closer to him and said, “You're drunk and you need to leave.” By this time, the girls had stopped and were talking amongst themselves. I reached my head in the door and told them all to stay in the room. 

I told the guy once more to leave. He refused and put his nose in my face, threatening me to back up my words. Longer story shortened, we exchanged a few more words, and he pushed me. I pushed him back and he fell on his ass. He got up, fists ready and took a wild swing at me. I dodged it easily and hit him right between the ribs. He grabbed his stomach and bent over. I grabbed his head and uppercut his nose with my knee. He was out cold. I left him there, bleeding. I stood there for a minute wondering what I should do. About that time, his stubby little friend came out of the bedroom. “What the fuck happened?” he asked. I told him, “Your friend took a swing at me and I put him down. I think you need to take him home.” The guy actually apologized. I helped him carry his friend out to a car. I never saw them again.

I went back into the bedroom, testosterone and adrenaline pumping. The redhead asked me what had happened. I said, “Nothing, everything is fine.” Jeanna looked at me and smiled. I sat back down as if to say, “Okay, you can continue.” Jeanna got off the bed and walked over to me. Her small beasts were covered in freckles and her nipples were purple and raised. She was completely naked. I could see the dried moisture on her inner thigh reflecting off what little light there was in the room. Her body seemed very teenish. Only her face gave away her age. She almost tripped over the new intern who had passed out at some point. She took my hand and led me over to the bed. Jeanna has always been use to being in control. I bet she had orchestrated, or at least encouraged the events of that night.

Jeanna sat on the edge of the bed and pulled me down next to her. The smell of pussy, alcohol, and weed was quite strong. The other girls were lying next to each other waiting to see what Jeanna would do. To my surprise – and also delight – she grabbed by crouch. I lurched a bit and gave her a confused look. She gave me this spiel about how she had always noticed the way I looked at her, and she knew I wanted to fuck her. But first, I would have to do something for her. 

At this point in the story, people start thinking that I'm making shit up. And this is not an easy story to tell. But know this: I am not exaggerating. In fact, I'm trying to keep it as realistic as possible. Jeanna is a crazy, sexy, constantly-horny bitch. Anyway, I waited in abject shock. 

The first thing she said – pointing to the brunette – was, “I want you to give her an orgasm.” I sat there terrified. “I'll show you how.” Jeanna laid down on her belly, spread the girl's legs apart, and put her mouth over the brunette girl's vagina. Her mouth was covering the entire opening. Soon, the brunette was moaning quietly, which meant to me that Jeanna was tonguing her. Then, she took one of my fingers. “Put it inside her.” I obeyed. I remember her slick opening and how my finger was so close to Jeanna's mouth. I slid it inside and started fingering her slowly. The girl began to arch her back a little. Jeanna was guiding my hand haphazardly in and out. All the time swiftly brushing her tongue across her clit. 

A few minutes of this and the brunette was moaning louder. Then, Jeanna stopped and lifted herself to my eye level. She smiled and put her hand behind my head and pulled me down onto the girl's pussy. I started flicking my tongue back and forth. I thought I away doing pretty well until Jeanna corrected me. ”You have to put your mouth over her.” She must have been about half way there because within 3 or 4 minutes, she was cumming. She grunted and lurched causing my lip to bang into my teeth slightly. I started to raise up and Jeanna pushed me down gently, “She's not finished yet.” I kept on until the brunette pushed my head away and closed her legs with her fingers covering her vagina.

By this point, I was feeling much more confident, and my drunk was getting to be less of a burden. I reached for Jeanna and she took my hands. “Not yet”, she said. “I want you to take off you clothes.” I did. Then, all three girls stared at my quickly hardening penis. I've never been proud, but that night, despite my BAL, all of my 7-8 inches stood at attention like never before. Jeanna looked at the redhead, who'd been content to simply watch and play with her pussy. “I want you to suck his cock.” The redhead smiled and didn't hesitate. She slid over to me and grabbed the tip of my cock. And then started licking the underside of the tip. In a few minutes, I was adequately wet from her saliva. Then she took me into her mouth. I'd eaten girls out before, and had a few blowjobs, but this was the single most terrifying and enjoyable sexual experience of my life. The redhead pushed my chest down, causing me to lay flat on the bed. Jeanna sat and watched on one side, while the brunette started fingering herself again. 

I've never been easy to get off from BJs. I enjoy them, but it takes more for me to climax. After another minute or so, Jeanna became impatient and gently pulled the redhead off my cock. “Now, I want you to fuck her.” Did I mention my confidence had swelled? I took the girl by the arm and stretched her out beside me., knowing that this might be my only obstacle to fucking Jeanna. My assertiveness caught her by surprise I guess, because she halfheartedly resisted saying, “I have a boyfriend!” Jeanna, undeterred by this admission, moved closer to her and said, “Didn't you tell me you'd love to fuck his brains out? Come on, you know you want it!” The girl smiled but reiterated, “But I love him...I don't want to cheat on my boyfriend.” Jeanna said, “No one's gonna know.” Then, Jeanna grabbed one of her legs and spread it open. “Fuck her hard.” I think gradually, she became a little more comfortable, but with reservations. She asked if I had a condom, but Jeanna replied, “Fuck condoms...we're all on the pill.” Regardless, I penetrated her and slowly started fucking her. Jeanna moved up to the head of the bed and started rubbing the girl's chest, tweaking her nipples. They were creamy white with puffy, pink aureola. There were lots of red freckles...very sexy. 

After 30 seconds or so, I starting thrusting harder. I grabbed the part just below her knee and raised it up so that her calfs were resting on my shoulders. Every once in a while, Jeanna would say, “Come on, fuck her...make her cum!” At one point she said, “This guy just kicked your boyfriend's ass and now he's fucking you hard! I think you might have a new boyfriend now!” This sent me into a frenzy. I was nailing her so hard, the bed started to creak, and every few strokes or so, the headboard would knock against the wall. The redhead was panting and moaning. I let go of one of her legs and started flicking her clit with my thumb as my cock disappeared and reappeared just as quickly. Jeanna voiced her approval. This made the redhead moan louder and more frequently. I heard her whimper, “Fuck mem fuck me!” She tensed up and started holding her breath. I knew she was trying to cum. So I fucked her even harder, rubbing her clit with my thumb. At first, I would rub it with every stroke. But now, my thumb was rubbing her clit 2 or 3 times for every stroke. As she came, every muscle in her chest tightened...I could see the veins in her neck flex. She shuttered violently, but without a sound from her mouth. I sunk my cock inside her deep, holding it in and rubbing her clit furiously. I could feel the end of my cock bend a little as it met her wall. Her reaction was not a moan, but rather a deep, growling grunt. This morphed into a scream that rattled the walls of the room. It seriously hurt my ears. I'd never seen a girl cum like that before. I'd also never fucked like that. The redhead's eyes were still closed and her face and chest were flush as she shuttered and lurched back a forth. I was close to cumming, so I pulled back from deep inside and started fucking her again. This brought on another orgasm...and another. Soon, she began to whimper and her breathing was deeper than ever. I heard her say in a half-whimper, half-whisper, “Don't cum in me....don't cum in me.” Jeanna replied, “It's ok, fill the bitch up.” The redhead whimpered faintly, “No, cum on my stomach.” As I realized I was a few seconds away, I really began to pound her. Ignoring her, I looked down at her pussy as I came. It was red and swollen...her clit was twice its normal size. I gasped and slowed down but continued fucking her deep...all the way to her wall. I could feel the place where it stopped and it made me feel good to know I was too big for her. I pulled out and string of semen stretched from her clit to the tip of my penis. She lay there, still shuttering but now she was finally coming down from it all. 

I fell backward and collapsed on the bed. I glanced at the clock and was amazed to realize only about 25 or 30 minutes had passed. The redhead, having regained her senses, rather hurriedly left the bed and went into the bathroom. My eyes followed. “Is she okay?”, I asked as she closed the door behind her. Jeanna replied, “She'll be fine. She's a Jesus freak.” 

I laid there, trying to catch my breath. Jeanna got up and went to the bathroom door. The brunette followed and opened the door. She walked in, but Jeanna stayed outside. I could hear them talking in hushed tones. I thought I heard the redhead sniffle. Again, in summary, the party ended and the redhead had a crisis of conscious in the kitchen. Jeanna, the brunette, and the new intern were surrounding her, trying to offer comfort. It was one of those lame come-aparts that plague the intensely religious. I talked with her, told her we were just having fun and that I hoped I hadn't hurt or violated her. Amazingly, she was not angry or upset with me. She even laughed and said she'd never been fucked like that and she was glad it happened. Why such a overtly religious girl was in the middle of a three-way lesbian orgy that led to a three-way fuckfest beats the hell out of me. 

My only disappointment that night was not getting to fuck Jeanna. Whipping that guys ass and then fucking and cuming inside his girlfriend (of 4 years I later learned) was the hottest thing I ever did. Well, almost. Jeanna and I had a few more adventured together. But I will save them for another time.

l6pq8,7,2011-10-10,How are minimum wage workers not being exploited?,kylesaisgone,Anarcho_Capitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/l6pq8/how_are_minimum_wage_workers_not_being_exploited/,"I've made a few posts in and around r/libertarian about how I've begun to change my views, and one of them has to do with exploitation theory. When I was a Rothbardian, I rejected the idea that workers could be 'exploited', or that businesses who did exploit workers would eventually go underwater. I've been working at Dunkin Donuts for about 6 months now, and I'm starting to question my thoughts on how low-wage workers are treated. Let me preface by saying that I'm an extremely strong-willed person, with an incredible work ethic. I internalize my work; that is, I take great pride in what becomes the end result of my work. That being said, I can't help but think fastfood workers (I've worked other minimum wage jobs where I didn't feel like I was being 'exploited') are being exploited. I work 50+ hours a week, sometimes 6 days a week (For the month of August, I worked a grand total of about ~170 hours) and the work is so fucking degrading. People walk all the fuck over you all goddamn day, you're *constantly* being rushed because they never hire enough people to cover the shift because of how ridiculously cheap they are, and at my store (not sure how other stores are) fucking *EVERYTHING* is broken. Everything is clogged, the espresso machine doesn't properly steam milk, the coolatta machines are filthy, the milk machines break down every other day, the pipes clog, and overflow... I could go on for days. My boss never orders enough stuff to get us through the week (Going back to how incredibly cheap they are) and we end up selling people food they don't even know is basically not what they ordered. Today we were giving people food wrapped in wax paper because we ran out of the stupid sleeves you put food in. We mix the decaf and the regular coffee in the grinder because we were almost out of regular. I went to A&amp;P to buy bacon off the shelves, cooked it in the TurboChef, and sold it to customers, not even sure if it was properly cooked or not. Apparently an entire colony of food flies has invaded the backroom. We never have enough donuts at night. I literally haven't scratched the surface of the problems that arise throughout a typical day at Dunkin Donuts, and the worst part is, I work with a bunch of people who have 6-7+ years working at various Dunkin Donuts, and they say it's the same everywhere. The girl I closed with is one of the hardest working women I've met in my life, and literally gets one day off a month between her three jobs, and she's a supervisor at a local McDonalds. She says it's no different there. 

My job wouldn't be half bad if we ordered everything properly, made enough food/donuts, and employed enough people. I've complained a few times, but my complaints get met with something to shut me up temporarily. I don't know what it is, but apparently ordering an extra box of lids so you don't run out on Wednesday after your shipment came on Monday, is akin to bloody murder in fastfood. After the first ~3 months, I figured we were going through a temporary period of instability, because 2 people had just left, and that once the schedule smoothed out, and we eased into Summer, things would get more stable. Maybe my boss would figure out how many cups to order, and maybe he'd hire new people. Never happened. I started talking to some of the people who'd been working in fastfood for a while (Despite Libertarian orthodoxy, practically everyone I've worked with in fastfood are immigrants who will be working there for pretty much the rest of their lives; contra the claim that only young, inexperienced kids work fastfood) and they all say it's the same everywhere you go. 

It amazes me, because people think Dunkin Donuts is a well-run place. The regulars all come in, and they love us. They think everything is just peachy at the Dunkin. At the end of the day, I can't help but feel the workers, as well as the customers, are being exploited. I've served so many cups of coffee to people, who thought they were getting what they ordered, but secretly, it was maybe half decaf, or I secretly gave them extra milk to make it look like cream. Going back to what I said earlier, I take pride in my work. I've had a hard life, but I've always put 110% into my work, and it shows. I haven't been working there that long, and I already have my own set of customers that come to me specifically to make their coffee. I feel like a fucking jerkoff lying to hundreds of people. It probably sounds really petty to a lot of people, but it's true. I've been so stressed out lately, and my jaw is constantly in pain from the stress. I'm on the verge of quitting, because it's really not worth it anymore, which also makes me feel like a jerkoff, because once I leave that place, I know it's going to be chaotic, and I'm going to put undue stress on my fellow employees who I've become good friends with, but I just feel completely used and abused after spending just a few months there, and it's not like I'm some privileged fucking yuppie, I've done hard labor for family members, and done so without so much as a second thought. Some of the people who work there, have no choice but to stay there, or starve, and you can tell it's messing with them, mentally. 

Sure, there are people in fastfood who give the industry a bad name; lots of lazy teenagers, and no-lifers who don't do anything, but with the recession, I think that's changed, as fastfood places are only hiring more experienced workers (aka people who've worked in fastfood before, and are desperate for a job).

Before anyone says it; Sure, I could have left at any time, if it was so bad. Trust me, that thought has weighed heavy on my mind since the beginning of August, but like I said earlier, I didn't think the chaos at my workplace was permanent. I figured it was temporary because we had lost a few bodies, and it was the beginning of the end of a new season, and naturally some adjustments had to be made. Now that it's fall, I'm beginning to see that this chaos is nothing but ordinary. I also couldn't have left at an earlier time because I live in a small town and it was basically the only job within walking distance (I was sold a lemon by a shady car dealer, and had to save up to buy a new car). I just bought a car recently, and now my prospects will definitely be rearranged, but I can't help but feel bad for leaving, because I've literally been one of the few points of stability in that godforsaken restaurant. I fully expect my boss to suck my dick to keep me, but it's too much.

The entire structure of a fastfood business, or really, any managerial sort of hierarchy, especially fastfood, seems exploitative, really. Every order of employee, from me, to my boss, to my boss' boss, up until you reach a certain point, seem to be getting exploited. I have to meet my boss' demands, who gets those demands sent down by a higher up, and my boss' boss gets his orders from some other managerial-level boss, all the way down from the board and the CEO. The corporate model directly mirrors the delegative leadership style in Government. This type of hierarchy allows the bosses up in their offices to make the so-called 'hard decisions', but they delegate the responsibility to lower-rung managers, who have to fire/hire people, and make sure the executives are satisfied, meanwhile the executives don't get their hands dirty, and make (literally) all the money. If my boss doesn't follow his orders, he gets fired, and if I don't follow mine, I get fired. There's so much bureaucracy and pointless rules and regulations, that it really seems like I'm working at a Government agency sometimes. The amount of money my store brings in, is absolutely disgusting. I don't even want to list it publicly, but it really is staggering the amount of money my store makes on a weekly basis, and they're too cheap to make sure we're properly staffed, properly stocked, and that all the equipment works properly. Tell me ancaps, how is this not exploitation on some level or another? People like me can (Oh, and I will, trust me) quit, but there will be an endless crowd of people who will just fill in the spot because they're fucking desperate. 

Also, I think paying people shitty money is justified in some situations. If I'm going to do a work-study program, or say, an internship, I think getting paid shit wages is perfectly justified. You're getting experience in return. But fastfood and similar jobs is nothing but shittiness piled ontop of shittiness, and only exists because there's so many desperate people out there. 

What say you? Anyone have similar experiences? "

l8j0f,5,2011-10-11,I'm a CS Alumnus looking for CS/SE/Math interns for Summer 2012 at Boeing in Seattle,BoeKnows,ritforhire,https://www.reddit.com/r/ritforhire/comments/l8j0f/im_a_cs_alumnus_looking_for_cssemath_interns_for/,"Hey RIT, I'm back again. [Here was the post I made last year.](http://www.reddit.com/r/rit/comments/dntnv/im_a_cs_alumni_looking_for_cssemath_interns_for/). I felt it was successful enough to give it another go.

----

I'm a 2009 CS grad and I've been working at The Boeing Company since graduation. My boss has asked me to find us an intern for next summer (I did 2 co-op blocks here before joining full time).

I figured I'd come to Reddit first because I'm more likely to find the kind of people we're looking for here.

So, we're looking for someone studying computer science or software engineering, but math and systems engineering work too if you have good programming skills.

We do R&amp;D in artificial intelligence/optimization - mostly route planning and decision making tools - a lot of traveling-salesman type problems. You should know some AI, definitely some graph theory, have a good working knowledge of ""big o"" notation, those sorts of things.

You should also have really strong communication skills. Our interns have had a good share of independence (that is: I won't be micromanaging you, though I'm always super happy to help tackle a hard problem), so it'll be crucial that you can explain to me what you've done with the problem we've given you. I really look for this and I know my manager does too.

A few examples of the kinds of things we do:

* We're going out to Oregon to fly a ScanEagle UAV with some of the routing software we've written for it
* We're developing some ship routing software for large cargo ships, and we've had to ride the ships with our software while we tested it
* I worked on a smartphone app to help emergency responders deal with large scale disaster scenarios (I got to ride around on a police boat while we tested it in a mock scenario)

Boeing is an extremely cool company - we do so many more things than just commercial airplanes (in fact, I've never had anything to do with our commercial airplanes... go figure). Our internships are excellent - they pay competitively, and they typically pay to help you relocate.

My group is great and I really love what I do - I'm legitimately excited to go to work on most days.

Also, summer in Seattle is the best. It's sunny and 75 degrees every day. I love it here.

So, if you're interested (or know someone who is)... here's the **[job requisition](https://jobs.boeing.com/JobSeeker/JobView?reqcode=11-1018466)**.

If you're going to apply, you should PM me your name first so that I can watch for your resume when it comes. If you're uncomfortable giving out your name over Reddit, just create an alt or ask me for my Boeing email address and you can send it there.

If anyone has any questions (about me, the job, Seattle, anything at all), just leave them in the comments or PM me and we can talk more.

Thanks Reddit!"

l7t7x,6,2011-10-10,I could use some advice,[deleted],Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/l7t7x/i_could_use_some_advice/,"I have been a Christian all my life and have hardly ever questioned my religious views. I have had an amazing childhood with loving and caring parents, and wonderful opportunities given to me. Last summer I had an amazing experience at a summer internship, which I felt (then) was most certainly God's hand guiding my life.

Then, one day over the summer I began thinking about death and dying, and how short and fragile our lives really are. Naturally, that progressed to me wondering what happens to us when we die and led me to eventually question my faith itself. For months now, I've been almost constantly spinning in circles trying to reassure myself of my faith and then doubting God exists at all. I have been praying constantly about this issue but I just can't seem to make any headway.

In an ideal world I would love to just be able to see some sign that I could know for sure God is real, and everything promised us in the bible is true. Unfortunately, being the very rational minded person that I am, a real-life discussion with God seems to be about the only thing that would for sure ease my mind, and I know this just doesn't seem to happen, or at least, not in the way that I want it to happen. My question for you all is this, have any of you gone through a similar crisis, and if so, what advice would you give in working through this anxiety about death and the reality of God? And of course, your prayers would be appreciated.


EDIT: Thank you all for your responses, you have given me a lot to think about and I really appreciate you taking time to give me your advice"

So I graduated from UVa in May 2010 with a Computer Engineering degree and had two summer internships as a Network Engineer at Sprint Nextel and Bombardier Transportation. I'm now working at a company that basically refuses to place me in a Network Engineer role (even though I was told when I took the job that I'd get the chance to at least interview for it) and I'm so frustrated.

My main problem that I have is my experience bracket. I'm too ""old"" for a college hire program but am too young for most positions that require at least 3 years of experience. The irony with this is that I can't gain any new experience without being in a Network Engineer role! (Excluding my internships, which I've found most places don't count.) I also can't get security clearance because I have a lot of foreign relations with Canada. (This is basically a death sentence in the DC Area, I've come to find out... so dumb.)

I've literally had four jobs that fell through because of contractor companies losing contracts at the last second or I was denied an interim security clearance. It's been a very frustrating venture for me. I've submitted my resume to multiple sites but haven't heard back from anyone in months other than those that fell through. (Not that they were bad either - CDW and DISA among them.)

I prefer a telecommunications company but I'd be okay with an IT contracting company in a full-time position, provided that they're looking for someone in a network engineer role.

As for leaving Northern Virginia, I'm tired of the worst-in-the-nation traffic (yes, we beat the I-35 corridor for ""amount of time delay during rush hour"" on nearly all of our roads), the high rent ($1000+ with roommates per person is considered a spectacular deal), and the downright rude people (remember that I'm Canadian?)

Can anyone out there help? Even the name and telephone number/email of a recruiter would help me out. I'm just trying to get back to a job that I love. I'd especially prefer Time Warner because [I see there's a Network Engineer position open there now...](http://gotaf.socialtwist.com/redirect?l=28evq)

l9q8n,212,2011-10-12,"Hey trees, I found an AWESOME way to vent about marijuana legalization",Whatserface,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/l9q8n/hey_trees_i_found_an_awesome_way_to_vent_about/,"So I sent my congressman an e-mail (state of GA) about legalizing marijuana. I don't have what I wrote, but I got a response. I wrote him back, and in what I wrote, I cited the entire response he gave me. (Didn't want to be repetitive)

""Dear Mr. Chambliss, you sent me this e-mail in response to an e-mail I sent you about marijuana legalization:
'Dear Ms. Whatserface:
 
Thank you for taking the time to contact me regarding legalizing marijuana.  I appreciate hearing from you.
According to research by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, marijuana use has negative effects on the cardiovascular system, the lungs, the brain, and even social behavior.  The main active chemical in marijuana is THC (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol).  Scientists have learned a great deal about how THC acts in the brain to produce its many effects.  When someone smokes marijuana, THC rapidly passes from the lungs into the bloodstream, which carries the chemical to organs throughout the body, including the brain.  Studies have indicated that a user's risk of heart attack more than quadruples in the first hour after smoking marijuana. Marijuana use also has the potential to promote cancer of the lungs and other parts of the respiratory tract because it contains irritants and carcinogens. In fact, marijuana smoke contains 50 to 70 percent more carcinogenic hydrocarbons than does tobacco smoke.  Furthermore, marijuana use has also been linked to social disorders such as depression, anxiety, and personality disturbances. 

At a time when illegal drug use is a major problem for many Americans, legalizing marijuana would send the wrong message to young people across our nation that marijuana is not harmful.  I do not believe marijuana should be legalized.'

   My first response is, how can scientists in America do a great deal of research on a drug they're not allowed to research for ethical reasons? Second, have these tests been done by scientists with a neutral opinion on the matter, or rather by those from alcohol and pharmaceutical companies who have in their best interest that marijuana be illegal? And in your response you mentioned that a great deal of research has been done to prove the negative effects, completely ignoring the world of other legitimate medical journals that state the opposite of your claims. It is simply NOT TRUE that cigarettes have more carcinogenic hydrocarbons than cannabis. The only ones found in cannabis are found in anything that gets burned. You can decrease those by filtering them through water. And somehow smoking cigarettes is legal. Can you explain that to me? I really don't understand that one. 
   In fact, you make a large amount of claims without citing a single, neutral source. Why should I take a canned response, the same response in fact that the government has been trying to spoon feed its country for years, when it has no basis in reality? 
   I'd also like to call into question the statement that legalizing cannabis would send the wrong message to young people in this country. YOUR JOB is not to send messages to teenagers about morals. You are serving your constituency. This country was founded on the principles of individual freedom, and your job is to make that possible, not to limit freedoms. It should not be up to you, or the government, how I choose to have my NON-HARMFUL (yes, cannabis is in fact, not harmful) fun. People that enjoy alcohol are free to do so. People that enjoy cigarettes and cigars, are also free to do so. The effects of these are understood and the limitations are in effect for young people.
   If what you're doing is trying to protect young people, then it is in your very best interest to inform them correctly, and create legislation that protects them but does not restrict the freedoms of the people in our country.
   I am a part of your constituency. This issue is very near and dear to my heart, and the hearts of millions of others. My vote greatly depends on your attitude towards this issue.

Also, you did not respond to me about how you feel about voting because of what your people want as opposed to voting how the corporations who give you money want. I think it's pretty clear how you stand, but just for reference, can you tell me which corporations fund your campaigns and other forms of ""donations""? Can you also tell me if they affect your actions in office? I'm very curious.

Thank you for your time,
Whatserface""

Okay so 
1. r/trees, I want to keep e-mailing him. Can you help me find the right medical journals and other resources to send him so that I can appropriately combat his canned responses?
2. okay so to the point of the title... the awesome way to vent about this stuff is EMAIL YOUR CONGRESSMAN! It's pretty easy... google searches, they all have a dumbass website. Just be skeptical and reasonable, and only a little vicious (like don't curse and use memes and be a jerk...). If everyone does this, it might not make an immediate difference, but at the very least you can vent and at the very most it's a congressman! If each one gets awesome sources and arguments, maybe we can change their minds. Of course this shouldn't be the only way we make change, but I think this could make a difference.

Please don't downvote... This is activism. This affects you!

TL;DR Email your congressman when you want to vent about your hard feelings about cannabis legalization.

edit: I realize these go out to their secretaries and interns, but that doesn't mean all is lost. I, personally, resolve to e-mail regularly about the subject, just to get across how much it means to me. I want to generate interest and awareness."

My problem is that I view my self-worth as a comparison of everyone else around me. Basically, **I constantly compare myself to everyone around me and make myself feel like shit**. It's not even about attractiveness (though I do compare my body shape with other people), but intelligence, skills, and experience.

My major is comp sci and I'm struggling to get by. I study really really hard and do understand the material, but when it comes to 50-minute or 15-minute test-taking, I end up getting mediocre grades or failing. And upon learning my classmates scores (one is my boyfriend who is an amazing programmer and the other people are my friends), I compare my bad grades with their As and just fall into a pit of depression and my thought process ultimately leads to ""Why are you so useless?"" ""You should just end it now?"" I work as hard as I can for this class, but I just can't do tests and they decide my grade.

Another thing that I do is compare my experiences to other people. Oh you're an intern at so-and-so? Oh, you made 3 websites already? Wow, you've done more than me. I suck at life, don't I? I am constantly measuring where I am in life by comparing myself to other people, which leads to my fear of being left behind. I also get depressed because of this. I want to do so many things like clubs and a job, but realistically, I can't. I even compare myself to my younger sibling who is a freshman in my school. She's meeting so many more people, being more active, and is more responsible and put together than I am. My parents constantly ask me why I'm not as involved as her, which I answer that I have school to worry about, but they still think I need to be more active, and I feel more like shit.

This semester has gotten very difficult for me to emotionally handle to the point that I'm crying like every week because ""I'm not good enough"". My boyfriend is trying his hardest to help me by going over all of the course material with me to make sure I understand it, but I still end up screwing up while everyone else that he helps gets As. 

What is wrong with me? And how do I fix it?"

2,967 readers, a community for 1 year.

Remember when you were in elementary school and someone would make a fat joke about one of the kids in class? Usually everyone would laugh except, of course, the victim of the mean-spirited remark. Admit it: *you* laughed, too, while the poor kid fought back tears. But don't worry: that doesn't make you a bad person. You were, after all, only a child.

The average redditor likely swears that he or she would never do something like that again. S/He probably believes that he or she would *not only* not join in the laughter but would actually stand up for the victim, scold the laughing classmates, and chastise the bully.

Redditors are like that. Overall we're a classy bunch that stands up for the little guy and celebrates heroes who take down bullies.

Alas, this isn't always the case. Need proof? Head on over to /r/shitredditsays. It's here that you can find a collection of some of the most racist, sexist, homophobic, and simply mean-spirited comments and posts made on reddit. What's more? These aren't comments that have been downvoted to oblivion. Instead, these are comments and posts that *actually received a lot of upvotes!* In other words, this a place that proves redditors can sometimes be as mature as the average YouTuber or XBox Live brat. Only one person may have made the offensive comment, of course, but the fact that it was upvoted so much proves that a lot of redditors cheered the offender on.

But there's [nothing wrong with being offended from time to time](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cycXuYzmzNg). When 99% of reddit-related front page stories are all pats on the collective hivemind's back for being as awesome as we are, perhaps it's even *good* to have the reality check that SRS brings. Namely, that there are just as many bullies and assholes on reddit as there are in the real world. What's more, such bullies and assholes aren't always chastised by the community. Sometimes they're even celebrated.

Recently I sat down to play *Crossfire: The Board Game* with Amrosorma, therealbarackobama, bobappleyard, T2_, teefs, and HPLovecraft to debate SRS. Below is the best transcript I could decipher from the ensuing hours-long yelling-fest.

***

&gt;Explain like I'm 5: what is the purpose of /r/shitredditsays?

&gt;&gt;**Amrosorma**: r/shitredditsays makes fun of all the terrible things that somehow manage to get upvoted on Reddit. From the private messages I’ve gotten from, it’s also a really great community for anyone who gets sick of the racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and all the other lovely things upvoted on Reddit on a disturbingly frequent basis. Imagine a dude’s butt farting for all of eternity

&gt;&gt;**therealbarackobama**: We kept hearing that there was a shadowy cabal of feminist anti-White LGBT supremacists spreading political correctness across Reddit; it actually sounded like a pretty good idea so we went ahead and rolled with it. Towards this end, we take posts out of context, circlejerk about how right we are, coordinate downvote squads, and stifle Rational Debate whenever we can.

&gt;&gt;**bobappleyard**: WE ARE THE FEMBORG. YOU WILL BE EMASCULATED

&gt;&gt;**T2_**: To lead the SRS Schutzstaffel to Gynocratic Glory.

&gt;&gt;**teefs**: One word: Cryptohomofascism. (Heil Gay Hitler (but don’t tell anyone))

&gt;&gt;**HPLovecraft**: You’re not drunk enough for that information. Lemme kino you a bit more, babe

&gt;Was there a particular comment and/or post that was upvoted so much that you felt you had to create /r/shitredditsays in order to vent about it? If so, please provide a link. In any event, please explain why you either created the /r/ or decided to mod for it.

&gt;&gt;**therealbarackobama**: Personally, I was really inspired by the Dominic Strauss-Kahn case. It taught me that a marginalized woman of color who publically confronts a straight white man in a position of political/social/economic power has it pretty fucking made. I invented SRS to get me a piece of that sweet ass money pie. Since then every single person who has crossed me is either paying me child support, in jail after a false rape allegation, shot by an “urban” flash mob, or all three.

&gt;&gt;But for real: like 6 months ago, I was reading a thread and saw a post by a dood called “reddit_sux”, who had one of the more cogent critiques of Reddit culture I had seen. I was intrigued, went through his history, and found his “guess the Redditor” posts on SRS where he would take quotes from Stormfront and Reddit. You had to guess which was which (this was really fuckin hard). Sadly, reddit_sux went and found a better community about 9 months ago, leaving the subreddit in disrepair. Over the summer, when I was killing time at my internship, I just started submitting the best MRA shit I found to SRS. Around the same time, other users like dbzer0 were doing the same and this all slowly brought the subreddit back from the grave.

&gt;&gt;I remember one day I submitted a post that talked about how feminism’s primary goal was to maximize the number of alpha male penises they could get or some crazy bullshit like that, and we started riffing on it; someone posted “PRIME DIRECTIVE: ACQUIRE ALPHA MALE PENISES” and I really wanted to make it the SRS title so I submitted a redditrequest. I had apparently pissed off at least one dude enough for them to stalk my post history and cross-post my redditrequest to /r/mensrights. Once other users from SRS found out about the drama in the redditrequest thread, the resulting shitstorm gave us some pretty good traffic. There really wasn’t one particular post so much it was this massive trend towards posting pseudo-objectivist privilege-affirming nerd meal and then calling anyone who disagreed irrational or politically correct that got me involved with SRS. 

&gt;&gt;**bobappleyard**: SRS was created by reddit_sux, who is no longer on the site. I can't speculate as to why they chose to do so. I was drawn to the subreddit because in a particularly depressing conversation I saw them kicking ass and taking names. As one is wont to do, I perused their posting history, and discovered SRS.

&gt;&gt;After reddit_sux left the subreddit went into a kind of limbo. It was eventually revived, I think by dbzero. Then people started joining in serious numbers. therealbarackobama petitioned the admins to grant him moderator status, by which time the subreddit had already developed notoriety, particularly amongst the denizens of /r/MensRights.

&gt;&gt;Barry made me a mod so that I could do some CSS things. I've only really added some silly emoticons though.

&gt;&gt;**Amrosorma**: There is no venting on r/shitredditsays. It is all fuel for the gynocratic lizard overlord fire; these will be the tracts we read as we wage intergalactic war on the patriarchy and shatter the yoke of oppression on all non-straight/white/male humans through the thermal energy of straight white man foreskins burned in mass effigy.

&gt;&gt;**-T2_**: I really just like to mock people. And play with user flair. Flair is fun.

&gt;&gt;**HPLovecraft**: I literally was just tapped to become mod because I destroyed r/jailbait with my kegels alone. You’re welcome.

&gt;&gt;But seriously, I joined r/ShitRedditSays because of the shitposters that inhabited r/worstof.

&gt;When I browse your /r/ I often find myself enraged and/or disappointed by the fact that so many offensive and stupid comments/posts can receive so many upvotes. However, I resist the temptation to downvote those things, per your /r/'s rules. I ask you: why shouldn't your /r/ be a ""downvote brigade""? What's the benefit to the Reddit community of highlighting the trolls and assholes without punishing them for their ill-chosen words?

&gt;&gt;**bobappleyard**: As we are part of a deep cover feminist lizard-bodied individual conspiracy, we need to not affect the precious internet points or the rest of Reddit will find out about our evil plans. It’s all about furthering the transdimensional gynocracy, one step at a time.

&gt;&gt;**therealbarackobama**: First off, if SRS consistently downvoted the posts it links to, it would sweep the bigotry and hate that a lot of people have to actually deal with under the rug, which is totally counterproductive to the general groove of SRS. If everything we link to gets -50 votes or whatever, it makes the fact that Reddit is pretty overtly hostile to anyone who is not a white straight male 1%er seem like less of a problem than it actually is.

&gt;&gt;More importantly, I really am not comfortable declaring Reddit to be the locus of social justice activism and progressive liberalism that a lot of our critics seem to think it is. If we really want to tell ourselves that mashing the down arrow on posts that openly declare their bigotry is going to Solve The Problems then honestly, we're deluding ourselves. I do activism in real life so maybe I have a different perspective, but if my goal was to make Reddit a better place, messing with peoples’ internet points would not be the centerpiece of my strategy, so a lot of the yelling about us being a shadowy cabal playing master of puppets with Reddit for some femi-lizard conspiracy falls flat (even though it’s actually true!)

&gt;&gt;My opinion has always been that I really do not give a shit what people's karma is and if people losing points because of /srs is a side effect of what we're doing, I really do not have much trepidation with regards to that. And really, if the first reaction someone has to being called out as a bigot is not ""hm what could i have said that could have hurt someone else?"" but ""my internet points ;_;"" then maybe fuck everything.

&gt;&gt;** T2_**: Quite simply, the reason why we do not downvote brigade is because we seek to preserve the shit that has been said. Immortalize it, so to speak. To hold people accountable for the shit they've said. Downvoting a comment doesn't really accomplish much, especially not if a comment has ~100+ upvotes. Another reason why we don't downvote brigade is because that de-legitimizes us in the minds of other redditors and reinforces a mob mentality.

&gt;&gt;**Amrosorma**: Barry and T2_ covered the whole bit about downvote brigades so I’d like to talk about the benefit of r/SRS to the Reddit community. It’s a place where anyone who is sick of how minority issues and discourse is generally treated on Reddit (with little understanding, less social literacy, and even less empathy) can come and find like-minded and similarly literate users. There’s a whole vibe of catharsis from people who would otherwise have no options in finding minority discourse on Reddit or other sites. I’d say it’s a safe space, but trolls and shit posters tend to get downvoted pretty hard. And yet, I somehow manage to sleep at night.  

&gt;&gt;**HPLovecraft**: It’s like a zoo. A zoo of poo. You don’t touch the poo.

&gt;In an ideal world, where do you see your /r/ a year from now? How do you envision the future of /r/shitredditsays?

&gt;&gt;**therealbarackobama**: A HORSE 

&gt;&gt;**bobappleyard**: SRS has to be the number one subreddit in a year’s time or it will objectively be a failure.

&gt;&gt;**T2_**: We need to be in the center of the greatest shitstorm Reddit has ever seen. It will last a thousand years and will bury the servers beneath the shitsands of pooptime.

&gt;&gt;**Amrosorma**: In the upcoming year, r/shitredditsays will become a shrine to the archangel of gynocratic lizard flame as She rends the straight white man’s Earth with her flaming sword and turns it into a planetary charnel house. Afterwards, there will be teacakes, straight white man foreskin soup, and a moderate amount of revelry.

&gt;&gt;**therealbarackobama**: NO BUT SERIOUSLY I WANT IT TO BE A HORSE SO I CAN RIDE IT TO AND FROM PLACES.

&gt;My mom knows my Reddit username and will probably read this writeup. In deference to her sensibilities, could you please change your /r/'s name to ""bad-things-redditors-sometimes-say""?

&gt;&gt;**bobappleyard**: Everybody says there is this RACE problem. Everybody says this RACE problem will be solved when the third world pours into EVERY White country and ONLY into White countries.

&gt;&gt;The Netherlands and Belgium are more crowded than Japan or Taiwan, but nobody says Japan or Taiwan will solve this RACE problem by bringing in millions of third worlders and quote assimilating unquote with them.

&gt;&gt;Everybody says the final solution to this RACE problem is for EVERY White country and ONLY white countries to ""assimilate,"" i.e., intermarry, with all those non-Whites.

&gt;&gt;What if I said there was this RACE problem and this RACE problem would be solved only if hundreds of millions of non-blacks were brought into EVERY black country and ONLY into black countries?

&gt;&gt;How long would it take anyone to realize I'm not talking about a RACE problem. I am talking about the final solution to the BLACK problem?

&gt;&gt;And how long would it take any sane black man to notice this and what kind of psycho black man wouldn't object to this?

&gt;&gt;But if I tell that obvious truth about the ongoing program of genocide against my race, the White race, Liberals and respectable conservatives agree that I am a naziwhowantstokillsixmillionjews.

&gt;&gt;They say they are anti-racist. What they are is anti-White.

&gt;&gt;Anti-racist is a code word for anti-White.

&gt;&gt;**T2_**: I giggled a bit when I first read this comment, but then I realized that our name could possibly be off-putting to certain readers. Though this is true, I think that the use of shit is fairly justifiable. By using such a strong term, it has more impact than just saying ""Bad things"". It's us pointing out that what the user said is truly shit, that it is completely inappropriate and we are going to call them out on it. Whether it be racism, sexism, classism, homophobia, transphobia or any other form of discrimination, what is being said is shit. I don't believe there's a better way to describe it. Our apologies to jmk4422's mom.

&gt;&gt;**therealbarackobama**: this is funny, normally when i’m apologizing to a redditor’s mom, its for leaving a fake number, because i have had sex with then given a fake identity to every redditor ever’s mom, but that said i’m really sorry that our name is a cuss i didnt pick it :\

&gt;&gt;i feel like “sometimes say” is sort of inaccurate tho, the problem isn’t that the posts we link to are anomalies that are somehow out of the reddit mainstream, it’s that these attitudes are endemic to reddit(ors). the fact that we mostly link to upvoted stuff shows that these beliefs are pretty popular, and typically, the people who call these posts out are downvoted into silence. at srs, they aren’t, and that’s nice.

&gt;&gt;**Amrosorma**: It is counterproductive, even lethal to waste another five decades on meaningless dialogue while we are continuously losing our demographical advantage. We have never and will never be allowed to ever exercise any influence. The cultural Marxist/multiculturalist elites nationally and in Brussels have for the last five decades created a resilient system whose objective is to ridicule, persecute, harass and silence us. They will continue to systematically marginalize us until the day when we are no longer a threat to them.

&gt;&gt;**HPLovecraft**: Your mom actually browses reddit? I hope you disabled all of the large subreddits from her front page, the poor thing.

&gt;Finally, what is your absolute favorite post that has been made to your /r/ so far, and why? ((Please provide a link)).

&gt;&gt;**bobappleyard**: http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/jn40u/this_ones_a_goldmine/ Because it really is.

&gt;&gt;**Amrosorma**: The entire series of “Reddit or Stormfront?” comparisons by reddit_sux; that’s what got most of us here in the first place: http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/search?q=author%3Areddit_sux&amp;sort=top&amp;restrict_sr=on - 

&gt;&gt;I also love that I_HAVE_CATS posts pictures of their cats in (nearly) every comment they make on r/SRS; they are My Favorite Poster.

&gt;&gt;**therealbarackobama**: There’s too many to name. fxexular’s megaposts never disappoint; that dude is like a bloodhound for awful opinions. The fallout from the whole Anderson Cooper vs. /r/jailbait incident was pretty great too. Really anything that demonstrates how inappropriately important reddit is to redditors, or how far people will go to justify their privilege are winners in my book.

&gt;&gt;**HPLovecraft**: Definitely this one: http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/jlqnk/white_people_why_do_you_name_your_kids_ridiculous/ Literally a day before this was posted, there was a “Black People: why do you name your kid ridiculous names?” thread on the front page. Somehow the white folks think that naming your child “Sterling Archer” is awesome and not at all ridiculous. Also it’s where my flair comes from.

Thanks to the SRS mods for taking the time to answer these questions and for maintaining the disturbingly awesome that is /r/shitredditsays! Courage."

When will companies stop adding ""Jr."", ""Intern"" or ""Entry-Level"" as an excuse to underpay people? $10-12/hr for someone who knows PHP and has a Bachelors in CS.. I wish them luck.

Don't they realize that 99% of people who can code per their requirements have freelanced before, and have recognized its potential?

I am currently in my first year of college, and I plan on transferring to Georgia Tech ASAP (best technical school in the south I believe).  I want to obtain my Bachelor's and eventually Master's degrees in Computer Science.  I have a solid foundation in math already for this major.  I am working on learning and being as efficient as possible with C++/Python/Java.  What I want is to work for Google and I want to start with with my foot in the door by obtaining an internship if possible toward the later years of my college education.  What should I do to increase my chances to land an internship?"
lb6lh,1,2011-10-13,Started dating a friend straight out of a 3+year relationship. Having second thoughts about it 3 mo. later.,throwmyheartaway,relationshipadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/lb6lh/started_dating_a_friend_straight_out_of_a_3year/,"Over the summer, my boyfriend of 3+ years broke up with me less than two months after we signed a lease and moved into a new apartment together. I was absolutely devasted to say the least. I was just starting a new internship literally the day he brought up the whole ""we need a break"" conversation, which two days later turned into an official end to our relationship. Things were good when we moved in, or so I thought. Then, suddenly, he had a quarter life crisis and started to question literally everything in his life... his job, overall purpose in life, me, etc. So, it was a confusing breakup for me because I did nothing wrong and could not have foreseen his actions and change in mindset. 

After this ordeal, I stayed with my two good friends in another part of the city I live in while I figured out what was going to happen with the lease (yeah, I was the one who got the shaft and lived out of a bag for a month...) One of them is my best friend, the other a good guy friend of mine who I began to hook up with about a week after the breakup. For the first week, I was a total wreck. Then, I started partying and became really close with guy friend I was staying with, lets call him Rob. We started having sex regularly, and I thought of it as purely a FWB situation. That is, until we went on a couple of trips with other friends and I started to develop romantic feelings for him. Turns out he had a crush on me for over a year. I was kind of weirded out at first about the fact that I was starting a new relationship right out of a very long one, but after talking about it with my best friend I came to the realization that I shouldn't deprive myself of happiness if that's what I was feeling at the time. So I decided to go with it and now we are official (as of a month and a half ago, I believe...)

So now I'm having second thoughts because suddenly all of these confusing feelings are flooding my mind all at once. I'm 22, in my last year of college, and I'm realizing that I don't know myself as well as I should by now. I'm learning this the more I get to know Rob more. I've found that he constantly dominates conversations (both among the two of us and social settings), and when I interject in the middle of a rant, he will get frustrated and say he lost his train of thought. It's hard to communicate with him, and as I try to get to know him better I am unsure if our personalities are compatible.

On the flip, we have many similar interests and tastes in movies, comedy, etc. I like that a lot about us together. However, I don't know if he ""gets me"" on a deeper level.. I can't tell if he's interested in that. And how can he get me if right now I don't totally understand my own self?

Anyway, I know this is semi-ranty but I needed to get it off my chest because I am trying to read all this literature on semiotics for a test next week. I literally can't comprehend anything because it's on my mind.

Also-- I ended up moving into the same neighborhood as my friends, and we are now 4 blocks away from each other. We spend a lot of time together and usually sleep in the same bed.  

I don't know how to approach talking to him about this because I don't know if I want to break up with him or not... and I don't want to hurt him, because I really do like him a lot. Has anyone been in a situation like this? Any words of advice on how to approach it would be helpful. Thanks for reading, I know it was a long shpeel."

lb26l,127,2011-10-13,Computers LY5,kriel,explainlikeimfive,https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/lb26l/computers_ly5/,"As an IT Tech, I've gathered a rather large set of analogies to explain to my users what all the pieces of a computer are and what they do. Now I'm going to write them down in one place. (And yes, sometimes I have to treat the users like they're 5.)

~~___________________________________~~

**CPU:** Imagine there's a guy working in his office. He is very obedient, and does everything that's asked of him, exactly as it was asked. This is the CPU. He does all of the thinking and moves everything around in his office to make things work. How fast he goes about his job is how 'fast' the cpu is. This is generally measured in GHz, and usually goes from 1.0-4.0.

**RAM:** His desk can be bigger or smaller, so he has more room to work. This is the RAM. A bigger desk allows him to work on more things at once. Anything that's on his desk is in easy arm's reach, so it's fairly fast to grab things out of RAM, however if he's got too much on his desk he'll start slowing down. A clean desk helps him work properly. Every program that runs takes up so much RAM, has SOMETHING that needs to be out on the desk. RAM is measured in GB, and is usually goes from 1GB to 8GB or so.

**HDDs:** Behind him is a filing room, like a huge walk-in closet full from floor to ceiling with filing cabinets. This is the Hard Drive, aka HDD. Anything he puts in there STAYS in there, even if the computer is rebooted. A lot of things need to go in there. Anytime he goes online, he has to print things off of the computer and file them away in a 'temporary' cache, so he can give them to you later. (Later, being 50ms later, but time goes by REAAAALLY fast for him.) If his filing room starts getting too full, it can take him longer and longer to get stuff in or out, which slows everything down. When you tell him to 'defragment', what you're doing is telling him to spend time reorganizing everything in here so that he can find it faster. HDD's are generally measured in GB or TB (1 T = 1,000 G) and usually go from 200GB - 2+TB.

**Removable Storage: **CD's, DVD's, and USB Drives are like trucks backing up to a garage door, but they hold the same kinds of things as the filing room. He can move stuff back and forth (however CDs + DVDs are generally read-only, meaning he can get stuff out but not put it back in, unless he has a special garage door called a 'burner')

**Network: **The phone on his desk is the 'network', whether it's wireless or wired. (inb4 recursion.) This is how he talks to other guys in other offices, to do cool things like ask them to send him a picture of a kitten. How fast he can talk is how fast the internet is. Sometimes the line is really scratchy (crappy wifi signal), and sometimes he picks it up and there's no dial tone. (no wifi / not plugged in / internet is out)

He can work a lot faster than he can talk, so a lot of times your internet speed ends up being the bottleneck, unless he has a LOT of stuff on his desk that all wants his attention.

**Multi-core: **Another thing that might come up is multi-core processors. This is when you put TWO guys in the office (or more). They can both be working on different things, but they have to work together, since they still only get one table, one filing room, etc.

**Reboot: **Now, when the desk gets too cluttered or they accidentally spill their coffee all over what they're working on, sometimes they need to reboot. When this happens, the guys go home, relax for awhile, and then come back. When they come back, their office is completely empty. (I suspect it was the cleaning ladies. or the gremlins.) However, the filing room and any trucks that might be backed in are still EXACTLY the way they left them. They spend awhile setting everything up according to the instructions that are in a special place in the filing room before they start listening to the phone. This is called 'booting up'.

This is why rebooting your computer can fix so much. If a program goes rogue (or stupid) and starts thrashing around on the desk, or screaming LOOKIT ME LOOKIT ME over and over again, you can reboot the computer and it gets set up just like new, and hopefully more well-behaved. That said, if it's a problem with something in the filing room (because that also holds all the instructions for how to set up the office), it'll stick around even after a reboot.

This is also why everything wants you to reboot it after it installs or updates. They put new instructions in the filing room, but the office is still set up the 'old' way. So it wants the office to be re-set-up from scratch to make sure it's all in the right place. Sometimes you can get away without doing it, but why not just spend the thirty seconds to make sure?

**Antivirus: **Sometimes there's a special program sitting on the desk called an Antivirus. This little thing has explicit instructions on it that say 'Anything you guys touch needs to go through me to make sure it's safe. Especially anything you hear over the phone. I don't trust those guys.' Now, this can take quite a bit of extra time out of their day, but it's important, because viruses and such are getting nastier and nastier. (And antiviruses are getting bigger and bigger because they have to scrutinize EVERYthing.) Sometimes they let nasty buggers through, but that's because the nasties are getting better and better at looking innocent. (I'm sure NONE of you five year olds know a thing about that.)


~~___________________________________~~

**Video Cards:** The CPU has to make reports (show stuff on screen) to the boss (the user). He has an underling (the video chip) in charge of making these reports. Most computers come with an integrated video chip, soldered onto the motherboard. This guy is like an intern. He shares a desk (RAM) with the CPU, and knows how to make PowerPoints, pictures, and maybe a simple video. The CPU gives him instructions on what to show the boss, and the video chip does his best to do so. However, he's just an intern, and his abilities are limited.

Eventually, the intern leaves and the boss hires a video card. It [looks like this](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814125401) and usually costs between $60 and $600. This guy is really good at his job. He has his own desk (VRAM), and is very specialized at his job. He's even faster than the CPU at some things! now the reports can have all sorts of flashy videos and 3D effects. (HD video, 3D graphics for video games). The downside is that he takes a really high salary (lots of power) and he works so fast he gets sweaty and needs more A/C (better cooling).

~~___________________________________~~

**Boot Up:** Every morning when the worker (CPU) gets ready for work, he has a to-do list (boot list) before he can start work. He puts on clothes, grabs a cup of coffee, gets in his car, turns on the coffee machine at work, unlocks the filing room, takes out the things he needs to work; pencils, paper, stapler, eraser. All of this takes time from when he wakes up to when he actually starts working.

In order to get him to work faster he can skip getting coffee and not take out his stapler or eraser until he needs them later in the day. The reason to not take them out when he gets to work is he won't have to staple anything or erase anything when he first sits at his desk because he hasn't started work yet. It will still take time later for him to take out his stapler when he needs it, but he can get to work faster if he saves this step for later.

(thanks to [locopyro13](http://www.reddit.com/user/locopyro13))

Also, something else to remember. Sometimes you need to install, say, a lamination machine. This takes up a huge chunk of your desk and you have to plug it in every morning and it gets to be a huge pain. Especially since you only laminate stuff once every few weeks.

The reason the lamination machine is on the to-do list is because the people who make the lamination machine want it to be set up on your desk, so that it can occasionally see if it can shout about a new product or something. (I'm looking at you, Adobe Updater.) So when you unpack the brand-new machine, it asks to be put on the morning to-do list. However, this wastes time, resources, and all sorts of other things.

So what you can do is you can go into the to-do list and take out 'set up lamination machine.' It won't be sitting on your desk all the time, but if you need it, you can still get it.

(Rinse and repeat for most updaters, 'quick launchers' and other such annoying startup programs)

lb1zl,2,2011-10-13,Help! GF of 2 1/2 years left me,plasmidvector,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/lb1zl/help_gf_of_2_12_years_left_me/,"My (ex)-girlfriend and I have been dating 2 ½ years, we’re both 23. We met sophomore year in college, but didn’t begin dating until my junior year. For the first year and a half after we met, I asked her out a few times, of which she said yes but we never ended up going out. We hung out and studied together, etc. 

After around 6 months of me not talking to her much, she called me up and we started hanging out again and that’s when we started dating. We dated from the middle of Spring ’08 and then she went on a summer internship to another country in May. We kept in close contact but as the summer went on, I heard less and less from her (we were still dating and wanted to make it work) and her terms of endearment began to fade. 

When she got back to the States she broke up with me the next day, over the phone, saying that she didn’t know what she wanted. I was devastated. Fast forward two weeks and we are both back at college starting senior year (her junior year) – I asked her if we could talk and hang out as friends, and we did. After a few times of hanging out, she invited me to stay the night, and we began dating again. 

Everything since that time has been wonderful, we almost never fought over anything, stayed with eachother every night, had classes together, etc. The following school year (her senior year – 2010-2011), I stayed to take more classes and we ended up moving in together. This was the best year of my life – we spent a lot of time together, obviously, but also hung out with our own friends and met up at the end of the night on weekends. Our relationship was perfect, and she had brought up the possibility of marriage one day. She would show me pictures of rings she liked, and wedding dresses she preferred, although we had both agreed we wouldn’t get married until we had the finances in order (we both planned on attending professional school). That year, she was accepted to a professional program in another part of the state, and I was accepted into a graduate program around 50 miles away. 

During this past summer (the summer before she moved to school), we lived together still and vowed to make it work through school, even though it was going to be hard. She ended up moving to school in August and I started school where I am now. She met new friends and was having a decent time, though school was definitely taxing. We took turns every other week going to see eachother for a day or two on the weekends (it has been 6 weeks since we started school), and everything seemed fine. However, last week she had an extremely grueling week filled with exams and got very little sleep. 

Over the week, her terms of endearment began to fade again, I heard less and less from her until it seemed like the only way I would talk to her is if I initiated the conversation. Usually we spoke on the phone or skyped every night before bed, and texted eachother first thing in the morning when we woke up – but she began to do neither last week. On Friday (10/7), she was supposed to come see me, but when I talked to her on the phone, said that she has felt like “things have been weird between us lately” and was dismissive in our conversation. When I asked her how long she thought it was weird, she replied “the past week”. I asked her if she was still coming to see me and she said yes, until she ended up hurting herself playing in a rec sports game later that night. 

I asked her if I could come see her instead, and she apprehensively said yes, and I drove the hour up at 10 at night to stay with her. She went to bed within an hour, and we cuddled like everything was normal. The next morning (Saturday), I asked her if she thought we were going to make it through this (like we had promised eachother in summer), and she said she hoped so but wasn’t sure. She was having a difficult time adjusting to the workload of school and not seeing me – she felt like she was being pulled from all directions. We hung out for a few more hours before I went back to my hometown that night for a local festival with friends.

 She also planned to come to the city near-by with her friends (though not close enough to see eachother) and go out. That night, while we were both at separate bars, she was texting me with terms of endearment, just like things used to be, on her own will. The following day (Sunday), we both met up in the city I am in school in and had dinner and went shopping for a few hours. She apologized for being “blah” lately, and I told her it was ok, and that I was always here for her and that we could make it through this. 

Monday was similar, lots of texting eachother when we had time, and everything was fine. Tuesday was the same way, and I asked her to call me before I went to bed Tuesday night. When we began the conversation, she seemed distant again. I asked her what was wrong and she said the same thing, “things have been weird between us for the past week” – when I asked her what was weird, how could I fix it, she couldn’t give me an answer to either. She said she didn’t know what she wanted and was being pulled in all different directions. She ended the conversation by saying, “I don’t know what else to say”, and I said “ok, I guess I’ll talk to you later”, she said bye, and that was it. We haven’t talked since Tuesday night (it’s Thursday), and I doubt we will talk unless I initiate a conversation, which I don’t want to do. I’m horribly torn up inside – after we got back together the first time, she said she realized how much of a mistake it was and that she would never break it off again. 

I mean, this was the girl I wanted to marry and spend the rest of my life with. I’m in the midst of applying to professional programs and have the opportunity to be at her campus where she is in school in less than a year. I know the distance stinks, and the school work is terribly difficult for her, but we had a lot of opportunities to see eachother coming up (fall break, thanksgiving in 5 weeks, xmas break 2 weeks after that for a month), but I don’t know what to do now. I want to give her space for atleast a week and text her to let her know I’m thinking of her, but I don’t want to pressure her at all. Who breaks up with their 2 ½ year boyfriend over “feeling weird” for a week, though? This is by far the hardest thing I’ve ever done and I don’t really know where to go from here.  I still want to fight for this girl, but how should I even try to do that?

She is a 2 year old border collie, a sweetheart to say the least. She listens to me as if I've trained her from a puppy. She is happy as could be with me. She is a bit timid, living most of her life on a farm and having an abusive owner as a puppy...so she needs ton of socialization still. She is a great dog and will never be a problem.

However, I am in school currently,  though I intern half of the year, so generally I have the money for her, though if brutal emergency care snuck up on me, it could be tough. (I've started saving for this already, though I am contemplating pet insurance...anyone have good experience with this?) I will also be relocating often, and I want to make sure she is capable of it. I've got 6 months to be with her now before I need to move though, so I am planning on shaking her timid nature in that time.  

Anyone have any opinions for me before I pull the trigger?"

lalv5,2,2011-10-13,A few questions for r/keto before I dived into the lifestyle...,kakkumei,keto,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/lalv5/a_few_questions_for_rketo_before_i_dived_into_the/,"Hey guys, first of, I'm a 25 years old female, 157cm and currently weighing around 65kg. A little background of myself:

I used to weigh around 49-50kg when I was 13-15, but that's due to not eating ( I used to only eat lunch) and excess walking. But I gained extra 5kg when I was 16-17 even though at that time I'm actively playing sport (basketball practice daily). After I left school and entered college, my body ballooned up to 57kg-63kg. Usually when I reached 63kg, it's pretty easy for me to lose the extra kilos to get back to 57kg in a months time.

But here's where my trouble start. I started my internship last year, and my weight was around 57kg. And somehow in a few months time, I gained 12 kg without realizing it to a whooping 69kg. After trying to lose the weight (portion cutting, and jogging) I only managed to get it down to 65kg (my current weight).

My question is, can I still do keto even with my fluctuating weight? And I'm starting the C25k program this week, will keto interfere with the exercise?

Thanks for your help.

lcnjd,3,2011-10-14,Premed Committee - Is it me or him?,premedmeddy,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/lcnjd/premed_committee_is_it_me_or_him/,"This is kind of(very) long/ranty but it's been bothering me a lot lately.

Just for background, I'm a Junior 3.6 gpa(top 5% of class though), science major.

Extracurriculars: 
*  Children's Tutoring Program 1 semester 
*  Children's Tutoring Program 1 semester (slightly different, more responsibility) 
*  Peer Tutor 2 years 
*  3 years taekwondo (quit this year due to cost) 
*  Research with an upcoming publication 
*  Professional Organization *Amnesty International Member 
*  Volunteered at VA for 1 summer, a few hours here and there afterwards (time conflict) 
*  Current Red Cross Volunteer 
*  Colleges Against Cancer Member

Worked a bit here and there(test proctoring &amp; retail). 

This year I plan on shadowing and I'm in the process of applying for a health related internship.

My premed committee has 4 advisors, and I've known 3 of them pretty much my entire college career. The first 3 advisors have given me advice as to what classes I should take and about my EC choices. I know I'm not the most amazing candidate, but I don't think I'm doing horribly (I might be the only qualifying candidate in my year - our committee has to accept us).

Anyways, this year I had my first meeting with the 4th advisor, and he came off as a total d-bag. 

I've taken maybe ~20 credits of liberal arts electives in the 3 years I've been here(got A's except for 1 A-), which I figured was average. I need 1 more liberal arts class to satisfy my requirements. #4 wants me to drop my research or directed electives in order to take more liberal arts classes, because apparently no one will give my application a second glance. I told him that my senior year was very open for electives, but that didn't satisfy him.

He pretty much told me my ECs are worthless.

He asked what my practice MCAT scores were (~10 in each section, have not really studied), and told me that I'm probably not going to do well on the MCAT at all. He also told me that I probably won't be able to do well on the writing section, even though he has yet to read anything I've written - ever.

Then he asked me about current events so I talked to him about some union issues going on in our city, OWS, and Ai WeiWei. He was not satisfied, told me I was reading the wrong newspapers, and that I shouldn't believe everything I read (I don't think I gave off that impression....).

He questioned me about NASA, so I talked about the program ending and possible implications to America's future. Apparently I missed the point (he said to talk freely), which was that the industry is going to be privatized(which I knew, but he didn't give the conversation any direction).

More went on in the meeting (almost 2 hrs), some of which involved me crying after he asked me about some sensitive issues in my personal life.

This just bothers me a lot, because this man is going to edit my personal statement, and I don't feel comfortable writing about anything personal to give to him. He is EXTREMELY well liked by students and faculty, which made me even more shocked at the way he spoke to me. At the end of the meeting he told me that I shouldn't have expected him to ""tell you you're great."" 

I never expected him to tell me I was great, and I never expected the meeting to be an interview type situation(I thought we were going to talk about personal statements, because that's what he does for the committee). I'm a fairly quiet person, I'm not pushy, and I'm very polite. I have no idea what to do in the future, because this man dislikes me so much.

Any advice/insight?"

lbx5l,20,2011-10-14,Is it common for pregnancy and childbirth to completely alter a woman's behavior? My wife is  becoming increasingly violent and psychologically abusive.,[deleted],MensRights,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/lbx5l/is_it_common_for_pregnancy_and_childbirth_to/,"My wife has been getting increasingly psychologically abusive since our daughter was born. I openly admit that I argue with her, especially when I feel that I am in the right, but violence and extremely abusive language should never be ok. When I say abusive language, I don't mean swearing, I mean saying things to tear me down, attack my contributions to the family, belittling my career or sneering about how she doesn't care about our sex life.    
  
In the past few weeks it has gotten really bad. She is especially aggressive if I challenge her in any way. ""You're already going to do what I say, so just do it and don't complain."" I have been standing up for myself more and more, because I do *not* want to sit idly by and let this become the status quo. It seems like the more I stand up to her the more she escalates.    
  
For the past few days she increasingly wants me to wake up and deal with the baby, who has been a bit fussy since she's learned to roll over and wakes herself up when she rolls at night. No problem, but I don't usually hear her cry so my wife has to wake me up. I'm a deep sleeper, but I would wake with a word or a gentle shake, instead she's decided that I ""won't wake up"" unless she hits me.  
  
Last night she kicked me awake. Tonight she did it again. I immediately got up and dealt with the baby, but when I laid down I said, ""don't fucking hit me, you have been warned."" She immediately swung at me and punched me in the fucking temple, and when I say immediately I mean she connected before I finished the word ""warned."" I did something I've never done in my life, I swung back. I punched her as hard as I could, square in the ass.  
  
This initiated fifteen minutes of indignant hysterics. I kept repeating, ""it's not ok to hit me. Don't hit me. Find another way to wake me up."" She insisted that I go sleep on the couch. I refused. She pulled all the blankets, pillows and bedsheets from the bed. I still refused to leave. Finally, she dumped a cup of water on my head, stormed out, jumped in the car and left. It's 2:56 a.m.  

There are two things I feel are relevant. First, my wife was pretty severely abused as a kid. Second, she has often said that she feared this abuse would make her lose control and become abusive herself. Her father left her mother and six kids, and while I don't personally like her dad that much he doesn't seem like the type to walk out on his family. 
  
Perhaps it's for the best that she slammed the door before I finished the sentence, but as she left tonight I started to say, ""I think we solved a mystery tonight [slam] what could possibly make a loving father leave his wife and six kids."" Her mother is known for embroidering the truth, and her mother's official explanation is that her father was doing drugs and she kicked him out. This has never seemed a satisfactory explanation to me since her mother also had a history of drug and alcohol abuse.    
  
So is there some kind of biological basis for what's happening to her? Did her mother, for lack of a better description, lose her fucking mind after she had kids and drive her husband out of the house doing crazy shit like this? She was a very sweet, gentle and kind person when I met her. We've been together for almost seven years now, I never expected the honeymoon to last forever, but this seems to me to be a dramatic personality shift.  
   
I feel it necessary, in my own defense, to point out that I am gainfully employed, in a career I graduated from college to do. I did graduate a couple years after her. When we met I was working full time and taking night classes. We moved in together and I was the primary bread winner while she finished school. When she graduated and got her career started I went back to school full time, and finished a four year program in 2 1/2 years. During that time I worked, my average was over eighty hours of work and class per week not including study time. Of course, my pay was awful and she to this day resents ""having to support me."" Lately she has taken to talking about all the things she could have done with ""her"" money if she hadn't had me to support. I completed an internship during my senior year and landed a full time career position within a month of graduation, in the middle of the worst recession since the great depression.  
  
I do the majority of the housework, I do home improvements, I take care of our four dogs, I do all the yard work, I do all the cooking, I give my daughter her baths and read to her every night. I see my daughter approximately 1 1/2 hours a day because I often spend 2-3 hours riding the bus to and from work to save us money (at my wife's request). I don't drink, I rarely smoke pot, I don't cheat. Basically, I think the worst thing about me is how much time I spend on Reddit which is usually a couple hours after she goes to bed and in between chores on the weekend. I've been staying up late on Reddit lately and often falling asleep on the couch instead of in our bed, but I honestly feel like this is a reaction to her pushing me away and not the other way around. The past few nights I made a point of going to bed with her and tonight's episode was the result.  
  
Since my daughter was born my wife has done the majority of the care for her, especially night time feedings. In the first few months we established this routine, primarily because she would be up and out of bed to get the crying baby before I was even awake. 
  
In other words, I am not some kind of unemployed, uninvolved, lazy douchebag. I don't feel that I deserve to be treated this way, or that I have done anything to earn her spite.
  
**TL;DR:** My wife's personality has dramatically changed since the birth of our daughter, eight months ago. She has become verbally, psychologically and physically abusive. I'm hard working, a dedicated father, do most of the domestic chores and have been very patient with her up until now. In the past few weeks I've been standing up for  myself and she is escalating her violent behavior."

About me:
-20 years old
-Married (wife is living at home, going to college while I'm interning)
-(Obviously) Taking an unpaid internship on Capitol Hill
-Very driven, intelligent, outgoing, down-to-Earth. Liberal atheist but very well-rounded and open-minded.
-Definitely willing to be interviewed, background checked, let you meet my wife, etc. Hell, I'd even invite you up to my place back home.
-Internship ends around Dec 12-22ish

My situation:
I'm currently living in Stafford, VA. I commute using the VRE everyday at a cost of about $270/month. I moved in with a childhood friend and his wife. They got married out of nowhere and the plan, since before they had got married, was I'd be living with him for around $300 (all I could afford/he said he would ask) from September until the end of my internship. Things are now strange as he and his wife are demanding more money and now on a monthly basis. Yes, I had a good deal but now I'm looking at unplanned total travel/housing expenses of $600/month plus food and all of my bills in our apartment at home. My wife and I had saved up just enough money to afford all of this during the summer but now I'm not working because of the internship and she is working part-time plus going to school full-time. Family is of no help on either side (not the best relationship with my parents and have been on my own since I was 18).  I really just need one room with access to a bathroom and Internet/electric for as little as humanly possible. I don't have much I could give, but I would do nearly anything asked of me in terms of errands/housework. I can cook and am very respectful. I'm very well-mannered. I would infinitely owe you one and would be more than glad to have you as a friend/repay you with a generous gift of some sort whenever I get home and back to work.

tl;dr: I'm super poor due to an unpaid internship and unforeseen problems with my current living situation. Looking for a very kind DC redditor to help me have a cheap place to rest my head from sometime in late October until mid-December. I'd be forever grateful.

Very hopeful; thanks for reading."
lbnfi,2,2011-10-13,Need advice concerning aloof behavior,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/lbnfi/need_advice_concerning_aloof_behavior/,"Currently, I have been dating someone for 3 months and I have been questioning my relationship with her.

Whenever I do see her during the week, she is almost always quiet and moody. In addition, I wonder why she often displays frigid body language around me. She often says that she is terrible at giving warm and fuzzy signals, but I feel skeptical about this. Though I have met her friends, I have had some difficulties getting her to meet my friends. The past two times I have tried to introduce them to her, she has resisted going. She keeps insisting that she is somehow interfering with my time with my friends, even though I have made it clear that they would like to meet her and that she is not bothering anybody.

The only time she is ever really affectionate verbally or physically is during and after sex. There are no problems with sex at all and we are both equally satisfied. My only concern is that I don’t want sex to be the only time that we are intimate, even if sexuality has a huge impact on my level of happiness

She does like to give gifts and has given me a few books. This weekend she surprised me with a cake when I was told to expect an e-mail for a second interview with my internship prospect. Often we split the costs of things on our dates and we both take equal parts in planning our dates out. We also keep in contact on a daily basis (mostly text messages with a few phone calls a week that I usually initiate.

She told me this was the first time that she was in a ""normal"" relationship where she was not treated terribly and that I was the first nice, caring boyfriend she's had. Generally, I appreciate hearing these things, but hearing the word “nice” has always seemed like a romantic death knell to me. Maybe she has good intentions, but the word “nice” has been forever tainted to me and I can’t help but see it as a warning that I will soon be single. The fact that she was in a fetal position in my bed, looking as if she was heavily debating something to herself did not reassure me.  I can also understand if she may be apprehensive about being too affectionate for fear of being taken advantage of.  Either way, this has been on my mind for a few days.

TL;DR: I (M/24) care for my girlfriend (F/24), whom I have a healthy, satisfying sex life with and who is generous, but her aloof behavior is making me question our future."

What do you think is the appropriate protocol for these recruiting events as a future intern?

Bonus question: I'm very interested in consulting, and after speaking with another firm, there might be a slight chance that by interviewing with them that I may be able to open that avenue for myself.

As the weeks have progressed however, I find myself crying more and more. Texting him that I miss him more and more and becoming upset when he doesn't text back. I even have his FB log in info (something he doesn't know) and cracked and went on it last night. I didn't find anything particularly gruesome to read, but I felt sick with myself afterwards. I've been trying to keep busy--in addition to graduating in a few months and having a job, I also got an internship which is proving to be an awesome experience. But I just don't know how to keep it together. I feel like as time goes on, instead of getting better, it's getting worse.

Advice, tips, any words would be greatly appreciated. "
le6rr,28,2011-10-16,Q&amp;A with Daniel Erickson.,[deleted],swtor,https://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/le6rr/qa_with_daniel_erickson/,"The following was posted on SWTOR's Facebook wall, lots of good questions and enticing answers! 



Thomas Haugeberg: Is there going to be an end for this game's story? Will one side rule in the end?



**Daniel: We know where the galaxy ends up in the next 3000 years but there's a long way to go until we get there and hopefully (since we all like our jobs) that story won't be ending anytime soon!**



Jason Trent: Are all ""romances"" with non-companion NPC's one night stands or are some of them fully fleshed out romances?



**Daniel: Some of them are long term romances, some actually spanning across several chapters.**



Travis Clay Henry: What character in ToR has been your favorite to write thus far?

**Daniel: Vette. Writing a complete character from start to finish is one of the most self-indulgent things we get to do as writers and Vette's strange romance path with a former master was an interesting challenge.**

Benjamin French: out of curiosity, will Advanced Class effect story? as an example, would a scoundrel play the same story a gunslinger would? or are the stories for scoundrels and gunslingers different?

**Daniel: Advanced classes are purely for gameplay. We didn't want players to restrict their gameplay choices due to story. The idea, in fact, was the opposite. We wanted people to be able to choose any class story in the game and then choose from a broad range of gameplay choices. Which is why we have six classes that can tank and six that can heal.**

Eric Baker: What advice might you have for someone interested in writing for video games (or even just writing in general)?

**Daniel: Write. All the time, as much as you can and in varied formats. Study screenwriting and classic dramatic structure. Get your basic craft and skills together. Join a writing group online. Having a smart group of people telling you how terrible you are will sharpen your skills infinitely faster than having your friends tell you how good you are.**

Matthew Myrick: Besides having fully voiced characters and a huge story, what would you say is one of the most exciting or unique aspects that cannot be found in any other MMO on the market?

**Daniel: Star Wars. From the ships to the companions to the operations, every minute of the game oozes Star Wars love. It really feels like you're in your own movie.**

Chris Cox: What was your first job and how did you get into the industry. Do you have any advice for people studying games design right now?

**Daniel: Well my very first job was McDonald's. I told them I was a vegetarian and I wouldn't work in the back and somehow they still hired me. I got written up three times more than was allowed before you were supposed to be fired and was still begged to stay when I left. Fast food memories. I got into the industry as an intern game critic, then a writer, than an editor, then to EA as an assistant producer, then designer, then lead designer then over to BioWare. If you want to get into the industry decide how badly you want to. More than friends? Family? Hometown? Set your priorities and then take every chance. Find small projects on kickstarter and volunteer your time. Make your own mods, work on your craft and take any job that can get you in the door.**

George B. Thomas: is there a chance that you can rebel from your initial alignment? ie: Jedi going dark or Sith going light in the future?

**Daniel: Yes, there's always time to fall or be redeemed.**

Daniel Fowler: @Erickson: Who is your favorite writer? What inspired you to become one?

**Daniel: I go through books so quickly it's hard to say. The ancient Greeks would have to be my first inspiration as I read the Greek mythology books over and over as a kid. If you want to write, read everything great from every genre you can stomach.**

Jessica Alexis: Will there be some ""perk"" at the end of your storyline depending on which path you take? Be it absolute Dark or absolute Light.

**Daniel: Nothing that affects gameplay to such a point as to make a ""wrong"" choice for raiding but there will be some cool stuff waiting for you.**

Russ Beardmaster Roach: From what I've seen, the dark side/sith is very well written and has multiple ""epic"" feels to it. How does the light side/jedi story differ, does it offer the same epic feeling to the lightside players and do you think the two are equally balanced in quality?

**Daniel: Absolutely. I think more attention from both fans and press have been paid to the Sith simply because the version of the Sith Empire we're presenting is new and therefore sparks curiosity. Our Jedi class stories are some of the most popular in testing and they have an amazing diversity both between them and inside each story for light and dark side approaches. These choices affect companions, story lines and even what titles you can gain and what position you'll eventually hold in the Jedi Order.**

Robert Diaz: Will there be a cosmetic costume option for players, so they can appear one way, and yet have the best equipment?

**Daniel: There is a route to do this, though not through the traditional appearance tab approach. We use the modding system to enable players to choose the core attributes of special sets of armor and cosmetic outfits so it's not only possible to keep that one really special set of Jedi robes all the way through the game, you can also, with a ton of work, be the person in the raid dressed as a slave girl or a sandperson.**

Dylan de Klerck: How do you feel now that the launch is right around the corner

**Daniel: Like an expectant father whose wife has been pregnant for six years. Nervous and bemused.**

Steve Sherring: Hello, will alignement be reflected on your characters face and posture as in Kotor 1+2 or will it only be represented by gear? thanks

**Daniel: Darkside changes will happen to your appearance as well.**

Anthony Humes: Is there really 200 of gameplay per class? And does that really mean there is 1600 hours of gameplay?

**Daniel: Some people have taken much longer than that to finish a single class story, some a bit less. We always avoid hard numbers for just that reason. Remember that only about 15% of your content later on is class content so the other content on your side will be the same. Which means it would take somewhere around that much time for the average player to play through all the classes but they wouldn't be doing all unique content for if it was all unique you couldn't play with your friends. What you do get, however, is unique class choices and dialogue even in the non-class content and, of course, 100% unique content between the two sides.**

A.j. Artiles: Will there be a ""hardcore"" difficulty for Flashpoints?

**Daniel: Yes, all of the 15 announced flashpoints are also playable at end game with harder difficulty modes and end game gear.**"
ldqwz,10,2011-10-15,Conflict of interest: I want to be an early education schoolteacher.,[deleted],vegan,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/ldqwz/conflict_of_interest_i_want_to_be_an_early/,"Hey everyone, thanks for clicking.

This is my dilemma. It is my dream to become an early education schoolteacher. Right now, I'm still an undergraduate, and I'm interning at a school with third grade students (8-9 years old). The school obviously serves all animal products as part of the lunch menu, and although I haven't checked into the menu further to see if there are alternative options, this actually isn't my concern.

The children I work with are amazing. They're a ton of fun, old enough not to act too wild, young enough that they aren't fully self-aware yet (they just say the most hilarious things, get up and dance, etc). Last week, a little girl asked me to read to her a book about the food pyramid (omnivorous). The teacher I intern with is an omnivore, she's near-elderly and not very openminded toward my lifestyle.

My current situation aside, when someday I'm teaching a class of my own, how should I deal with these issues? I obviously want to tell the kids what they're really eating are dead animals, breast milk, chicken menstruation, bone marrow, bee vomit, ETC. but would I get in trouble with the school? or their parents? They're so young that they don't know what they're eating, they don't even think about it.

Advice greatly, greatly appreciated. Thanks everyone."
ldmab,1,2011-10-15,IAmA 24 year old male who was blackmailed by someone posing as my ex girlfriend. AMA! ,[deleted],IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ldmab/iama_24_year_old_male_who_was_blackmailed_by/,"
This situation has had a profound effect on my life and I do not like to talk about it with my close family &amp; friends. However, I feel like it is the type of story people should know about and I think it can potentially help me, mentally speaking, to talk about it with my fellow redditors. This is a very long story, but it is such a crazy scenario that in order to understand the full level of craziness you must know the whole story.

In January of 2009 I met a girl - let's call her Molly. I met her through a friend at a New Year's Eve party. Right from the start I found her to be beautiful and intriguing. She was a senior at NYU and was majoring in the same subject as me, marketing. So there was an instant connection.

We began dating in mid-January and it lasted about three months. At the time I was a college student in upstate Connecticut and would routinely make trips to Manhattan to see her every weekend. We seemed to have a connection and got along great, however after about two months in to the relationship it became apparent that this type of long-term relationship wasn’t going to work out.

In the early weeks of March 2009 I began to initiate the gradual breakup. I am not good with confrontation and HATE breaking up with girls.  Seeing as I didn’t want to hurt the girl’s feelings, I decided I would just be a “bad boyfriend” until she got fed up enough to break up with me. (In retrospect I should have handled this differently)

Unfortunately for me, the less I acted like a good boyfriend; the more she wanted to be with me. She started calling me dozens of times a day, and texting me lengthy messages asking why I haven’t called her back and what not. Eventually I couldn’t do that to her anymore and decided it was time to break it off. So one night in March, I called her up with the intention of breaking up with her and she, on the other hand, had different hopes for this conversation. Right before I told her I wanted to break up, she told me she was in love with me. What a disaster this was. After about two hours of presenting her with reasons for the breakup, and after her providing counterarguments as to why we should stay together – we eventually came to an agreement and ended the relationship.

In the weeks that followed she started to act really crazy.  Molly went on a streak of nonstop phone calls, encyclopedia-length text messages, emails, facebook messages, etc. All of which were comprised of her pleas to get back together. As I mentioned earlier, I do not like confrontation – so what did I do? I completely and utterly ignored her. Like, seriously. I changed my phone number, deactivated my facebook, blocked her from my email – I know, these are all dick moves and I truly felt terrible about how I handled this situation- but at this point I felt as if I was past the point of no return and had no choice but to continue with my unorthodox methods. I knew I was making her upset but I thought it was the right thing to do in the long-run and that she would get over it eventually.

After about a solid month of ignoring her, her attempts to contact me began to subside. It seemed like she was beginning to get over me and move on with her life. I started to feel less guilty about how I handled things and moved on with my life. I was nearing the end of the semester and I needed to get an internship in order to graduate the following year.  So from here on out, finding an internship was all I cared about.

Luckily for me, my next-door neighbor back home (lets call him Tom) happened to be a SVP at a prominent PR firm in Manhattan. He heard about my need for an internship and immediately offered me a position.  I called him while I was still at school and he informed me I would be starting on June 1st, 2009. I was so pumped.

So fast-forward a little bit here to mid June. I had now been working at this PR firm for a few weeks, and to my (and everyone else’s) surprise, I was doing extremely well. It seemed I was a natural in the PR industry and everyone in the company was taking notice, especially the SVP (my neighbor.) Within two weeks I had closed my first major account and it became apparent to me that I wanted a career in this industry.

The night after closing the big account my neighbor/boss invited me over for dinner. Though he and his family had lived next to me for a few years, I didn’t really know too much about the guy. He always seemed very nice, but there was something off about him. Everyone who met the guy said the same thing, “nice guy, but he seems kind of weird.” After working with him for a few weeks he seemed to have taken a strong liking towards me. He told me he wanted me to be his “prodigy” and he told me to do whatever he told me to do. He said if I followed his lead, he would make me a star before I turned 25.

I was so excited. I had a great internship and a boss who loved me and wanted to give me the express ride to the top. Since I wanted to be successful more than anything in life, I decided I would learn as much as I could from this man and indeed do whatever he told me to. 

While I continued to work at the company throughout the Summer I began to become very close friends with my neighbor/boss. Though he was 32, married, and had kids and I was 21-year-old college kid we seemed to get along very well. One thing that always kind of freaked me out, though, was that he was always asking me VERY personal questions. He seemed to be intrigued with my sexual life and was constantly asking about it. Seeing as I knew this guy was my ticket to the top, I usually told him everything he wanted to know…including the juicy details.

Despite my ambition to be a success in the PR industry, sometimes I couldn’t handle the things he would want to talk about. Among MANY other things, he was constantly asking me how big my penis is, how often I masturbated and if I would ever consider having a threesome with him and his wife. In addition to these invasive questions, he would want to hang out everyday after work and every weekend. By early July I was seriously beginning to believe this man was obsessed with me. 

Now I know this story seems like it’s going on forever, but the weird stuff didn’t start until July 10 2009.  On July 10, 2009 I received an email at the office from some weird address (something like Sexxxychic69) that said nothing but the following:

 “You fucked with the wrong chick.” 

Obviously confused, I write back to this person asking who it is. I was hoping someone just got their email addresses mixed, but deep down I knew something was wrong. I receive another email from the same person saying, “You fucked with me. Now I am going to ruin your life.” 

At this point, I think it is just some of my friends fucking with me so I just ignore it, block the email address and get back to work. I go home, and sneak in to my house so my neighbor/boss didn’t see me – this was something I had to do every night or else he would try to hang out with me all night. Once I get inside I turn on the TV and start to dose off – that is until my dog starts barking furiously at something outside the window..

I get up off the couch and go to investigate and to my amazement/horror, I see my boss’ fat face peering through my windows. I immediately run outside to confront him and ask him what the hell he is doing looking through my windows! He goes on to tell me that he just wanted to see if I was home and if I wanted to come over and have some wine and watch the Yankee game. Obviously, I am a little sketched out by his action and I decline his invitation and decide to go to bed after a very long, and unusual day with the hopes that the next day would be normal. Oh, how I was wrong.

I go in to work the next morning to find my inbox flooded with messages from a new email address, but obviously the same person. They all came in from 9PM – 1AM of the previous evening. This time the messages are must more malicious.

Most of the messages had similar content and were as follows: (I’m paraphrasing)

“You think you can ignore me!? I will make your life hell if you don’t do what I tell you!”

“Still not answering? You’ll be sorry you little shit”
My heart began to beat faster after every message I read until I got to the last one. Upon reading the last one my heart just plain stopped. This email read as follows: “I didn’t want to have to do this but if you do not reply to me in the next 24 hours I will reach out to your family, friends, and coworkers (In the email my entire family’s full names and contact info were listed; the same goes for friends and coworkers) with the photo I have attached to this message.” I could barely operate the mouse because I was shaking so badly – before I even opened the photo I had an idea what is was.

I open the photo and to my astonishment it is a screen cap from a sextape I had made with Molly months earlier. This photo clearly showed my face and genitals.  At this point I am crying – I do not know what the fuck to do. So many things were running through my head.  Before I can gather my thoughts I receive another email from this person. 

“By now you must know I am not fucking around. If you would like to stop me from sending your mother, father, little brothers, cousins, bosses, coworkers, friends a picture of you and your cock, you will do exactly what I say. Love, Molly”

Now what is someone supposed to do when they receive a message like that. I didn’t know where to turn. I couldn’t go to my parents for help, it was humiliating - I couldn’t go to my friends for the same reason. The only person I felt I could trust was Tom, my boss.

With my heart beating at a million miles an hour I sprint to by bosses office and burst out in to tears explaining to him the situation. Now my boss and I had previously talked about this girl Molly in detail, so he knew the background to the situation. Completely clueless, I ask Tom what I should do – he replies, “dude you need to do whatever she tells you to.”  Unhappy with that answer I stand up and say, “Fuck that! I am going to the cops right now! I’m not letting this bitch ruin my life!”
Once I said that, the look in Tom’s eyes changed from worried to angry. He flipped out on me and told me the last thing I should do is go to the cops because it would “bring bad press to the company.” He told me if I went to the police he would have to terminate my intern position at the company.  Still in shock, I wiped the tears off my face and went back to my office to try and make sense of all of this.

Before I can even sit down I hear the “ding” of my Microsoft Outlook, notifying me of a new message. (By the way, to this day the sound of that “ding” HAUNTS me) I didn’t even have to look; I knew it was from her. So I open the message and begin to read what I found to be this person’s “terms of agreement.” In order to prevent her from sending out the picture I had to follow her instructions diligently. She demanded that I take 5 pictures of my penis and then send them to her. She wanted two pictures of my flaccid penis, and three while it was erect – and they all had to be at different angles. Seriously folks, I COULD NOT make this shit up…and it gets better…

After reading her demands I become filled with rage. I think to myself, “how am I letting this psycho bitch do this to me!?” I decide that I need to put an end to this bullshit.  I write her back an email asking why she is doing this to me, while also informing her that I would NOT be sending her any pictures. I ended the message with, “PS. if I heard from you again I will call the police and I will have you arrested. Don’t test me.”

Within five minutes I received a response from her. The message consisted of two words: “Big Mistake.” About five minutes after reading this, my Boss calls my line and furiously demands that I go to his office to talk to him. He sounded really mad. When I walk in to his office, he gives me a sharp look and turns his computer monitor so I can see what he is looking at. It was the picture of me.

He shut the door to his office and proceeded to scream at me. He told me how he had just received this email, and he wasn’t the only other person to receive it.  As I looked to see who else was on the recepitant list I felt my stomach start to turn. In addition to Tom getting the nude picture of me, the CEO, CFO and Creative Director were ALL on the list. I start to puke in his garbage can and he tells me how he was able to log on to the network and delete the email from everybody’s inbox – preventing anyone else from seeing it.

Though it appeared he saved my ass there, he was still furious that I didn’t listen to him. He asked me what this person was demanding I do, so I told him about the 5 pic request. After hearing what I told him, he demanded that I go to the bathroom and take the pictures and “get it over with.”

I was obviously very uncomfortable with this, so before succumbing to his demands, I proposed involving the police again. Tom started flipping out again telling me how that is out of the question. I didn’t really understand why he was SO against it, but I trusted him. So I did what I thought was the only thing left to do. I went to the bathroom and proceeded to take pictures of my penis. Tears are streaming down my face as I take them, and I was having trouble getting an erection. This wasn’t exactly an arousing situation.

So I finally am able to take the pictures and I send them to Molly. In the email I ask her to please leave me alone for the rest of my life. She responds saying thank you for the pictures, and she explains that she wanted the pictures to have something to masturbate to – she then says “consider this my last correspondence” and I never heard from her again.

After that day I was never the same. Weeks went by without hearing from Molly and it appeared it was all over. However, I had developed severe anxiety from this situation and literally jumped out of my seat every time I heard a “new mail” notification.  I became very depressed and developed a phobia of talking to any girls – I guess I was afraid something similar would happen if I got in another relationship. I couldn’t sleep at night. I couldn’t focus at work. I just wasn’t myself.  Even though it was “over” – something about the whole situation just didn’t seem right to me. I know that Molly was kind of crazy but I still couldn’t see her doing all of the things she did. Something just didn’t feel right about the whole thing. I had this overwhelming feeling that Tom had SOMETHING to do with what happened.  I even approached Tom, very timidly, and asked him if he had anything to do with what happened. However, every time that I made even a slight, subtle suggestion that I thought Tom may have had something to do with it, he would get very angry and accuse me of being crazy. Eventually he told me that if I could not trust him that we would not be able to work together. So I dropped it and tried to move on with my life.

In the months that followed that traumatizing experience, I turned to drugs to ease the anxiety. I needed to load myself up on painkillers and benzodiazepines just to be able to fall asleep without having nightmares about what happened. As a result of drug use and increasingly worse depression, my production at work took a nosedive. One rainy morning in November of 2009, Tom brought me in to his office and told me that if I didn’t pick up my production in the next few weeks he would have to let me go. I was devastated and tried to tell him that I just haven’t been right, mentally speaking, since July when everything went down. He told me I needed to put it behind me and that he would do anything to help. He even offered to let me work in his private office over the next week while he was traveling. His office was secluded in the building and it was nice to work in there because you could concentrate without any distractions. So I took him up on his offer and the next day I came in to work and set up shop at his desk.

After a morning of trying to catch up on my work, I decided to have lunch in Tom’s office rather than go out to eat. As I was fixing up my turkey sandwich I noticed a folder on his desktop that had a peculiar title, “Yankees.” Now, if you knew Tom you would know that he is the least athletic person in the world and would only watch the Yankees to try and impress me. Something about that folder just didn’t seem right to me. So I opened it. 

In the folder I found the 5 picture of my penis that I sent to Molly, and ONLY Molly. In addition to the pictures I also found the full-length sextape video file of Molly and myself. Suddenly everything made sense.  This sick bastard went on to my email that I, stupidly, had left open on his laptop back in May. He scowered through my files and came across the sex tape. He then used a picture from the video to make me believe that the only person that could possibly have that video was Molly. He then took advantage of the trust I had placed in him, knowing I would do whatever he said, and blackmailed me in to sending him pictures of my penis. He knew enough about Molly from what I had told him to formulate an evil alter ego with the sole intention of satisfying his homosexual feelings towards me. I was in absolute shock.

It took all the strength I had to not burst in to tears right there on the spot. With the last ounce of effort I had, I informed the higher-ups that I would be leaving the company for personal reasons and got in my car and drove home. When I got home I looked my mother in the eyes and just lost it. I told her everything. We were on our front porch, smoking a cigarette and discussing what our options were when we saw Tom’s white Acura pull in to our drive way. At this point, Tom had no clue I knew, and he wanted to talk to me about my decision to leave the company. As he exited the car and started walking towards us, I quickly tried to think of the most hurtful/badass thing I could say to him at that moment, when suddenly my Mom jumps in and screams, “If you take one step closer to my son I will rip your heart out with my bare hands!!!!”

I have never seen a grown man look so scared. I wish I had thought of something to say too, but I was just so mentally exhausted. I simply got up and walked inside without so much as even looking at him. I wish I could have seen his face at the exact moment he realized he was caught, but at this point I couldn’t even look at him.

The next day (November 11, 2009) my mother and I went to speak to our town’s Police Department. Unfortunately, they didn’t have a cyber crimes unit so the referred us to a few towns over. After a long day of listening to policemen state their opinions on the matter, I began to worry that there would be nothing I could do and he would get away with everything.

But then the phone rang. The Lt. of the cyber crimes division of the Connecticut State Police had heard about my predicament through the people I spoke with at my town’s Police department. She felt so strongly about the case that she decided to take it on personally. She promised me she would bring this man to justice for what he did, and hearing that gave me the first sense of relief in months.

Two weeks after I left the company, Tom put his house on the market. Two months after I left, the Connecticut State Police raided his house and confiscated all of his electronics for further investigation. The whole neighborhood saw him in cuffs, watching helplessly as 18 uniformed officers tore through his home. It was great. Six months after I left, Tom and his family moved – though, from what I’ve heard through the grapevine it doesn’t sound like he will have much of a family left. Apparently his wife thought his obsession with me was a tad strange too. I am still waiting for the final charges to be brought to him, but when they do I’ll be there.

I’m sorry for this absurdly long story, but I felt like I had to get it off my chest. Believe it or not, I left several other things out and tried to focus on the most important aspects. This man is a terrible person and my life has really taken a tale spin since everything happened. I am working hard to move past everything, but it is easier said than done.  If anyone found this even slightly interesting please feel free to ask me ANY questions.



TL;DR:  
•	I dated a girl for 3 months, she became kind of obsessive so I broke up with her.  Months later I am working at an internship and start to receive threatening emails demanding I send pictures of my penis to this person who wont give me her name. 

•	The person says if I do not comply with the demands she will send a naked picture of me to everyone I know. I want to go to the police, but my boss at the company says I have to do whatever this person says. 

•	I humiliate myself by taking and sending the pictures to a person who later reveals herself to be the girl I was dating months before.

•	I do more investigating and find out the whole time I was receiving these threatening messages that it WASN’T my ex-girlfriend, but in fact it was my boss pretending to be my ex in order to see me naked. 

•	I got the police involved and now this dude is gonna be FUCKED.

lfk96,3,2011-10-17,"College student here, need help starting out! (Long post but please bear with me)[HELP]",AnotherCollegeGuy,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/lfk96/college_student_here_need_help_starting_out_long/,"*Apologies in advance for the long post.*

Okay so I'm currently a sophomore in college. I'm a guy, just under 6', and last i checked somewhere between 190 and 200 (i don't have a scale at school). 

Up through freshman year of high school I had been a little skinny kid. I ate whatever I wanted, exercised some and played some sports, although not super heavily, and my metabolism took care of the rest. Since then, my metabolism has slowed down, I stopped playing sports (lost interest when things got too competitive in high school, I was never a huge sports guy), and have been gaining weight, slowly but surely. I'd say probably around 60 pounds since the end of my freshman year of high school. 

Not all of this weight was bad, I'm definitely bigger in general than I was, and I don't expect to be down to 140 again really, but after coming to school it's just gotten to be more than I would like. Last year was the first I've been away from home for an extended time. A campus meal plan was not a good thing for my weight. For the entire first semester of my freshman year of college, I did little to no real exercise, and ate basically whatever I wanted. I would say I definitely put on the ""freshman 15"" which combined with the extra weight I had put me over the edge. I had always told myself that I wouldn't get over 200, and when I stepped on the scale last winter break and surpassed that, I knew I had to do something.

For the second semester last year, I changed up my habits. I got a membership to the gym, and started to watch what I ate. I worked out probably 3-5 times a week, usually spending some time on an elliptical and lifting some weights (i really hate running). This definitely helped and I stopped gaining weight, but I didn't really lose anything. This was frustrating to me.

By the summer, I was still around 205-210, and really not enjoying it. I started up with an internship and it turns out two of my coworkers had just started up a weight loss routine. They said they got this program called ""insanity"" and were watching what they ate and both dropped 10 pounds or so in somewhere around 2 weeks (I was under the impression from the way they looked that they were not really overweight, just out of shape.) 

This inspired me. I picked up the insanity workout, and decided to give it a shot. I started working out to the video, and really started watching my diet. The regular work schedule helped a lot. A big focus of insanity is to eat multiple small meals throughout the day rather than a few large ones. Before I started the actual workout I had gotten into a routine of a breakfast, typically some cereal, a mid morning snack of a granola bar, or some fruit (banana, apple, orange usually), had a lunch of usually a turkey sandwich on whole wheat with another piece of fruit, an afternoon snack of a yogurt, and whatever my mom made me for dinner after work. 

I started the workout program, and stuck to it for about a week and a half. The problem was, it was heavily focused on jumping, and stupid me decided not to wear shoes, so my shins started bothering me to the point where I had to stop. When I was on the program, I was losing about a pound a day, and after two weeks, I managed to drop down below 200, I believe i was down to about 192. 

The rest of the summer I never really got back into the workouts, as it took a little while for my shins to get better, but I kept up with my diet, and kept my weight down around 193.

I'm back at school now, but this year I'm living off campus. I don't have a meal plan, so I have free reign to cook whatever I want. I haven't joined the gym, and to be honest, I don't really intend to. Every time I went last year I dreaded it, and the results never really showed. I'm not really interested in putting on muscle, as I am already somewhat muscular (although not defined), I just want to lose weight.

Right now my diet, while not terrible, is not the best. Because it is cheap and easy to make (and my roommates eat it daily), I feel like I have been eating a lot of pasta, which I do not think it is good. Ive also been eating a decent amount of eggs, making some wraps (usually turkey, cheese, banana peppers and lettuce), having veggie burgers on those whole wheat sandwich thins, and cooking some breaded chicken and a few other various things. 

My question to all of you on loseit is this: what can i do to make my diet better, while still keeping it relatively cheap and easy to make? I can cook fairly well, but I don't really have the time to spend hours on meals every day. I know my diet is a lot better than it used to be, but i really want to improve it. 

Also, what can I do to get some exercise keeping in mind that running is really not for me. I am getting a drumset for my apartment soon, so i am really hoping that will be a big help for cardio (any other drummers out there know what I mean), and I still have the insanity videos, and have been thinking about starting that up again, but do you have any other tips or tricks?

I am really hoping to get down around 40-50 pounds total, which would be great by the summer. Any general weight loss tips would be greatly appreciated, especially from someone in a similar situation. Thanks for taking the time to read all of this!

**TL;DR** 6' 195 lb. college student in an apartment with free reign over food, hate running (but if it absolutely comes down to it, i'm willing to give it a shot), no gym membership, would like to knock off 40-50 lbs by the summer."

Hi FAers, so I want to tell you a story that is similar to many of yours. The story of a guy who liked a girl, spoke his heart to her and got shut down in the end. The reason I'm typing this is because it has been haunting my mind for a month and hope this will be cathartic. Also, if anyone actually makes it through this essay and has some feedback, please let me know.

**Chapter 1**

The story begins about 2 years ago when I first met this girl, let's call her Sarah. We had a class together and I would always sit in the front because of my poor eyesight. Sarah would sit farther back in the lecture hall with some of her friends. We lived our separate, non-overlapping lives until a month into the semester, when she randomly makes fun of me for always sitting in the front. It was in a coy, playful manner so I just laughed it off with some self-deprecating humor. Then next class, she's sitting up front with me and I jump on the clear signal. She was definitely cute and seemed like a nice girl. As we leave the hall, I make fun of her for being a hypocrite and initiate a conversation. We end up walking all the way to our college diner and eating lunch together. If I thought her appearance was good, her personality was amazing. She was smart, funny, open-minded, and even played Super Smash Bros. Melee (my favorite game of all time). She asked me for my number before I even got the chance, and from that day, we became close friends.

Sarah started sitting next to me during lecture everyday, and we hung out regularly outside of class. Things were going great and I was quickly falling for the girl. Then about two weeks later, we were walking to the diner after class when she casually drops the two words every FAer dreads: my boyfriend. Turns out she’s in a relationship with some dude from my high school. Even with my hopes dashed, I continue on with the friendship like nothing changed. We evolve to the point where we tell each other pretty much everything: our dreams, fears, weaknesses. Sarah frequently complained about her boyfriend to me, but of course she clung on to him through all the abuse.

**Chapter 2**

 About a year later, we got into our first fight when I accused her of deliberately befriending intelligent people to give herself an advantage in classes (not to sound cocky, but I am pretty smart). It was me being jealous because I saw her talking to other smart guys in our major. Sarah denied my accusation and started crying. I asked her why she had first started talking to me then, and she admitted it was because she had found me attractive and wanted to get to know me better. I was taken aback and didn’t really know how to respond. I could not make any advances on her because she was still in a relationship, so I just let the issue drop and things went back to normal.

**Chapter 3:**

Fast forward another year, and it’s now the summer of 2011. I was away for a summer internship so I had not seen or heard from Sarah for a while. She IM’s me out of the blue one night telling me she is going to break up with her bf for good. Sarah was feeling suffocated in the relationship and could not let the noose tighten any longer. The only problem was that she had emailed her soon-to-be ex-boyfriend some explicit pictures earlier in the relationship and was worried he would release them after they broke up. As a result, she wanted me to tell her how to hack into his email address and delete those pictures. Being an amateur hacker back in high school, I walked her through the steps and she was able to successfully eradicate the photographs. She broke up with her boyfriend the next day.

Our friendship rekindled that summer even though we were hundreds of miles away. I talked to her for hours online on a regular basis and started acting more flirtatious. Sarah’s birthday was in June, so when I came home for July 4th weekend, I took her out to the bars and had a great time with her. She was all over me, stroking my hair and marveling over my biceps (I had been working out over the summer). I knew she got very flirtatious when drunk so I did not think too much about it, but I definitely enjoyed the intimacy. 

I went back to my internship and thought about Sarah more than ever. Our chats became the highlight of my day and I was planning how I would ask her out when I returned home. The problem was that after two years of having a controlling boyfriend, Sarah was thoroughly enjoying the freedom of single life and told me she was not looking for a relationship anytime soon. Nonetheless, we continued talking and she repeatedly claimed how excited she was for my return. I resolved to tell her my feelings even if she did not want a relationship. I mean hey, she wasn’t opposed to a FWB.

**Chapter 4**

My internship concluded and I had two weeks left at home before the fall semester begins. The day after I came home, I met Sarah for dinner and it went great. She invited me over to her apartment to play Super Smash Bros. afterwards and insisted that I accompany her to her neighbor’s party tomorrow. I happily obliged and decided I would make my move at the party. The big night arrived and I met Sarah at the party with a bottle of Captain Morgan, her favorite. The party was a cock-fest and pretty boring, but I just enjoyed being with Sarah. Once again, she had her hands on me all night. We went drink for drink and Sarah got pretty wasted. I was still sober thanks to a tolerance built up over a summer of consuming copious alcohol. I was planning to just drive home, but Sarah insisted I stay overnight. We end up going back to her room and messing around on her laptop, posting inappropriate Facebook statuses, etc. She shows me the explicit pictures she had sent her ex-boyfriend, and at this point it becomes clear to me that she’s still interested in me. Nonetheless, I was reluctant to hook up with her because of her intoxicated state and instead we just end up cuddling.

The next morning, my heart is pounding audibly as I realize the moment has finally come. I drink a glass of water, and as I walk towards the door, I turn around and finally spill my heart out to her. I went over the words so many times I have them memorized. I said: “Sarah, you’re beautiful, smart, caring, and one of the few people in the world I feel comfortable telling anything to. I know you’re not interested in a relationship, but I just wanted you to know I like you a lot. In fact, I’ve liked you since the day I met you. I have wanted to tell you for a long time, and now that you are single, I feel comfortable getting this off my chest.” She tells me she likes me too and appreciates the fact that I am not pressuring her into a relationship. As I walk out, she calls my name and runs to give me a hug and a kiss on the cheek. I felt on top of the world on the drive back home, optimistic of what way come. 

**Chapter 5**

My dreams are soon dampened as Sarah barely talks to me afterwards and our conversations become awkward and formal. I have no idea what is wrong because things seemed so great when I left her apartment, but I try not to analyze it too much. Then came the proverbial nail in the coffin. Next week, a mutual friend has a birthday party. I arrive to see Sarah talking to some guy. She comes over to say hi and gives me a stiff hug, then goes back to the other guy. They talk and dance throughout the party and the only sentence she says to me over the night is “are you having fun?” I leave early, too upset to have fun. The next day I call her out for her behavior over the past week. She admits that she is keeping a distance because she does not want to be involved intimately with me. I tell her I don’t understand why that is an issue if she claims to like me too. Her response: “If I go out with a guy and we break up, I sever all ties with him. You are too important in my life for me to take that risk.” 

Translation: You’ve been friend-zoned.

Despite this deafening blow, I like Sarah enough to want to maintain the platonic relationship we had going. I gave her an ultimatum – either you start talking to me normally like before or don’t talk to me at all. She agrees to stop being distant. We meet for dinner around the second week of the semester. Things seem back to normal and the dinner goes by fluidly. I invite her for a party in my apartment the next day, and she promises to stop by. As I should have expected, Sarah doesn’t come and makes up an excuse about how she couldn’t find anyone to come with.

Then a friend, who knows I like Sarah, tells me how she saw Sarah last night holding hands with some guy. It turns out she is now going out with the guy she met at the party. I feel a huge knot in my stomach that I cannot get rid of. Even as I type this, that knot reemerges and I feel an oppressive heaviness. Anger blended with sadness to form a vitriolic concoction that left me dizzy with passion. Imagining her hooking up with another guy made me feel sick, and at that moment I realized just how hard I had fallen for her. I blocked her on Facebook and removed her from my phone. And that was it. I have not spoken to her for a month, but there is not a day when I don’t think of her. The End."
lgd5i,9,2011-10-18,Getting a grip on my LIFE... ,chrismsx,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/lgd5i/getting_a_grip_on_my_life/,"**I need to vent...** I’m going to write out a few issues I’m having as topics and small paragraphs. You can choose to help with any or everything if you feel so moved. 

First let me say, *I have a good life.* My problems are things other people wish they had to deal with and I am not throwing myself a pity party.  I do however feel the need to get this off my chest as my brain has felt very fuzzy lately and I’m hoping writing all this out will help me de-fuzz and gain some clarity and focus. 

**Working out **
All last year I was a fitness nut. I refused to eat fast food, worked out 3 days a week at the least and counted calories.  This year I’ve fallen totally off the wagon. Now I’m lucky in that I haven’t gained any weight  but I feel like I need to pick it back up before I do. I’ve already lost a lot of the muscle I built last year.  Ultimately I feel like a failure for everyday that I don’t get back on the ball. I’ve been saying every week for months now that I was going to start over and I keep fudging. 

**Job**
I am a graphic designer. I’ve been working at a place full time as a contractor for 3 years. I was promised they would hire me on full time a year ago. It hasn’t happened.  However this is a Godsend because as I look around the company, I don’t see any where I’d like to be promoted to. Most of my superiors are hitting retirement age in about 2-3 years and  I know I don’t want their jobs. In fact I’ve come to the conclusion that I don’t want to work for this company. I’m bored and the company culture sucks. I’m turning 27 at the end of this month, so I’m no spring chicken but everyone one here is old. ALL the young people that I make friends with get new jobs within a year and leave.  I’ve only stayed behind because it’s REALLY good money, I’m awesome at what I do and I get lot’s of opportunities because the Marketing director views me as a technical whiz kid. They let me do everything from video production to UI Design. My primary job is to create print collateral and layout pages but I so so much more than that. Here I am king of the castle. I teach my boss things and I am not challenged in anyway. I make my own hours and I do what I want.  It sounds great but  again, I’m bored and I’m the type of person that likes having issues to solve and work that’s satisfying. 

**Looking For a New Job** 
As of last month I decided to look for something new.  I’m currently in the midst of applying to marketing and design agencies/firms (and occasionally big companies). I’ve found the process to be enjoyable but it’s also reviving a monster I haven't seen in a while, self doubt. 

**Resume**
Thanks to the monster revival I decided to completely rewrite my resume.  Which I still question because my old resume got me 3 interviews a week after releasing it into the wild but I just felt like I could do something better. It’s taken me two weeks.  Not because I’m a slow writer, but because I’ve been taking my time to craft something effective and concise.  I want to provide enough information to get responses from job search engines but not so much that it turns off the firms. I crowd sourced my resume on Reddit and once it passed the bar I moved on to the cover letter.  

**Cover Letter**
I never know what to write, except that they need to be error free.  I hire editors to proof all of my freelance design work and even my resume. In the case of my cover letters I’ve opted not to hire an editor and instead carefully proof my own work because I don’t want to pay money every single time I apply to a job.  Plus I craft new cover letters for each position because I was told employers can tell when you’ve used a form letter. *I just don't know what to write that will be effective!* 

**Finding the Jobs** 
I’ve been using Indeed.com and searching for firms via Google and Reddit. My main issue is I’m not sure what positions to focus on because I’ve been done so much. Also what sucks is a lot of the jobs I want are for Junior and Senior designers. Mid Level’s are rarely mentioned  and if we are we’re lumped in with Juniors.  

**Pay Cut**
I literally cannot afford a pay cut. I got married last year and we have no real debt except for student loans and my car note (which I could pay off right now but it would wipe our savings).  It makes it hard to take jobs or internships that will pay off later because we can’t not pay our loans.  Other stuff could be handled by moving in with my parents for a little bit but that’s barely an option because I’m 90% sure my wife would hate the idea.

**Turning 27**
It makes 30 feel so much closer and makes me feel like I’m not accomplishing anything worthwhile in my career.  This isn’t where I pictured myself at 27. Corporate america yes, but I thought I’d be at a rockstar firm crafting innovative ideas not designing interfaces for a dms and making catalogs for office supplies. It makes me feel like I need to get to the top of the mountain before I turn 30 and my youth is no longer an asset. (Even though I’ve heard people call 30 year old young and I can make myself like 19 by shaving haha. 

**Freelance**
Oh! I also freelance, usually at night. I make extra money and I pick my own projects. Lately, I’ve been thinking about  just starting my own branding and logo design company but I’m not sure where to start or where to get credibility. Like who’s going to spend 5-10k on branding from some kid who’s only been doing this 4 years and such. I might make a website and pitch it like a firm but it’s all up in the air. 

**Moving**
I should mention also, that I’d like to move to California or work in downtown Chicago. I’ve found it difficult to get a call back from anyone in California. I’ve applied to jobs I was insanely qualified for and I’ve gotten nothing. I was told to use a California address and explain that I’m moving to that state and I’m paying my own relocation fees.  I haven’t tried that yet but it makes me nervous. 

**YouTube** 
This whole time I’ve been making YouTube videos and while I’ve had a few very minor hits, I keep getting discouraged because I haven’t had that “viral video” I expected. I think my problem is I shouldn’t be expecting anything. However this feeling of my stuff not being good enough has made it difficult to create anything. Like I get tapped for ideas. I constantly need to remind myself to stay in my own bubble because when I look at other people’s numbers I start feeling inadequate.  ( I average like 400 hits... Maybe less with 580 subscribers)  Which if you know YouTube is normal. Rarely do all your subs watch your videos. I’ve noticed that people with 4,000 subscribers will sometimes average 1,000 hits  so I guess I shouldn’t feel too bad when a video I make maxes out at 200.

Ex: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybtS-tuRy4Y

**Gaming**
There are a lot of games coming out and they are all awesome and I can’t find the time to play them all. Like I got Gears of War 3 and started playing last week,  but now Batman Arkham Asylum came out today...which means I’m only weeks removed from BF3 &amp; MW3...and even later Zelda: SS. It sounds silly but trying to manage what systems to buy games for and when to play them so you don’t get left behind the other people playing online.  

**Wife**
Gotta make time to spend with her and not make her feel like a side option. It’s hard though because admittedly everything else feels urgent and her needs don’t but that certainly not true. I’ve been good about it lately but I always feel like I’m missing out on something when we’re spending the day bumming around. 

**The Plan**
I’ve trying to devise a plan to help solve all my problems like scheduling my time between projects for every day of the week and structuring something to make looking for a job more manageable along with everything else going on. "

lfwx0,1,2011-10-17,Need some advice from you lovely ladies who have been through the stresses of college.,organicky,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/lfwx0/need_some_advice_from_you_lovely_ladies_who_have/,"This is quite clearly a throwaway. Honestly, I am so embarrassed that I am having this problem.
I'm a senior in college and I am studying hard science. I enjoy learning, and usually I'm good at it. I have always made good grades, but it's not because I am all that smart. I have to study hard and often, particularly for math-based subjects. I am having real, very serious trouble in physics. 


Background: The professor is Russian. The class is general physics I, but he teaches it like we're all aiming to become professional physicists. He is extremely blunt and rude when approached. If you go to him for help, nstead of saying, 'Oh, you wrote the formula down wrong,' he says, 'Who taught you this? I did not teach you this. Listen to me when I teach you.'  I put ~2 hours into physics every day. I just can’t retain anything I read or practice, mainly because I don’t understand the application.


It is *extremely* important for me to succeed (that's another issue). I feel badly enough that I haven't been able to get a handle on physics, to the point where I cry every time I try to do my homework. It just makes me feel worse when I ask him a question and he talks to me like I'm an idiot who wants to personally insult him by failing his class.


So what brought this whole situation to a head was an incident in lab today. The three people in my lab group were working formulas, and we all completely forgot how to calculate experimental error. We've all worked with it since high school, but none of us could remember it off the top of our heads. Another person in the group asked him if he could refresh our memory, and he said, ""Are you really telling me that you don't know how to do experimental error? Is that really what you're saying? NO, NO, I will not help you with this. We are halfway through the semester. You should know how to do this."" And he walked away. 


We were the last group to be in the lab and he yelled at us to hurry up. We handed in our report as the professor of the next class came in. Our professor took our report right over to the other physics professor, opened it, and (while we were ALL still standing right there) proceeded to make fun of how we didn't know how to do something as simple as experimental error and talk about how incompetent we were. They both laughed. I just stood there, horrified and humiliated, as tears welled up in my eyes. 


I cried for close to three hours because I was upset that I can’t get physics and even more upset at being humiliated for forgetting something simple. Forgetting simple things is not a huge deal to me. I do projects and reports in groups and we forget little things all the time—the molarity of water, the atomic number of nitrogen, etc. We ask, we get an answer, we say, “Oh yeah, that’s right,” and we move on. No one thinks anyone is stupid for asking.


Like I said, I already beat myself to shit over not understanding physics. I can't eat, I try to think while I'm sleeping so I hardly sleep, and I have started having seizures (stress is a trigger for me) again after being seizure-free for 6 months (I'm epileptic).  Having seizures affects me for 1-3 days depending on the magnitude, so the stress is also indirectly affecting me in my other classes and at my internship.


My question is this: **How do you draw the line between pushing past a subject that is difficult and obsessing over it in order to succeed, and accepting that a subject is not for you, being okay with that, and not letting it stress you out?**


 I have always subscribed to the former, but a friend who has already had the class told me that she got through it because she didn't care. She knew that knowing the acceleration of a penny in free fall wasn't going to be important, so she put physics on the back burner to focus on her biology courses. It makes sense to me, but I'm stuck. Do I continue to stress over not getting physics, or do I say ""fuck it"" and make sure I soak up as much knowledge as I can in my other, more relevant classes? And is there anything I can do about my asshole professor? I have to take him again for physics II!


I’m sorry about the length. It has been a horribly emotional and stressful day and I just need some supportive women (and men!) to cry to.

lho4b,1,2011-10-19,An intellectual revolution has begun....,[deleted],AmericanGovernment,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmericanGovernment/comments/lho4b/an_intellectual_revolution_has_begun/,"The pirates who have hijacked this country, and its citizens will not give it up without a last-man standing fight... we’re talking about the same people who would rather implode the fictitious world economy than sacrifice a little for the benefit of anyone other than themselves. The same people who build 2 billion dollar stealth aircraft to shoot million dollar missiles into a hut that cost two sticks and a stone… Unfortunately ""these people"" are ourselves. We are at war within our own minds… against each other.

Take for example if you were to ask 1,000 people if they like to live and breathe. It’s a law of nature that at least one or two of the thousand would say adamantly reject the notion of living and breathing being good. If as those 2 people, I can control the information that flows to the other 998 people, I can through the means of communication convince 35% of the 998 people who are unskilled in critical thought that not living or breathing is in their best interest, and that the other 65% were in some sort of conspiracy against them. I would present not living and breathing as the better argument, because the 65% were in unison, not presenting a fair and balanced position.

This is an intellectual revolution… and so it has begun. We are witnessing history.

This is an unprecedented look at the fall of an empire. Corporations have seized our political system, from the Congress, to the highest court in the land, to the Presidency.

Business has seized our Media through which so it even now controls the paradigm in which we think. Now faced with brink of collapse and youthful and intelligent awakening... they strike our last ability we have left... our right to free-thought. Our fact gathering capabilities have been compromised through ideolog websites and news outlets, as well as direct fire from our congress to our educational systems, teachers, and public unions.

Americans have just begun to get there head out of their iPad and wake up. We're on the brink of collapse. The corporations know it... the politicians know it... but a few of us are still dancing with the stars or wondering what type of shampoo Kim Kardashian uses.”

Collapse caused by the ruling power's greed, and pursuit of profit and dominance through any means... and allowed by the inability of the mass majority of Americans to critically think. The complacent, brainwashed, and sheer ignorant American population has forfeited their ability to reason by allowing their education system to be turned into a how-to-maximize-profit internship from kindergarten to graduate school.

The same people who build 2 billion dollar stealth aircraft to shoot million dollar missiles into a hut that cost two sticks and a stone… Unfortunately, ""these people"" are ourselves. We are at war within our own minds… against each other. 

Take for example if you were to ask 1,000 people if they like to live and breathe. It’s a law of nature that at least one or two of the thousand would say adamantly reject the notion of living and breathing being good. If as those 2 people, I can control the information that flows to the other 998 people, I can through the means of communication convince 35% of the 998 people who are unskilled in critical thought that not living or breathing is in their best interest, and that the other 65% were in some sort of conspiracy against them. I would present not living and breathing as the better argument, because the 65% were in unison, not presenting a fair and balanced position.

OWS IS AN INTELLECTUAL REVOLUTION… and so it has begun. We are direct participants and witnesses to history.

This is an unprecedented look at the fall of an empire. Corporations have seized our political system, from the Congress, to the highest court in the land, to the Presidency.

Now faced with brink of collapse and youthful and intelligent awakening... they strike our last ability we have left... our right to free-thought. Our fact gathering capabilities have been compromised through ideolog websites and news outlets, as well as direct fire from our congress to our educational systems, teachers, and public unions.

Americans have just begun to get there head out of their iPad and wake up. We're on the brink of collapse. The corporations know it... the politicians know it... but a few of us are still dancing with the stars or wondering what type of shampoo Kim Kardashian uses.”

This is a collapse caused by the ruling power's greed, and pursuit of profit and dominance through any means... and allowed by the inability of the mass majority of Americans to critically think. The complacent, brainwashed, and sheer ignorant American population has forfeited their ability to reason by allowing their education system to be turned into a how-to-maximize-profit internship from kindergarten to graduate school.

I have spring and summer to go and then will be transferring to a university in the fall to get my BA in actuarial science. 

I am currently in Calc 1 and statistics, taking Calc 2 in the spring, and possibly Calc 3 in the summer if they offer it.  

I work part-time (25-33 hrs) a week and wanted to find a new job where there might be some actual relevance to my degree but wasn't sure what to look into. I more than likely will not be able to do any sort of internship so I was hoping to do something semi-relevant. So any suggestions?

Also when should I start to try to study for P/1? I was thinking of getting some materials in the spring and starting but I didn't want to waste money if it was too soon and I needed to finish the calc series first. I am just anxious to get started. I really want to have 3 tests done before I graduate the university.

lhhf8,525,2011-10-19,I lived in a Jungle for 7 months in Madagascar. AMA,NAILGUNSODOMY,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/lhhf8/i_lived_in_a_jungle_for_7_months_in_madagascar_ama/,"*FRONT PAGE?! NOT BAD.*

In June 2010 I left the UK to go and live out in the wild reaches of North Madagascar just outside one of the National Parks. I did this to help with a conservation project out there which dealt with a variety of issues, and educated volunteers from all over the world on a number of subjects, such as birding, reptiles, and social issues.

The camp I lived in was extremely basic and I had rice and beans 3 times a day. EVERY day.

If people are interested I can show some photos of my time out there to help understand what it is like living in such a fantastic area with so many climatic problems.

So. Ask away!

**Edit 1** Wow. I am pleased to see so many people are interested in this! To give you a bit of background about myself I did a degree in Zoology and then a Masters in Conservation, followed by working at a conservation organisation.

I am at work at the moment but when I get home later I will try and get some photos uploaded to show everyone. There are some incredible sights to see! Thanks for all the questions, I will endeavour to answer them as soon and best I can : )

**Edit 2** [Here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/harby/sets/72157627609134821/) is a set of selected photos which I took in Madagascar of various things! There aren't many birds, but that is because my camera was dreadful! I do have photos a colleague of mine took but I would need to make sure it is OK to show them first!

By the way, if you are wondering what I looked like at the end of it...this is me with 7+ months beard &amp; hair growth: **[In Madagascar]**(http://www.flickr.com/photos/harby/6257809456/in/set-72157627609134821) |  *[Now]*(http://i.imgur.com/rN8Fh.jpg)

**Edit 3** I've just finished work and am off to the gym but will look at the rest of the comments and get back to you as soon as I can in about 3 hours (8pm GMT) : )

**Edit 4** Back from gym now so am ready to answer more questions!

This is my favorite photo: [Me enjoying a beer in the first lot of rain we had in about 4 months!](http://www.flickr.com/photos/harby/6257647474/in/set-72157627609134821)

**Edit 5**

So a lot of people have been asking similar questions along the line of:

 **""How do I get into this kind of work / conservation?""**

Well if I give you some of my background, I went straight on from my A-Levels to study Biological Sciences specialising in Zoology, then carried on to do a Masters in Conservation and Wildlife Management. I then applied to become an intern at a conservation organisation in the UK (who won't be named), which led to me being there for 7 months working in the Research department. I was then offered through internal recruitment the chance to work over in Madagascar for 7 months.

If anyone is interested in knowing more about my personal history in detail to give you an idea what credentials I have, PM me and I will send you a link to my LinkedIn. I am doing this so as to help aspiring conservation dudes and dudettes to get an idea of what is required.

As I said I was employed through the organisation to do the work out there so I avoided paying the program fees, but typically a project such as this costs around £2000 for 3 months or so I have found, although this can vary. Conservation organisations need volunteers to get fund the projects and do the work so they will always be willing to take people on, just make sure that you have some interest in what is going on and you can afford it!

**""What advice can you give for somebody wanting to do the same thing?""**

This is quite a big thing for a lot of people as it is a lot of money &amp; time, and a real leap out of the comfort zone. What I would recommend is that if you are interested in something like this, look around for gap year companies and see what they have to offer! I know it sounds a bit simple but honestly if you want to do something like this then make the effort to have a look around and even ring these places up to see what they can offer you!

I chose to go with the NGO I did because I had a friend on my Master's course who had done the internship then gone on to one of the projects. I had heard fantastic things and decided to look into it and sure enough the company was right for me. However I know that a few other people who did the same didn't feel it was the right company for them.

Preparation! Make sure if you do it that you commit to it and say ""I'm going to do this in (for example) June 2012!"" and work towards that. Look up all of the information about the country and make sure that you are fully aware of how things over there work and what you need to get a VISA, which can be a nightmare sometimes!

Oh, and one more thing: **MAKE SURE YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO DO IT!** We had a few volunteers who just didn't want to be there at all and it was baffling to the staff why this person didn't want to go out and explore and try to do well over there and contribute! Sure, it is a great thing for the CV, but don't waste your time and other people's time if it is just because of that which you are going over there!"

I currently have Checking and Savings accounts with USAA, and a USAA credit card with $4,500 in debt.  I cut up the old card and didn't activate the new one, so I can only pay it down.  

Right now I'm working as a nanny and getting paid in cash.  The mom in this family is offering me double the pay if I do intern work for her, which of course I will, because it gives me something to do during the day (in a field I'm actually interested in which was my minor in college) and will boost my resume.  But I digress.

I'm paid in all this cash, and I find myself wanting to spend it on dumb material things like clothes and alcohol, when I really need to be paying down my debt and then saving for the future.  As many of you might know, USAA doesn't have physical locations and I can't send cash through the mail to them.  

Therefore, I need a local bank to deposit cash into and then transfer it to my USAA checking in order to pay off my credit card.  Online banking is an essential part of the process.

I'm looking into PNC bank, because they have so many locations all over the country.  I would probably get the free, basic checking account.  Everything seems legit on the website - no monthly fees, no minimum balance, and free transactions at PNC ATM's at Wawa, my favorite convenience store.

My other option would be TD Bank, but they have less locations and I don't know where I'll be in a year.

Does anyone have any horror stories about PNC?  Any hero stories?  Is PNC at risk of going under anytime soon?  Is there anything I'm not thinking of?

Thanks!"
li8kh,10,2011-10-19,"LF graduate advice for a disillusioned biomedical engineer (wall of text, sorry!)",throw_away_bmegrad,biology,https://www.reddit.com/r/biology/comments/li8kh/lf_graduate_advice_for_a_disillusioned_biomedical/,"I was suckered by the pre-professional BME course that showed off cell/tissue research. I ended up taking a broad spectrum of engineering, few relevant ""bio"" courses besides premed stuff.


**TL:DR - BME not what I thought it was. I want wet work with actual cells, tissues.**


My undergrad adviser was always busy, the two professors whose research focuses I thought were cool didn't want me (GPA too low), and my independent research proposition was shot down. GPA was really low for two semesters because my fraternity pledge-son committed suicide unexpectedly and I had a friend since middle-school murdered at the NIU school shooting. Spent summers at non-academic internships. Ended up graduating with a major GPA at 3.02, overall at 3.09. GRE test score of 610 English, 800 Math, 5.5 Writing.


*Overall GPA (Major in parentheses)*

* 2.77 (3.00) - prereqs, premed crap

* 2.55 (2.93) - prereqs, couple pre-major courses, NIU killings

* 2.83 (2.92) - Half major, half electives, pledge-son death

* 3.45 (3.42) - Mostly all subspecialty (cell/tissue eng) classes


**TL:DR - Had bad grades early on, didn't get research exp.**


I couldn't take a gap year off (obscure rule), couldn't swap majors without taking an extra year, and it was hard to see cell/tissue classes until senior year.  The capstone courses were quantitative physiology (math class), tissue eng (device/math class), biothermo (physics class), biofluids (nonstop Nav-Stokes math), and Senior Design (device class). Rigid class scheduling meant I couldn't take Biology wet lab courses (Proteomics, Genetics). My low grades meant I couldn't transfer to the liberal arts school for a Biology degree, so I stayed in engineering, manned up, and finished what I started.


**TL:DR - Constricted by rules, lack of cell/tissue wet work, lost hope in college.**


I graduated in Spring 2010. I have worked odd jobs unrelated to health fields (graphic design, painting, tutoring), but I'm not going anywhere with it and life feels so damn meaningless--it's more like I've been unemployed for a year. I tried to get jobs in finance (was 1 class short of Econ minor), consulting, research tech, but I just never could get an offer. I feel like I wasted my undergraduate years. I'm taking online courses in parallel and distributed programming (Python/Java) nowadays while unemployed, and it's kicking my ass but a nice refrain from unemployment woes and being rejected from jobs.


**TL:DR - Jobless, life sputtering, taking programming courses at the moment.**


Do I even start my PhD/Master's search, when I didn't have strong major grades (@Ivy school, so grade inflation) and no undergrad research? Am I even ready for it? I don't even think any professors remember me, or will just look at my grades and say, ""he sucked."" I'm asking Reddit because I hate, distrust, and felt betrayed by school's administration, career center, and BME department. I really don't know, so much of the bio/health fields look interesting to me but I'm worried I'm just going to be disillusioned a few years into another degree program. I mean...I can't even find a shit lab tech job to get some exp. I love learning about how organic systems work, but I just don't know...


The independent research that got rejected was looking at was cell/tissue transplant rejection, specifically looking at parasitic male anglerfish's tissue fusion (and subsequent tissue atrophy) to females. It got rejected because no professors seemed to be working on anything similar. The research could benefit knowledge of angiogenesis, chimeras, histology, somatostatin &amp; growth hormones, tissue/organ rejection, tissue atrophy, etc. How would I go about finding a graduate program that would support this research? Or should I just stay away from bio altogether? Unemployment is driving me insane!


**TL:DR - How do I figure out what to go into? Should I? How do I know which PIs won't suck?**"

lk1fu,0,2011-10-21,"Watched ""Sucker Punch"" last night and I'm disappointed I didn't like it more (SPOILERS INCLUDED)",sumguythere,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/lk1fu/watched_sucker_punch_last_night_and_im/,"Tried to keep this as spoiler free as I could, but just in case you haven't seen the movie, be warned. 

Last night I took the time to watch ""Sucker Punch"" which I missed in theaters but thought would be just my kind of film. I enjoy movies of the mind, those that explore psychological ideas through a flowing, dreamlike medium. And the kick ass fight scenes and sexy damn girls certainly didn't hurt. I just don't know if they helped.

The story follows a girl we know only as Babygirl, an orphan after her mother and sister die and put into an asylum by her step father. Implied to be the bad guy in a movie with a less then defined antagonist, he drops her in a metal asylum where he sets the events in motion that will lead to a lobotomy to remove her troublesome side. The story becomes her escape from the hospital before the procedure, but where her world becomes less and less clear as she slips into a world of burlesque theater to cope with the world she's been thrust into. There she meets Sweet Pea and Rocket, sisters brought in by Blue, the club's owner, and where she is made to practice dance so she can perform for the High Roller, a manifestation of the procedure.

Accented with fantastic battle and fight sequences against truly imaginative enemies, the world Babygirl creates is vibrant and exciting compared to the asylum she finds herself in. To cope with the forced dance performances she's made to do by the club's owner (also a medical intern Babygirl meets on the way in), and the house mistress (who is also the head doctor at the asylum) Babygirl escapes to these elaborate battlefields where she, sweet pea and others are sent on imaginative enemies by a wise older man (who is never identified) to achieve their mission. These missions tie in to the real world escape, and their success or failure translates from trench battles against reanimated Germans and against terrorist robots gives them the tools and weapons they need to escape before ""The High Roller"" arrives. 

I wish I knew what bothered me about the movie. I love imaginative action flicks like Sucker Punch, enjoyed the visuals and the effects. The music and the disconnected flow of the story reminded me of Heavy Metal and I found myself disappointed that Sucker Punch lacked that edge. The scantily clad women in the burlesque presented such a wonderful chance to titillate the audience more, to make the scummy world that these ladies exist in all the more bleek, especially compared to the spirit, their determination to escape. I found myself thinking about Heavy metal several times while watching Sucker Punch and saw many of the same themes; hard rock music, an epic feel, sexy, strong women and corrupt, dark men, and unworldly enemies that could only come from the fantasy mind of a child abandoned and left on their own.

The fight scenes were well done and not actually over the top. While the girls appear almost superhuman it's in such a way that you believe it, especially since so much of the movie, we must assume, takes place in Babygirl's mind where she seems to learn she is in control. But the fights are not bloody or especially violent, especially against the non-human enemies Babygirl finds herself facing. Especially compared to the darkness in the doctors and staff at the asylum she seems to prefer fighting these imaginary monster, developing a natural grace that all fighting girls seem to get in these movies that she doesn't have in the burlesque world.

The story is creative and smart, doing a very good job taking the young girl from her parents death and into the transformation into Babygirl, the hardened fighter ready to sacrifice herself for family or friends. The characters develop throughout the story instead of just acting sexy or fighting, and we see distinct personalities in characters that easily could be 2 dimensional. 

I liked the girls, I liked the fights, I believed the world enough. The music is fantastic and the directors use of it as a way to bridge the worlds was well done (though raises some questions). But something about the movie bothers me, though I can't quite put my finger on what that thing is. The movie was thorough in that each angle was wrapped up in the end, in that there are no really big loose ends or plot holes the director glosses over; it returns to the point it started from.

There was a certain marketing formula is feels like the producers tried to follow in an effort to make the movie successful; pretty girls, cool cgi, just enough mind bending and distorted perspective to give them some creative liberties but not enough to be thoughtful. Perhaps it is one of the flaws in that this was made as a movie; with more time the characters could develop more, the world could be explore further. I feel the producers and director took a story that had a lot of potential to be edgy, sexy, that could rock the hell out and leave the audience blown away. Instead we're left with an pretty, action flick where, even the main character admits, is difficult to tell who's story it is. 

2.5 out of 4 stars, and while I'll be fondly thinking of Babygirl I don't think I'll be adding this to my DVD collection, just stream it from netflix.

TL:DR I watched Sucker Punch last night and while I loved the girls, the music, the fights, and just about everything there is something about the movie keeping me from loving it and it bothers me."

At the end, Morris is giving his speech accepting the endorsement, Steven's about to do an interview, blah blah blah, but in the middle of all that, this chick walks in with coffee and asks for a cell phone. She's there to replace Molly.

Here are the two possibilities as I see it:

1. This demonstrates the cyclical nature of politics and how easy it is to replace people.

2. Molly's death was a set-up to either insure the affair didn't leak or to prompt Steven to use the information for his political purposes (and therefore make Morris trade a cabinet seat for a endorsement).

Now, I'm leaning towards #2, though I do acknowledge it has some flaws (like how unpredictable Steven's response would be), but the new intern looks a lot like Molly...although I did stay for the end of the credits and Molly and Jill are cast to two different actresses.

Bonus: a really talkative old woman has the same theory (we came up with it independently).

TL;DR Did Molly die or was it staged?"

Are second round interviews similar to first round interviews in the sense that they're looking to pick one or two of the best candidiates from a pool of applicants?

During the alleged 1 on 1 lunch with an associate, is it best to keep the conversation professional? Or is it intended that I carry out a casual conversation (within professional means, of course)? Talk to him/her about travel, tv, family, that sort of thing.

What is the mindset of the firm at this stage? Have they already developed a gauge of my professional and academic abilities, and now they're just really looking to see if they can work with my personality?

Percentage rate of people who get second round interviews that get offered positions? Keep in mind, this is an internship I'm going for.

Also, what is the general waiting period between the 2nd round interview and the firm's decision? I feel really confident about a 1st round interview with another of the Big 4, so is it the sort of thing where I'll have to decide immediately before I even get to weigh my options?

I looked up and watched as she strutted into her office...thinking to myself how good she looked for a woman her age. She was about 40, having climbed to a high position in the office in no time, and was very intimidating because of her dedication and how serious she took her work. Her name was Mrs. Duncan. I was new to the office, a young intern just trying to move up in the company, doing whatever I could.

I heard her call her receptionist and ask her to bring me to her office, as she needed to discuss my future with the company.

I followed the receptionist slowly and nervously...walking in and kind of standing awkwardly in her door...""Yes Mrs. Duncan?""

""Take a seat,"" she said as she walked around and closed the blinds, saying to her receptionist, ""Please make sure this meeting is not disturbed,"" and locked the door.

I got a bit red...the idea of a meeting not being disturbed seemed daunting to me considering my small importance to the company...I sat down and waited for what she had to say.

She sat behind her desk and started flicking through some papers. ""So Dustin, how long have you been working here?"" She spoke firmly.

""Well, just a couple of months for my internship ma'am,"" I replied respectfully.

""How do you think it's been going?"" she asked.

""I like it a lot...I feel that I mesh well with everyone in the office."" I was getting a bit more comfortable

""Well that's good then, do you feel comfortable?"" she asked.

""Yes ma'am, I like it here, great environment."" I was slightly leaning back in my seat, easing up.

""Would you like to stay here? And maybe...move up in the company?"" she said.

I smiled. ""Of course I would! I have been waiting so long for an opportunity like this.""

""Well there's an opening at the moment, to be my personal assistant advisor...but to get the job, you will need to do something a little out of the ordinary,"" she implied…

My smile shortened as I wondered what she might have I mind. “Okay, I'll do whatever it takes ma’am; I would love to have the job...

She undid a few of the top buttons on her blouse, showing the cleavage of her luscious breasts

My eyes widened...I sit back a bit more...wondering what the hell is going on...I could feel the heat overcoming my body just by the sight of her plump breasts.

""What do you say?"" she smirked slightly.

I blushed. ""Well, like I said...I need this job...just let me know what I have to do Mrs. Duncan...""

""I think you know."" Her smirk was now a very sexy smile…

I smirked slightly. ""Mrs. Duncan, this is kind of...unprofessional...why the extra favor?""

""It's not so much a favor, more like...an unwritten job description."" She continued to seduce me.

“Well, I want this job more than anything..."" I led on, my thick cock throbbing in my pants already. ""Just let me know what needs to be done Mrs. Duncan..."" I stood up and walked around to her side of the desk.

""How about you show me what needs to be done."" She was leaning back in her chair.

I stood there, my large bulge right in front of her...I smirked again...""I hope the glass to your office is soundproof Mrs. Duncan.""

""Practically,"" she grinned

I bent down, gently kissing her neck...one hand caressing her inner thigh, the other working on unbuttoning the rest of her blouse.

She rested a hand on my back and leaned my head to the side, moaning softly

I found my way to her lips, kissing them...my tongue pressed against hers... I stood her up and sat her on the edge of her desk. Sliding her blouse off, reaching around and undoing her bra, letting it fall to the floor.

""Mmm,” she hummed. “You are a good worker.""

I smiled, whispering, ""I learn fast..."" I took her hand and placing it over my throbbing cock, kissing on her chest now, taking her nipple into my mouth, sucking-nibbling gently.

She rubbed my cock through my pants. ""You like my tits baby?"" she asked.

""They are perfect...like I said, I love the working environment here..."" I replied, slowly running the tip of my wet tongue around her nipple in slow, small circles.

""Hopefully the environment will get more... more interesting,"" she whispered.

""Hopefully..."" I felt my pants drop to the ground, her hands sliding my boxers down. I hiked her skirt up as she sat spread on the desk.

She wrapped her hand around my cock and rubbed it slowly. ""Seems I made a good choice,"" she moaned.

I kissed her softly... my hands sliding her panties down, off her ankles. ""I am beginning to like this company more and more.”

She kissed my lips gently. ""Me and you both,"" she whispered to me.

I traced the tip of my cock along her inner thighs...slowly pressing it into her tight, wet pussy, inching all 8 1/2'' in, kissing her passionately.

She gripped onto my back and kissed me back, letting her tongue run freely in my mouth 

""Mmm baby that feels good,"" she moaned.

I pumped slowly in at first; slowly rocking into the desk harder, faster... my thick cock deeply penetrating her soaking wet pussy... I began to breathe harder and faster.

""Mmmm that's right, fuck me like that baby, and let your big thick cock fill me up."" She started to slowly rock her hips into the rhythm of my rocking.

I picked up the pace; eventually pounding into her tight pussy, tearing into it with my thick, throbbing cock. ""You couldn't ask for a better job interview than this Mrs. Duncan,"" I groaned.

""Mmm, I'd glad I came up with the idea."" She started to play with her tits, rubbing them, circling around her nipples and pinching them slightly.

I railed into her as hard as I could, our skin slapping together. She was moaning louder. I put my face in her tits, my body tensing up, my thick cock ready to explode.

Her body quivered, she grabbed on to me tight and tightened her pussy as she began to grind her pussy onto my cock. ""Mmm yes baby, yessss!"" She was moaning at the top of her lungs.

I pounded into her once more...leaning in, whispering. ""Bend over baby, let me give it to you the right way.""

She turned around and leaned over the table. ""You want to fuck my ass?""

I smirked. ""No, I want to pound that tight little pussy from behind, and then you can take my load however you want... whatever the job requires."" I was horny as hell.

""Okay.” She spread her legs and bent over further. ""I wouldn't mind if you wanted to though,"" she said in a cheeky voice.

I grinned to myself, spanking her sexy ass before shoving my cock into her pussy again, rocking hard into her ass, ready to give her a nice little treat.

""Ohh yes, fuck me like an office whore!"" She moaned louder, her pussy getting wetter.

I absolutely tore into her pussy, my balls hitting against her, her ass getting a bit red...I let out a loud groan, ready to fucking explode. I pulled out quickly, spit on her ass, and slid my cock into her, pumping a few times. Letting go, my big, hot load spewing into her ass, oozing out as I continued to slide smoothly in and out of her tight asshole.

""Oh yessss baby, yess!"" She started to squirm as her pussy spasmed and she began to cum, all the juices running out of her pussy ""Mmm,"" she softly let out.

I slowly collapsed over her, breathing very hard...the hardest work I had ever done in an office...

""Well, I hope I got the job Mrs. Duncan,"" I said, out of breath.

""Oh, you certainly did."" She began to buckle up my pants, purring as the tips of her fingers traced along my cock one last time…for now."

lodja,4,2011-10-25,[REQUEST] Access db help (modifications).,ParanoydAndroid,Favors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/lodja/request_access_db_help_modifications/,"reddit, I’m in trouble.  I won’t bore you with the details, but the essentials are that I’m a student intern who is the office “IT guy”.  I had some luck modifying a simple Access (2007) database at work, and that got me tagged as a database guy too.  I’ve been assigned a project to modify another database, and in short I screwed up bad; I let the project slip and now the deadline is upon me and I have absolutely no idea how to do the things I need to do.  The project is extremely simple, I no longer have the time to try to muddle through the Access for dummies books I have lying around my desk.

The modifications are simple, but I have trouble with something as simple as getting bound controls to work properly on a form, so I’m so far over my head I’m drowning.  Here’s what I need:

1.	 The db has 4 tables, 1 “real” table and 3 lookup tables (1 field, ~5 records).  I need to swap them out for Sharepoint lists that will contain the same data.
2.	The db has ~20 queries that are literally as simple as they could possibly be (eg., “select * where data &lt; today”).  I need the queries modified to refer to the new tables as opposed to the old.
3.	One new query needs to be added.
4.	Due cosmetic changes on the forms that are essentially a grid of buttons used to access the queries and reports.

All of the operations seem pretty easy, but I’m having trouble unraveling what button references which query (especially the delete query—I can’t figure out the button macro syntax, and it’s like 2 lines long :/).  I also have trouble with all the various properties options for every button on the form, and how various references work.  It just seems like I look up one piece of information in a book which references 5 other things I don't know about, which I in turn have to check up on, which leads to 15 other entries for how to do what I need to do, _ad nauseum_.

I’m so far over my head and I think that for anyone even remotely experienced with Access, the changes shouldn’t take more than an hour, and certainly wouldn’t take more than 3 but I’ve been banging my head on the wall for 10.  

Since I’m pretty sure it wouldn’t take someone good at this sort of thing more than an hour, I believe it’s still reasonable r/favors territory, and I’m also willing to return any favor I can.  I’m not much of a db guy, but I _am_ an IT/networking guy (A+, Security+, CCNA) and have built countless computers, so I can help anyone with those areas, though I know that on reddit such skills are not exactly in short supply.  Either way, I’ll trade any favor it’s in my power to do.  Help me reddit, you’re my only hope.  :(

PM me if you can help, and I can send a copy of the db over.

Thank you!"

My car broke down, my computer died, I accidentally spilled soda all over my room, I have homework and internship assignments that are overdue, and I capped it all off with a brief moment of girlfriend drama. 

So when I finally got some down time, I reached for some wine, then some beer and next thing I know I'm surfing the devil site. Cut to the next morning and I get an e-mail telling me I won a box of Devil's Weed Churchills. Let it be known that alcohol and the devil's site don't mix!

Anyway, I have no idea whether these cigars are any good, but I'm pretty sure I don't want to smoke 20 of them. I also don't want to just give away potentially crappy sticks to unsuspecting people. So it's contest time! 

The person with the most hilarious/horrible/brutal drunk/morning after story as determined by upvotes, will get a handful of Devil's Weed sticks along with whatever else I decide to throw into the package. What's one more bad decision right? :P  

Secondly, the person with the most responsible/ avoided the dangers of excess drinking story will get a handful of sticks too, because frankly, you need to share in some bad decision making for once :P

**Rules:** 

* Contest will run 1 week until next Wednesday. 
* One story per post, this will allow people to up-vote 
* Can enter as many times as you want, but you can only win one prize
* In case of a tie, I'll choose a winner
* You assume all risks for how bad these cigars will taste


Good luck! (I think)

- My first every girlfriend (2.5years) &amp; I broke up
- My friendship with my best friend has fallen apart (so that they won't talk to me)
- Gotten to the point where I've realised that my other best friend doesn't value our friendship nearly as much as I do. (As in I thought we were best friends, seems that I'm only his distraction from his family when he visits home for a couple days)

I feel that I've lost my friends and my entire support group. Due to bullying and other things I didn't really have friends before college, and I struggle to make friends (socially awkward penguin). I get along fine with people in my year, but it's more of a working relationship than a true friendship. I really value and seek out close friendships, but few seem to actually be interested in that. 

I went through a funk in the summer, between the end of my internship and the start of college, which I never really got out of.

I do my usual each day; lectures, assignments etc etc, and I'm as motivated to do college work as I ever was. But I've entirely lost my exercise &amp; health drive. I used to be quite healthy but in the past year I've just been eating worse and worse and not exercising.  But whats worse is that I've stopped caring about it. I used to suffer from bulimia and poor body issues (16-&gt;19) but I managed to mostly get over that. These days I'm just eating a lot without exercise.

I've never been suicidal and always keep a positive outlook on life (people are good, love everybody and other such things). However I've noticed lately that more quick to anger, and have a complete lack of energy/willpower to do anything besides my college work and playing games. And even then there's been days where everything is either too much effort, or too boring.

Thanks for listening anyway. Any suggestions would be most welcome :)"

lrgqx,5,2011-10-27,I need a little help.,letmebegin,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/lrgqx/i_need_a_little_help/,"letmebegin; starting in April of this year I have had several life changing events occur; culminating with the death of my mother on October 4th.  

Some of my best friends moved away in April, I am happy for them but sad in the same respect, they moved 3000 miles away so visits and all around being with them would be different.  

In May a friend of mine (from the same WoW guild which we had known each other for about a year) and I started talking and decided we should meet. She visited me the weekend of 4th of July and we hit it off, I had the best four days of my life!! She left to return home on the 4th of July (which was a monday) she told me she like me and had so much fun that she was going to for go the rest of her internship this summer and return to be with me for 6 weeks before she had to go back to school. 

I get a call at work from one of my mom's close friends on Tuesday the 5th of July that my mother has been admitted to the hospital with respitory problems.  I go and visit, talk with her, her breathing is labored and her Oxygen Saturation level is in the low 80s (we walk around typically around 90-95%). Little did I know that this was a hospital visit my mother was not to recover from.

My friend (by now safe to say my Girlfriend) returned to be with me for the rest of summer. We had a great time, even with this looming problem of my mother in  the hospital.  She helped me sort things out, go through her finances, figure out what bills needed attention, helped me with Power of Attorney. She basically is a Saint.

July leads way to August, there are some advances and set backs with my mother, she takes two steps forward, able to get off the ventilator, then setbacks with weakness. O2 Sats plummet to 50 she has to be sedated and intubated again.

3rd week in August my Girlfriend has to leave to head back for school, we make plans to meet up. I would be the first to visit, I went to see her in Boston (flying from Alaska) the last week in september. She would then come up the weekend of the 28th of Oct. and stay for the week. 

Things got dicey with mom in late august, we had problems with the hosptial she was staying at. Got her moved to a new facility but she had a bleed in her lungs and had to return to the original facility. 

So while all this is going on I find out that my Mom's Mother (my Grandma) has to have a surgery for a growth in her abdomen. She is 80 some odd years old I think maybe 87.  Between my Aunt and My brother we decide it best to not tell my mom that this is going on. 

Middle of Sept. now I get a call from my Father that is Dad had passed away, allthough somewhat unexpected he was 92 and had lived a very full life. I elect not to attend the funeral (which was in oregon) being that I wanted to stay nearby incase anything happened to my mother. (My parents being divorced since 1995 my father decieds to do the same)

We get through the stressors of that weekend service, some family members offer to ""stream"" the service we decided not to go through with that. We visit mom at the hospital, go out and have dinner have a few drinks. The weekend was tough but we made it through.

Next week is the week before I leave to go visit my GF, I get a call from a good friends mother here in town asking if I had seen him. (he lives at home with his parents) I told her I had not seen him, and I dig a bit more to find out why she is asking. Turns out he has had a mental break and has gone ""missing"" Me and a couple of other buddies search the city for him unable to locate him we let the parents handle the missing persons report and all that. He gave us all a scare but he called me two days later just talking to me like everything was normal, as soon as I hung up I called his mother let him know that he was ""ok"" and he actually called her about an hour later and came home (he was gone for two weeks, off medication and we as friends feared the worse.) 

Now the last week in sept. I go to visit my GF in Boston have a great time we duck down to NYC for a day, have some great meals, laugh at the Red Sox's implosion and missing the postseason. We take pictures we laugh we love, it felt great for me to be removed from all the stress at home.  

Thursday of the week I am gone we are out to dinner or drinks with some friends and I get several calls that I ignore on my phone finally when the 8th call comes in I answer it, it is a surgeon that tells me he needs to operate on my mother to fix a problem with necropsy around a feeding tube wound. (remove dead tissue around a wound that is not healing correctly) I talk to him about the risks and the benifit of ths operation. Discuss it with the family and we decide that it is time to go ahead with the operation.

I fly back home on Sunday arriving early monday moring (like 2am) having to go to work at 7am I am pretty beat. I make it through the day but I had contracted a pretty bad head cold in the process, my mother being prone to infection I decide not to visit for fear of complicating matters.

Dinner on monday night back at the house, Dad is cooking fish, my brother is over and I am showing pictures telling of my exploits in the ""big cities"" we get a call from the doctor around 9:30 telling us that the situation with my mother is grim. We all head down sit around the bed and tell stories, she is tired and in pain, we ask her if she wants us to go so she can rest, she nodded, we said our goodbyes and left for the evening. The doctor assures us that he will work with her the best he can to stabalize her blood pressure and get her through the night. 

I get a call at 5am basically telling me that she is going to die and if we wanted to come down we should do so quickly. We make it down there get all situatied and they start turning off the machines. The give her the (in my terms ""metric fuck ton"") of morphine and after about an hour she had passed. 

I got a call from my GF and she had heard from a close family friend, she booked a ticket and was there that night at 1am. My GF is a saint, she was there for me and continues to be. 

So I guess you could say that this year has been crazy and that it is logical for me to have some depression.

Let's add one more thing to the pile, we schedule the funeral for the 16th of Oct. I take the friday beforehand off to pick up family at the airport and do some general milling and fussing around before the event. Thursday late at work (I get done at 4pm) around 3:30pm I get an e-mail from a friend I used to work with, it is basically a sucide note.  I start to freak out, not sure what to do, he is down in Georgia and I call the police telling them that I have a credible suicide threat from someone and they try to dispatch a unit but are unable to interviene prior to him dispatching himself. I don't find out about it until about an hour before I have to go in to public and mourn the loss of my mother (the funeral) 

I have been pretty stoic through all of this, I went to go see a psycholoigist on Tuesday. Since then I have felt very depressed, just sad and not motivated to do anything, it is like a roller coaster sometimes, like right now typing all this out I feel ok, I fear that when I hit submit the reality of it will sink back in again.

I try and do the things that I like to do it brings some temporary relief. I find myself crying for no reason, I get mad and misplace my anger at customers on the phone or on chat sessions (and no I do not work for Origin or EA..lol /r/gaming) 

I know that it will work out and I know that I will be ok, but I just feel so sad and I don't know what to do. I have paperwork in place at work for FMLA for myself so I am not going to lose my job. Work has been very understanding and supportive through this whole ordeal.

I sometimes think about what it would be like not to breathe anymore, but I pretty much put that aside because I know I have soooooooooooo^100 much to live for.  I just feel really sad and wonder what I should do, I see my psychologist again on tuesday and I will tell him how I feel after our first session. 

Anyone able to offer any advice or supportive things I can do inbetween sessions to not get overwhelmed?

tl;dr - Good friends leave town; meet the love of my life (5k miles away); mom gets sick; grandma gets sick; Grandpa dies; friend gos on a paranoid schizophrenic break (we feared suicide); mom dies; other close friend commits suicide; I AM SAD!  

sorry for the spelling and grammar errors. once I started typing I didn't want to stop.

lrg2e,0,2011-10-27,My insurance company is looking to hire a few more agents if you're interested. xpost from r/utah,onewatt,SaltLakeCity,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaltLakeCity/comments/lrg2e/my_insurance_company_is_looking_to_hire_a_few/,"The insurance company I work for is looking to hire several new agents over the next few months throughout Utah.  Apparently the lack of hurricanes, tornadoes, and major earthquakes makes this a nice place to insure people...

What I think we're looking for: somebody who is willing to work hard on their own (without supervision) and build an insurance agency for themselves over the next 4 years or so, then sticking around long-term to accumulate wealth. You need to be a college graduate for the full-time position, but internships may be available for those still in school. 

The job involves finding and meeting people and seeing if your insurance can help them out.  Since we're required to have auto and home in most cases it's not difficult to get people to at least get a quote from you. 

They pay is commission based, and you can basically expect about 7 dollars per month per 'unit' of insurance you sell.  Example: if you meet a family with 3 cars and 1 home, that's 4 'units' of insurance. So as long as they stay with you you'll earn about 28 dollars per month. So if you gain, say, 20 units per month every month your income increases by about 140 dollars every month. Add life, health, and other insurance products to the mix and it adds up pretty quick.

Starting out you can get help from the company to pay the bills.  So if, for example, you consistently sell 20 units of insurance and a couple of life insurance products each month you can expect a couple thousand dollars of help from the company until your own 'book of business' is large enough to support you.

The interview process will involve 2 or 3 interviews plus at least one personality test. You can not be hired if you have ever been bankrupt or worked as an independent insurance agent.

Anyway, PM me if you're interested.  I'll need at least your email and name so I can send you the personality test link. I'll send you my contact info."

I'm a college senior from Rochester, NY and I just landed my dream internship in Lakewood for this winter. I did some reddit searching but couldn't quite find the info I'm looking for. Having only visited the area a couple times, I have some questions for you guys:

1) What's the cheapest area I could find temporary housing in or near Lakewood? I only need a place for 3 months so I will probably end up checking craigslist, but I'm curious as to what the different neighborhoods are like.

2) How is the public transportation around Denver? I'm not bringing my car so I'll be taking the bus or biking (depending on proximity) to work. The bus system here in Rochester is not very good so I'm a little nervous.

Thanks in advance! I loved the time I was able to spend in Colorado and I'm definitely moving somewhere near Boulder or Denver once I graduate."

My girlfriend and I have been going out for nearly 2 years now.  We've had our ups and ours downs but she's a great girl with a good heart and has been there for me when not crippled by anxiety and depression.

We recently moved in together, which adds even more commitment to this relationship.  Being around her all day, however, has made me realized how hopelessly anxious and depressed she really is.  I had known that she was like this before moving in with her but recently I've been worried about our future if she can't get over this.

For as long as I've known her she's always been stressed out about, what I perceive as, petty life issues.  Not liking her job, not liking an internship, not liking school.  Right now she's attending grad school and already wants to find a job and drop out, with the first semester not even over.  I feel like she is unable to commit to anything and always feels as if the grass will be greener on the other side, which it never is.

This has caused a great deal of emotional strain, which I try to hide but she knows her anxiety and depression are putting on me.  I have been living on my own for nearly 2 years now, my parents being a few states away.  I've managed to graduate University, get a decent paying full time job and become fully independent, all on my own.  I never bitched and never asked anything from anybody.  I feel like part of her problem is she's had it too good, she has rich parents who have paid for everything and never let her fall on her ass or realize how brutal the real world can be when it comes to just surviving.

I love her but I feel like I need a partner, not a little girl to take care of.  It often feels like that, coming home from a long stressful day at work and having her unload all of her insecurities and anxieties onto me.  It's more than i can handle.  I'm a young mid 20s man and have so many of my own life issues that I don't even start talking about because I'm so exhausted after dealing with hers.  It's even lead to me feeling unloved an unappreciated by her.  I spend my money, my time, my life with her and feel I get so little in return.  I've never seen her be mean to anyone or say anything cold hearted but I feel she's getting more out of this relationship than I am.

I have suffered through anxiety and depression in my adolescence and now feel like it has come full circle.  I feel awful putting my parents through what I did.  I've realized now that as hard as anxiety and depression can be, sometimes the ones hardest affected are those who love that person who just can't stand seeing them not get any better.

I really don't know what to do, I'm in too deep and can't get out of this relationship, nor do I really think I want to.  I feel like I would hurt her feelings if I told her how neglected I feel but I need to look after myself as well.  I was such a happy, care free person before I met her and now I look forward to being at work so I don't have to deal with her endless complaining and self-pity.

I feel like an asshole but this is how I feel, i don't know what to do reddit.

Thank you"

We have been together 6 months, living together for four.

At first it was great because I had my intership and he has his buisness. Then my internship ended and I was stuck at home all day looking for jobs. Everything was still great between us though. Then he got me a job at his place(my desk is 20 feet from his office). It was fun at first, but now that its been a little over a month, we get into tiff's every day. It's 75% my fault. I am so stubborn. When something bothers me, I just want to be left alone and I don't want to talk about it. He is opposite. He likes to ask over and over ""What is wrong?"" And I get upset over silly things that I later learn was such a waste of time to get upset about. 

We are really good for eachother but I feel that this 24/7 thing is putting a damper on our relationship. I love the job and he loves having me there so I don't want to quit. 

I don't know what to do, I dont want this to ruin us. We are so happy together when we aren't bickering. 

I told him ""I miss missing you"" and he doesn't understand.

Advice? Anyway to help my stubbornness?

I just entered law school, and it's like a whole other world in here.  I kind of skated by in undergrad, going to class but not really taking notes all the time, showing up but not 100% there.  I graduated Cum Laude and made it into law school, and then reality hit me like a ton of bricks.

One of the biggest aspects that's causing a bit of contention right now is my lack of a laptop or other not taking device in class.  I always thought a pen and paper was the best way to go, but people are starting to stare at me because I don't have some kind of laptop sitting on my desk.

That being said, I'm a law student, so I have less money then most of the people I'll one day be representing.  I'm living meal to meal at this point, trying to find a internship while taking a full course load, so I come to you, Reddit, looking for help.

If anyone has an old laptop/netbook lying around, collecting dust, or you've just upgraded, and you'd be willing to help out a guy who's trying to help out those less fortunate in the future, I would be extremely grateful."

Let's call her Ann. It was during our freshman and sophomore years in college, and we lived together for the two years. We broke up close to new years, and we've only spoken two or three times since... the most recent time being over 4 months ago. She doesn't go to my university any more, and she's moved to another state. At the beginning of this year, she had the same internship that I have now, so I'm meeting a lot of people that knew her. I decided to relax in the jacuzzi behind the condos that I'm staying at... that she stayed at.....
There was a group of people in the jacuzzi when I got there, one man and three women, all middle aged. They were drinking, and snapping each others bras and bikini bottoms... The guy kept making comments like ""Why don't you join us? I don't think I can satisfy *ALL* of them...""
I thought, ""Ok, they're swingers. That's cool""
Then one of the women said, ""So you work at [enter the name of my company here]""
I was surprised and said, ""Why, yes, how did you know?""
She said, ""Everyone that works there stays in these condos. Did you know Ann?""
I sat up. I said, ""You knew Ann? How was she?""
The man spoke up and said, ""Yeah we knew her, she partied with us all the time! She was cool, she blah blah blah blah...""

I was so scared at the thought that... that maybe she and this fat, hairy middle aged guy.....

I got out of the jacuzzi and went back to my apartment. I sent Ann a text message an hour ago. I don't think she's texting back.

Sweet Meat... I know you're out there somewhere. I still love you so much. 

Please reddit. I've slept with more women than I can count. I've won the hearts of more women than I have fingers. Success and affection means nothing to me. I can't even remember the last time I was happy. How do I get over her? How do I find happiness again?"

He told me that we weren’t good for each other and kicked me out of his apartment to go deal with my tears by myself.  

He was never good at handling tears.  He thought they were manipulative, instead of what they actually always were, a sign of sadness.

A year ago, I mourned the loss of a relationship.  It didn’t take me long however, to realize that I was mourning the sudden onslaught of change.  It wasn’t the relationship that I would miss, it was the fear of change.  It was the fear of change that kept me in an emotionally abusive relationship for over two years.  I told myself I would never be one of those girls, who stuck up for the boyfriend that put her down in front of her friends, who pressured her to drink when she didn’t want to, who I fought with, more often than I didn’t.  I never thought I’d be one of those girls.  

But I was, and I was miserable.  And irony of all ironies was that he was the one who dumped me.  And it was the nicest thing he ever did for me.  It only took me a few days to stop crying, and a few weeks to stop caring, and three months to find someone new.  

Two years of being put down, and shit on, and told that the clothes I wore weren’t what he liked, and why didn’t I invite him to a mall trip that was supposed to just be me and girls, and why didn’t I tell him that I got out of class early.  “What’s going on with you and that guy?”  Don’t leave a toothbrush here, you’re smothering me.  

I questioned all of my actions, I was careful with how I worded things, I babied him through our relationship when we were supposed to be partners.  

I’m happy now.  I’m dating the most wonderful human being I’ve ever met.  I’m double majoring, I have an internship at a newspaper, and even from 400+ miles away, my current SO is attentive and caring and wonderful.  

I am stronger now.  I stick up for myself now.  It took two years of crap, to make me see that I deserve better, and to get to the road I’m on now.

Don’t take any less than what you deserve.  If you’re ever anywhere and you think to yourself, “I may not like what’s going on here, but I don’t want to be a wet blanket”, then leave.  Don’t surround yourself with people whose goals and morals don’t match yours.  Don’t tell yourself that he’s trying harder when he’s clearly not.  

Be strong, but be strong for yourself.  Be smart, because it’ll help you later.  And once you’re happy with yourself, you’ll attract the right kind of person.  And you can be real partners.  And your happiness will be your own.

TLDR: One year out of a shitty relationship, and I'm feeling really positive.

Edit: What I'm hoping people don't take away from this is that I think people need to jump into a new relationship immediately after a bad one.  I just stumbled onto something great.  I'm mostly just hoping other women who might be able to relate will read this and feel good.

lsbng,12,2011-10-28,Am I being selfish by wanting to take this opportunity?,shouldigoawayorstay,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/lsbng/am_i_being_selfish_by_wanting_to_take_this/,"Ok, Reddit, so here goes. 

Me: 25 Her: 23. Length of relationship: 4 months.

Some background: Me: IT guy with no college degree pulling down 50k/year at a small IT company in Seattle. 

Her: College degree, odd jobs so far (nanny, soccer coach, etc) and trust fund with about 400k and growing (interest, stocks).

So recently I have an opportunity of a lifetime to go overseas to the U.A.E. and be making about 85k/year for a one year contract to start. I would have to spend a chunk of time about 1 or 2 months there but after that would be able  to fly back to the USA periodically. So here's the problem: She absolutely is not willing to budge on me going over there for a year.

We argued about this last night. I don't have a college degree and helpdesk experience doesn't do much in the way of dollars. She's saying it's ""unfair"" that we've only been together a few months and I would be leaving so soon. I reminded her for a guy like me, this is a rare opportunity. She thinks I can score jobs that pay more here. Experience tells me that's not exactly true and certainly not easy. I told her about my friend (who is getting me the job) and his wife and how they're making it work but she came back with (to be fair) the fact that they've been married for 10 years and have something established that's not just 4 months old. Even though the Middle East is un-appealing in some respects, the benefits to myself, my resume, my career, and my pay are very VERY VERY difficult to ignore. I'm willing to work with a long distance situation. She says she couldn't deal without seeing me for even just a month. I further explained that I can fly out to the US and I can fly her into the UAE. No dice. I explained she has the money to do it (and to be honest, I would have the money to do it FOR her even). Still no dice. 

So it's a crossroads type of situation. She is unwilling to even try to work with this and freaked out and was crying the whole time I was trying to have a solid, logical discussion about this.
I see the benefits and the drawbacks and am willing to work with those drawbacks but for some reason she's in this mindset of ""I CAN'T I CAN'T"" where as I think she can, but she doesn't want to and won't.

Reddit, wat do? I'm really torn on this because I care about this girl a lot but I feel I would be passing up a huge opportunity here on something that I believe can be worked on but she doesn't. 

===EDIT===

I've been speaking with her about this all day and have been trying to convince her to come with me. It's not impossible and she did a human rights internship in Kenya for 3 months. 3 months isn't a year, but she has experience living in another culture. 

And Reddit is correct when stating that she has the opportunity to find a job over there. Hell, she has a BA in English and can teach ESL easily. I have offered to pay for everything and get her setup but she's saying that because I flip flopped she is uncertain about everything. She is asking me what I would do if the situation were reversed. I stated that if it was the same deal where she would put me up and cover me while I'm over there, then yes. She's not completely discounting this possibility but she is very upset with me for basically leading her on last night saying I wouldn't go and then saying I wanted to go but for her to  come with me if I get the job. ARGH. I'm applying and discussing still, we'll she if she gets on board or not. 

Thanks, Reddit. You guys and gals are something special. :)

We've decided we don't want to break up over this and to try LDR. Thanks for all the advice guys!"

How hard is it to get in? I've heard it's notoriously hard to get into CMU and I don't doubt that.
I'm hoping that my CS/Art combo might help me since I'll be able to have both
CS projects and art to add to my portfolio. But do I need a 4.0 to get in? I also work on campus in the IT department
as part of a student development team which may help in that it seems most of the work done in the program is done with
groups since it shows I know how to interact productively with my peers on a professional level.

Second, how were the costs for students from out-of-state? Did you recieve any aid besides FAFSA stuff?



At the moment I'm thinking of applying to the Entertainment Technology Center for their M.E.T. program.
I have a few questions about the program since it's relatively new and unique compared to other CS programs.

What was your application experience? What was your prior schooling experience and what advice do you have 
for someone like me?

What is the program like? What do you do? Is it fun?

How did it help you in the long run? Does CMU have connections with developers with regards to internships or employment?
Do you feel like it adequately prepared you for a career in games or other multimedia?


I know this might be kind of a niche question but I always hold hope that someone on reddit could help.
Responses to any of these questions would be greatly appreciated."

But, I've always been a great employee and a hard worker, and I absolutely love accounting.  

I've got a 3.4 overall GPA, and since I've come back to school for accounting/business my major GPA is a 4.0.  I hold an officer position with BAP.  I tutor Financial and Managerial Accounting for my university, as well as Micro and Macroeconomics.  I got a 650 on my GMAT.  I'll be starting graduate school in the spring.  

I failed miserably at this recruiting season.  

I failed to get an interview with GT.  They were my top choice.  I had two interns with their ambassador program invite me to an invitation-only social.  When they were discussing who to choose for interviews, I had two new-hires advocate for me.  Still rejected.  

I had a campus interview with McGladrey, and despite a professor  telling them that I'd be great, I didn't get an office interview.  I also didn't hear back from PwC or a regional firm after campus interviews.  

I've made a lot of sacrifices by quitting my job and coming back to school.  I'm already a work-a-holic and I know where ever I end up I'll be valuable.  I sort of thought accounting was a great field for smart, hard-working people, and I'm in a super big rut after all this rejection.  

The only thing I can think to do now is run for President of BAP next semester (I have a pretty good shot of winning).  But, being an officer didn't seem to help me, so I don't know if I'll just be spinning my wheels and working myself to death for nothing (I plan on taking 4 grad classes, and hopefully still tutoring--either as a GA or with the academic resource center where I work now).  

I guess I'm just looking for a little advice or encouragement.  I never thought wanting a career in public accounting would start to feel like a pipe dream...

TL;DR I'm a great student.  Professors, interns and new-hires have advocated for me, but the firms seem to hate me.  I'm pretty depressed after all this rejection and I'm starting to feel like my hard work means nothing.  I could most likely be President of BAP next semester, but I'm not even sure if it will be worth it...      "

The Campus: The University of Minnesota, Morris is a residential four-year undergraduate public liberal arts college serving 1,900 students.  It is one of only seven public liberal arts colleges ranked in Carnegie’s “national” category, and combines the liberal arts educational mission with moderate tuition costs that make it accessible to broader segments of the public than most private institutions. Our campus has been one of the Forbes Magazine “Best Buy” colleges in several recent years. UMM is also a national leader in green technology, and is frequently “grid-negative” due to two commercial-grade wind turbines and the nation’s first operational corn-stover-based biomass gasification plant.  

The Students: Admissions are selective, and the dominant student culture is hardworking and serious. The majority of the student body is from the rural and small town mainstream of the Midwest; however, the Morris student body is also one of the most ethnically diverse in the University of Minnesota system, with 20% students of color (12% are American Indian students) and a growing international student population.  

Location: One of five campuses of the University of Minnesota, UMM is located 160 miles west of Minneapolis in the rural community of Morris, MN (population 5,000). 

Advantages: Small college life-style coupled with access to the University of Minnesota’s research support, libraries and information technology, and excellent students. Salaries are competitive with mid-tier liberal arts colleges, and fringe benefits are competitive with top tier research universities. 

Colleagues: The economics and management program is an integrated department with a collegial faculty of seven persons working together to fashion an outstanding student experience centered on undergraduate learning and research. Our faculty includes both heterodox and mainstream economists. 

Teaching: UMM places a strong emphasis on excellence in undergraduate teaching, and therefore we are seeking a person who has a genuine commitment in this regard.  The standard annual teaching load is five semester courses of four credits each.  Classroom and program innovation are encouraged, and excellent opportunities exist for institutional funding of educational innovations.  

Research: The pursuit of an active research or creative program is expected of all faculty members at UMM, and in economics the expectation is that faculty will publish in refereed journals.  We are particularly interested in faculty who may involve undergraduates in their professional endeavors.  Internal funds are routinely available for student research, and Morris faculty have access to the full range of University of Minnesota faculty research funds on a competitive basis, as well as some specific funds reserved for faculty on our campus.  

Affirmative Action: The University of Minnesota is committed to the policy that all persons shall have equal access to its programs, facilities, and employment without regard to race, color, creed, religion, national origin, sex, age, marital status, disability, public assistance status, veteran status, or sexual orientation.

ABD, with a plan for degree completion, in Economics or a related field (for appointment at Instructor rank); 
evidence of successful undergraduate college teaching experience;
evidence of a promising research program.

Yes, we're young and stupid. Bear with me. I'll try to keep it short and cut details that probably don't affect anything outside my over-analyzing.

I became good friends with a girl two years ago. She soon got into an 18 month relationship, but when they broke up in March 2011, I become her support system. We're soon best friends, especially once I get an internship in her city this summer. She soon has a pet name for me, we're texting/Facebook chatting multiple times a day, flirting, joking about what it'd be like if we were together, and cuddling. But I figured it was all platonic and I had long been friend zoned.

At summer's end, she says we could be more than friends. I had mixed feelings and turned her down, saying I would probably screw a relationship up, I didn't want to lose her as a friend, our dynamic might not translate as a couple, blah. She took it exceptionally well, and we hung out even more than before, though we stopped cuddling and she stopped calling me by my pet name.

But in the six weeks following, the fact that dating her was a possibility made me rethink and realize I wanted her. Two weeks ago I asked her on a date. She said yes immediately, but said it was out of nowhere and now *she* didn't want to lose *me* as a friend. I said we should just take it slow.

That's when things changed. She stopped initiating conversation, or replying to my texts besides one word or sentence, which is out of character. She can never make plans. To be fair, she had started to manage a student government election campaign that week, which was eating her time, but the degree to which communication dropped off seemed disproportionate. I call her late Friday and we talk for 75 minutes; she admitted she felt weird, had been stressed by the campaign but also used it as a reason to avoid me, and was seriously worried about losing me as a friend. She felt that us being best friends put pressure on the relationship to be a long-term commitment from the beginning. I offered her to call off the whole thing but she wanted to wait until after the campaign distractions ended.

Election finished two days ago. Yesterday, she invites me to see a band she knows from home with her and her housemates. I go, and we talk casually, but she avoids me one-on-one. The more she drinks the more she comments on the cuteness of the band members. Near the end of the night, I ask her if she's free to hang/talk this weekend, and she says yes but won't get more specific in plans besides saying she'll text me when she's available (which by this point I instinctively doubt she'll do). I then head to the bar area before leaving, where one of her housemates lets me know that the girl in question was drunkenly trying to give her number to a band member. I start to leave, a little annoyed (she's giving away her number while I'm 10 feet away?), at which point she calls after me to have a good night, while using my pet name for the first time in months.

I'm seriously confused, and I'm getting mixed advice from different people to either call her immediately, vs. give her space then call, vs. wait for her to call me, vs. give up entirely, and whether to even talk and convince her to date or just invite her to a test date. I'm tired of trying to talk to her and feeling like she's giving me courtesy answers rather than a conversation. I feel like I'm simultaneously being led on and rejected by a girl, while I've also lost my best friend. I have little experience with relationships, and I don't know how much of this ambivalence &amp; mixed signals should be considered normal considering our history as friends. 

I've cut out details that may factor in to her behavior mostly because I know I have no sense of perspective, but questions are welcome. Thanks in advance."
lu1v6,3,2011-10-30,You're a bitch!,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/lu1v6/youre_a_bitch/,"We met years ago and I never thought we would have a child together. We do now though. How can you justify not letting me see my daughter?


When we were first together, we couldn't get enough of each other. We skipped class and work just to spend time with each other. We couldn't keep our hands off each other either. It was perfect.

Then you cheated on me. 

How could I keep trusting you? You apologized, you appeared to be truly remorseful. I fell for the act. I forgave you. Did I ever trust you again? No. Did I stay with you and try and trust you? Yes. I started working over nights. Weeks went by, we grew a little distant. I got suspicious. I checked your instant messenger logs, and rightfully so, you had phone sex with someone we had both talked to, twice. You spoke of how you wanted to fuck him. I confronted you, you tried to reason it away and you got mad at me for not trusting you. How could you say I'm the one at fault when you clearly can't commit. Again, I forgave you, this time i kept my guard up even more. 


I still didn't trust you. I wanted to but I couldn't. I simply didn't want to be alone but I couldn't bring myself to put the effort into the relationship that you wanted. We kept sleeping together and I forgot all about it. Until we separated. We separated and you agreed to give me another shot. Neither of us ever wanted to be alone. Who can blame us? Being alone is rough, and it hurts. How can you give me another shot when the day after we break up you go and fuck someone else? You didn't confess this to me until a few weeks later. I obviously knew you and knew how you behaved because I confronted you. We weren't together but we were still sleeping together, you got on webcam for two of your guy friends, in the same night. It's not hard to figure out what you did for them on camera. I know that you are a submissive but you shouldn't submit to anyone who pretends to care about you.

Fast-Forward a year later. I had forgiven you, we had been living together for a few months. We weren't technically together but we were supporting each other emotionally. I still couldn't trust you. You had a job that was stressful, you finally quit. You got drunk and wanted sex. By the time we got home you were buzzed, you had simply mentally let go of stress for a night. You knew what was going on. We had sex, I asked you if I should pull out, You said no. I asked you if you were sure, You said you were sure. In that moment, I trusted you. I trusted that you knew your body and would get the morning after pill like you had before. The next morning you wouldn't get it. You assured me it would be okay.

About 6 weeks later, we find out that we are going to have a child. A wonderful surprise. Neither of us were ready for a child but we both have strong anti-abortion beliefs. We knew we were going to have a child. Because we were not ready, we wanted to look at other options, like a private adoption. You thought because of the private adoption I didn't want to have a child. In fact, I wanted to make sure she had the best opportunity at growing up.

All though your pregnancy I was there for you. I moved in with you so I could help you, take care of you. I got a job so I could support you and our child. I went with you to every doctors visit, even when work didn't like it. I got you everything you needed, I would cook for you and with you. I would drive you everywhere, I took you to and from school and from work because driving while pregnant is more risky and I didn't want anything happening to our child. We quickly abandon that idea. Your sister has been down this path so we ask her for advice. To make sure our daughter gets healthcare she advises that we add my name to the birth certificate at a later time (a few weeks or months after she is born)

I took care of the both of you. As your belly grew larger, we grew more and more excited. She would respond to my voice when I was around and I loved feeling her kick. She is a part of me and a part of you. She is a link between us that will always be.

We picked out a new place to live, planned out the nursery.

As the days counted down to our child arriving and to moving into our new apartment. We stayed close. We kept sleeping together. Things were perfect. Until the day before she arrived. We got in a huge fight, you threatened to walk out on me. In fact, you pretty much did. 

Once a man loses his love and his child, what motivation is there left for him in life? I made comments about suicide because you didn't seem to care how hurt I was. I had lost it all. You called the police. They showed up, took me to the hospital for an evaluation. I swore I had lost everything. You came back. You signed me out. I bared my soul and told you how much that all hurt me and how sorry I was for making those comments. I am on anti-depressants now. It's okay though. I welcome the help. You are bi-polar but refuse to get treatment. You think you control it, but you don't. 

The next day you were scheduled to have our daughter. She didn't like that, so she decided to come at 5am in the morning. You wanted to shower to relax some, I helped you in the shower, I helped bathe you, get you dressed, and get you to the hospital.

We made it. We made it to the hospital and I was there by your side the whole time. I never wanted to leave. We did all the paperwork and as we discussed we left my name off the birth certificate to make sure she had healthcare. I stayed as long as I could and went to finish packing our things for the move the next day. I came back in time for you to be discharged. You went home with your family so you wouldn't have to worry about the move. I didn't want you to think anything of it. I wanted our new place to be perfect for you when you came home with me and our daughter. 

You leave with your family, and I go home and continue packing with the help of my family (who you despise by the way). 8 hours until the movers arrive at 8AM in the morning, I've got my work cut out for me. This is where it all goes completely wrong. You send me a text telling me that you don't want to move. You don't tell me why other than you don't want to. I get upset but your phone goes straight to voicemail. You shut me out. I have no choice, I call the movers, I cancel the move. I figure this was a temporary setback. 

I sleep as much as I can. I wake to a call from the movers, I immediately cancel the move. I do what I can and start heading to your home to find out what is going on. I try and talk to you and figure out what the deal is with the apartment and so on. Your mother rudely butts in snapping at me speaking on your behalf. You say you don't ever want to move into this apartment. I start working on canceling the apartment. It's too late, we've already signed the lease. It's going to cost at least $1,000 to get out of the lease at this point and it did. It cost right around $1,200.

I figure this was just you being nervous. I stick with it. I take some time off from work to help you take care of our daughter. Your family is very dominant. From the beginning I'm almost shut out already. I stay with you at your home for 2 weeks. You go back to work a week after you have her to finish your internship and graduate. It's tough and you power through it. You are amazing. I drive you to and from work because you're exhausted. 

After some time though, I have to go back to work. I go back to work for a week and I realize something is wrong, your being distant. I call you, and I confront you. You tell me you don't want to be in a relationship with me. So there it is, the cat is out of the bag. You wait till our daughter is 3 weeks old to tell me you don't want to be in a relationship with me. I understand. I don't even get mad. We make arrangements for child support and you promise to let me see my daughter. 

Over the last 6 months of her life I've seen her about 6 times. Once a month on average for about 2 hours. Why is this? I pay my child support. I constantly ask you when I can see her. You keep making excuses that work is so busy for you. I've had to resort to getting a lawyer, I'm going to have to take you to court.

You have broken every promise you have ever made to me. You promised not to keep her from me. You promised me we could put my name on her birth certificate later on. You gave me a reason not to trust you years ago, why did I trust you? Why did I give you the benefit of the doubt? You've burned me every time I tried to help you.

How can you be so cold? How can you be so evil?

TL:DR; I stuck my dick in crazy.

ltqj1,0,2011-10-29,"Best friend asked me out, I said no... Two months later, I asked her, she said yes, but is sending mixed signals. Next step? (cross from r/relationshipadvice)",potentialexfriend,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/ltqj1/best_friend_asked_me_out_i_said_no_two_months/,"**I'll try to cut it down from the [original](http://redd.it/lswpy).**

Male, 21 (me); female, 20. Yes, we're young and stupid. Bear with me. I'll also try to stick to facts instead of my over-analysis.

We became good friends two years ago. She soon got into an 18 month relationship, and I became her support system after the March 2011 break-up. We're soon best friends, especially once I get an internship in her city this summer. I earn a pet name, we're hanging out often, texting/Facebook chatting multiple times a day, flirting, joking about what it'd be like if we were together, and eventually cuddling. But I figured it was all platonic and I had long been friend zoned.

Late August, she says we could be more than friends. I had mixed feelings and turned her down, saying I would probably screw up, I didn't want to risk the friendship, our dynamic might not translate as a couple, blah. We explicitly decided to leave the door open for later, and she took it exceptionally well, and we hung out even more than before, though we stopped cuddling and she stopped calling me by my pet name.

But in the six weeks following, I thought it over (now with the mindset that dating was a *possibility*) and realized I wanted her. Two weeks ago I asked her on a date. She said yes immediately, but said it was out of nowhere and now she didn't want to lose *me* as a friend. I said we should just take it slow.

That's when things changed. She stopped initiating conversation, and replied to texts with one word or sentence at most; all out of character. She could never make plans. I soon feared I was annoying her. To be fair, she got busy managing a student government election campaign that week, but the degree to which communication dropped off seemed disproportionate. I called her late Friday and we talk for 75 minutes; she admitted she felt weird, had been stressed by the campaign but also used it as a reason to avoid me, and was seriously worried about losing me as a friend. She felt our history put pressure on any relationship to *have to* work out long-term. I offered her to call off the whole thing, but she wanted to wait until after the campaign distractions ended.

Election finished Wednesday. Thursday, she invites me to see a band she knows from home with her and her housemates. I go, and we talk casually, but she avoids me one-on-one. The more she drinks the more she comments on the cuteness of the band members. Near the end of the night, I ask her if she's free to hang/talk this weekend, and she says yes but won't get more specific besides saying she'll text me when she's available (as of this post Saturday night: no text). A housemate then informs me in private that the girl in question was drunkenly trying to give her number to a band member. I start to leave, a little annoyed (she's giving away her number while I'm 10 feet away?), at which point she calls after me to have a good night, while using my pet name for the first time in months.

I'm confused. I've gotten mixed advice from different people (call her now vs. give her space and call later vs. wait for her to call; talk it over vs. invite her to a first date since she said yes); and for the most part other girls have assured me that giving her number away means nothing and one-word responses are still a good sign and just meant she was busy (vs. not replying at all). But it's worn down on me, trying to converse with my best friend and feeling like she's not trying to converse back. I feel like I've lost her friendship *and* been rejected by a great girl. I've been told she's probably insecure from when I rejected her, and I would try to assure her it was all my fault that I did, but I feel like I can't until she gives me the chance to talk.

I've cut out a lot of minor details that may or may not affect her behavior because I feel I have no perspective, but feel free to ask questions."
lvsmx,3,2011-10-31,Big 4 background checks?,LargeBlackWoman,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/lvsmx/big_4_background_checks/,"So here's my story. Right now I'm waiting for a summer internship offer with a big 4, and I'm really close to finding out. I'm very confident I will get the internship. Of course, I filled out the necessary forms a while ago, when my record was clean of any misdemeanor, crimes, basically any bad thing, legally.

This weekend I got slammed with underage drinking (I'm 20) and open container in public tickets. Additionally, I was technically ""arrested"" and fingerprinted in the cop car, but did not go to jail.

I am EXTREMELY concerned. I am supposed to go to court in late November and my family is talking to a lawyer to get advice. I figured I would come here though to see what any of you guys have to say.

I know I'm kind of ""counting my chickens before they hatch"" by assuming I will get this internship and then even go on to assume I will do a good enough job to get a full time job for when I graduate. BUT I'm really wondering how these tickets will affect this possibility? Does anyone have any similar experiences? Any knowledge in big 4 background checks maybe? Or any advice or encouraging words about being able to get these charges removed from my record? If, in the end, the firm will see these charges, do they take them very seriously? I know our lawyer will have more sound advice, but I'm just posting to see what r/accounting knows about this kind of thing.

Thanks in advance. Also, if you're going to post and say I'm screwed, even if it's true, please consider not posting. Because I already am feeling super depressed and stupid about this whole thing and I'm the type of person who won't be able to stop thinking about this for one second until it's settled. "
