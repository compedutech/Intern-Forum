Pretty damn bad, I know.  

My assumption is that there is basically no point in me trying to get an actual job right now due to my low GPA and lack of experience, so I should try to work my way up through an internship.  

I'm also currently studying for the FE mechanical exam, in the hopes that passing it will at least minutely offset my very lackluster GPA.  "
55bpml,0,2016-10-01,F4M Some fun scenes!,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/55bpml/f4m_some_fun_scenes/,"Hey there DPP, tonight I have a couple scenes for you all to choose from and/or work out with me!

We can discuss specific prompts in private and please, do not message me with a scene already started, that’s the easiest way to get blocked. The same goes for one line/word messages.

I'm fairly open with my kinks with my only hard ""no""s being scat, unrealistically huge cocks, 3rd person writing, and vomit.

Without further ado, here are some of my prompts:

**The Lawyer and the Con**: For this one, I was thinking I’d play a young and up and coming lawyer tasked with defending you. We can discuss the specifics in PMs but one thing is for certain, I’ll be taking my payment in the form of cock.

**Breaking the Law**: For this one, the roles are reversed, I was caught committing a crime and you’re the officer/journalist/detective who caught me. Where that leads? Well that’s up to you.

**Wrong neighborhood**: What happens when me, a young and sexy girl finds herself in the wrong neighborhood? Do you help me find my way or decide you want to take advantage?

**Sports Star and Reporter**: A classic scene were I’m a reporter and you’re the sports star, that can only lead one place, right?

**The intern and the boss**: Fairly self explanatory, I’d love to be the intern at her dream job who meets you, her boss and potentially so much more.

**Opposite Sides**: For this one, I want to play a FBI/CIA/DEA Agent who is tasked with infiltrating your organization, now what that organization does we can discuss in PMs but I basically want you to turn me from righteous agent of the law into your slut.

**I’m gonna fuck your sister**: For this one, you’ll play my little brother’s best friend, I’ll be his big sister who is now recently single and back in town. You guys always joked that you would fuck each other’s mom/sister only this time, you’re not joking.

**Giving back**: In this RP, I’ll play someone  famous be it an actress or singer or sports star. You’ll be the person tasked in helping me set up some sort of event to give back to the community, only you want me to give you something more than this event.

**Bullies always win**: In this one, you’ll be as the title suggests, you’re a bully who grew up terrorizing my son (or brother), only unlike the stories we tell our kids to make them feel better, you know better. You get what you want, when you want it, in this case, me.

For those of you so inclined, I do like playing celebs in any of these roles so we have visual aids, if you’d like me to be any, just ask!

As for celebs I’d play, here are a few, feel free to ask about ones not listed:

Celebs: **Mary Elizabeth Winstead**, **Maisie Williams**, Anna Kendrick, Selena Gomez, Hailee Steinfeld, Taylor Swift, Willa Holland, Daisy Ridley, **Melissa Benoist**, Emma Stone/Watson/Roberts, Hayley Williams, Alison Brie, Alexandra Daddario, Aubrey Plaza, Bella Thorne, **Alicia Vikander** Jennifer Lawrence, Keri Russel, Neve Campbell, Jennifer Connelly, Scarlet Johansson, Sophie Turner, Oliva Munn, Olivia Wilde, **Miranda Kerr**, Jessica Biel/Alba, Victoria Justice

YouTube/Social Media: **Meg Turney**, Lia Marie Johnson, **Alli Speed**, Barbara Dunkelman, Ashley Jenkins, **Bree Essrig**, Maude Garrett, Trisha Hershberger, Datev Gallagher, Lindsey Stirling, Christina Grimme, Dodger, iJustine, or Meghan Camarena.

Whew, that was a lot. Hope to get some dirty orangereds soon!

Just so we're clear, everyone I'm playing in this post is 18+, so the prompts would take place in the future."
55capd,15,2016-10-01,What Can We Expect Next From The DEA?,anoldusername,kratom,https://www.reddit.com/r/kratom/comments/55capd/what_can_we_expect_next_from_the_dea/,"Let's talk a little strategy here. We've got a ton of really smart people here, and it's clear that many of us have some degree of experience with law, politics, public service and policy, and negotiating. Why don't we tap into some of our brainpower and see if we can help generate some ideas for AKA going forward.

Personally, I'm no high-level expert by any means, but I do have experience in politics and public policy. So I'll start by throwing out a few of my thoughts.

I think the most important thing to keep in mind is that the DEA has put itself into a position where it has no choice but to double down and fight to the death. Their opening position was so extreme, there's no way at all they can back away from it - they left themselves no space. They didn't say, ""we think this stuff is probably pretty bad, so we're going to start getting tougher on it"" - they said, ""kratom is a deadly, addictive substance, with no redeeming qualities whatsoever, period. and we need to ban it immediately to keep people form being killed by this grave and immediate danger. we have no choice, we must act immediately, because this is a life and death emergency!"" 

Well, where ya gonna go from there? What are they gonna say? 

""Ah, well, we changed our minds.""

""Maybe it's not so bad after all.""

""Oops, we were thinking of some other drug, sorry.""

""Ha - we were just kidding!"" 

Nope. They're screwed. If they back off now and don't ban it, or even delay the ban for any length of time, they're admitting that they were full of shit from the start. Because if they really did believe that it was an emergency, an imminent threat to public safety, how can they explain postponing the ban for, say, a year? They'd get roasted in congress. It's either a terrible danger, that has to be acted on immediately to save innocent lives, or it isn't. 

I can't for the life of me figure out how someone as politically inept as Rosenberg managed to buy his way into that job. This was a foolish move on his part. You don't ever draw that kind of a line in the sand without being absolutely certain there's nothing out there that can make you erase it. This was just fucking foolish.

And because he was such a fucking incompetent assclown, we're in a much tougher position than we would have been in had he taken a more moderate approach. He can't compromise, and it's going to be much more difficult to offer him anything that would allow him to save face. He doesn't dare lose this fight, or he'll reveal himself to be a moron. He has no choice but to fight to the death. He's taken a position that he now has no choice but to defend. 

So, what does this mean? Well, for one thing, it's going to be expensive. AKA is going to need tons of money, because the DEA will throw busloads of lawyers at this. We're going to need to counter their moves with research and very sharp, aggressive lawyers, and that means beaucoup bucks. 

Also, we really REALLY need friends in congress. We can't do it without them. We need our congressional allies to be willing to stand tall and demand that Rosenberg prove his case, and not let him squirm away with some bullshit. I suspect that's why a lot of legislators may have been reluctant to sign the letters - I would think most of them recognize that Rosenberg is going to make a fight of it, and they didn't want to commit themselves to that battle. Gives me all the more respect for those who did. 

So, I think we need to keep pressuring the legislators who didn't sign, and keep the heat on. I think it would also be helpful to send thanks to those who did sign - I don't mean harass their interns, but send them thank-you e-mails and tweets letting them know that we really appreciate it and respect them, and try to get as many other voters as we can to do the same. 

Again, don't flood them with questions or shit that would require them to respond, or tie up their staff - the last thing we want to do is be pests and make them regret getting onboard with us. Just let them know we're really grateful, and we'll do everything we can to get them as many votes as we can. Because that's how you pay elected officials back - we want to keep taking kratom, they want to keep being legislators. They're going out on a limb to scratch our backs, and we need to let them know that we're at least trying to scratch theirs.

I would suggest that someone work on ways to keep this in the news, and hit the press hard with lots of positive stories about how this stuff changes people's lives, as well as factual data refuting the DEA's lies. My suggestion would be that someone at AKA should coordinate this effort as much as possible, or at least suggest some guidelines so that we're all on message, but I think we should all be thinking of ideas along those lines. 

Does anyone know of any celebrity kratomers? It would be nice if we had a Brad Pitt or Meryl Streep out there as one of the faces of kratom, telling America how important it is in their lives and how harmless it is. We don't want Ozzy Osbourne, god bless 'im (no offense, Ozzie, but I'm sure you comprende), or Willie Nelson. We want cleancut, wholesome types who everyone identifies with.

In that vein, what about other famous and successful people? Doctors, lawyers, business people, even politicians? I don't necessarily mean front page celebrities, but just regular, successful community members, like your local city councilmember or the economics professor at the local college. Anyone know any of those types who would be willing to step forward and be interviewed?

Well, this post is long enough. What are everyone else's thoughts on this? Who has other ideas?"
55cvvr,1,2016-10-01,[F4M] 18 Want to be a daddy/teacher/protector to a petite Asian girl? (multiple prompts),ecoNOMNOMics,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/55cvvr/f4m_18_want_to_be_a_daddyteacherprotector_to_a/,"Hey, first time posting here. Recently turned 18 and I've been recommended here after posting in the wrong subreddit. 

**What I look like**: Petite, slim, Asian 5'5, 110lbs, my ex could practically wrap around my waist with his hands, A cup (yay if that's your thing, if not, sorry), also have really small hands 

**Kinks &amp; Fantasy Scenarios:** 

1. *Snugglefuck* 
I have a particular fantasy of having a taller and stronger partner/stranger protecting me. 
I would imagine us going to a bar/club/festival etc and someone would try to grope me or do something that makes me very uncomfortable. You would step in and tell them to back off and basically be alpha. I'd be extremely grateful and feel safe and protected. When we get home, I would thank you in many ways.... ;)
Then after we've finished I would tuck myself beside you and cuddle with you with my head on your chest and wait for round two. 

2. *Daddy* 
Basically you're a very successful, driven and ambitious man, I'm a new intern at your company who's a little clumsy but eager to learn. We run into each other one day and I fall for you (literally). I'm thinking this can either evolve into a sugar daddy scenario or just a daddy one where you're my mentor and we have fun in the office. One of the things I really want to do is blowing you under the desk while you're in a call with a client/doing work related tasks and you're trying to concentrate but I'm just too damn distracting and we can end up 69ing or whatever you want. 

3. Teacher/Student 
I've had a crush on you, my English teacher, for the past few weeks. I always sit in the front closest to your podium, first to arrive and last to leave because I'm a straight-A student and...well you're teaching it (Orwell's 1984 if that's your thing). At first I think I'm just one of the many girls sighing over your good looks and charisma but then I start noticing whenever you start teaching sexual content, you make eye contact with me just long enough to catch my attention but not to get caught by the others.
""Class dismissed, don't forget your chapter readings, have a lovely weekend everyone!""
""You too, Mr ______ !"", I answer back cheerfully. 
As I strolled out from the building, I was greeted with pouring rain and howling winds. Shit. I checked my phone and saw a message from mum that saying she has a work emergency and that I'll have to catch the bus home. I rubbed the goosebumps on my arms and trudged along in the rain, instantly soaking my white blouse and pleat skirt. Suddenly I hear a voice....

4. Brazilian Jiujitsu/Judo Class
This is my first time going to a self defence class and you're one of the black belts there, tall, built and confident. 
The instructor walks in and announces 'hey everyone listen up, new student today NomNom.' I feel the weight of the stares of everyone watching as I set down my gym gear and stripped down sweats and shirt to reveal my sports bra and running shorts. 
'Today we're going to practice some submission holds, partner up!' 
I look around as people paired up and just as I was about to see if the instructor was free I felt a tap on my shoulder. 
'Looks like you're stuck with me', you smirked mischievously. 
It would be awesome if you have knowledge of BJJ classes, basically I have the idea of building up sexual tension as I get put into uncomfortable positions by you, then after class you can maybe offer to teach me 1 on 1?

So these are the scenarios I've thought of so far, I'm very new so I'm open to any spins you may have or completely new scenarios :) 

I'm especially turned on by being eaten out, light bondage, and height difference (taller haha). 
I'm also up for just chatting especially if you genuinely fit into the scenarios above.

Look forward to reading your messages when I wake up!

55cwbp,5,2016-10-01,(F4M) - The Domination of Ariel Winter. [multi-para][celeb][long term][kink],modern_family_dpp,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/55cwbp/f4m_the_domination_of_ariel_winter/,"**I'm going to be here all day! If you're wanting to roleplay, please don't hesitate to PM me. Even if it gets too late to start tonight, we can always set something up for another time!**

Before you read on, I am **only** looking for multi-paragraph roleplayers that are willing and able to play their characters in the 3rd person. And please, create/have a character... I don't want you playing yourself (or any version of yourself) in this play.

Now for the good stuff, I want to play [Ariel Winter](http://i.imgur.com/0tP58CL.jpg) in a fairly long-term roleplay scenario. 

Ariel Winter is an actress most famously known for playing the character Alex Dunphy on the TV show Modern Family. Please have at least some idea of who she is or at least the TV show. And if you're looking for a cum n done type scene, just skip over me because you won't get what you want here.

--------------------------------------------------

Ariel stood in front of the mirror in her trailer. Staring at her bare breasts and her dummy as she nervously bit her lip.

Suddenly she was yanked out of her thoughts when a production intern yelled loudly from outside her trailer door.

""Miss Winter!""

Ariel turned and looked at her agent sitting on the couch. She wasn't sure what she should do. She was already half an hour late for her scene, but in truth, she just wasn't ready for it yet and was hoping he would buy her some more time.

""She'll be out in a damn minute!"" Gary yelled back to the intern standing outside.

""Just relax honey..."" He said in a softer voice as he put down the script he was reading and stood up from the sofa.

""I'm trying"" She replied softly in an almost whine. Ariel knew that she had become known for her curves, but she never could see what everyone else did. When she looked in the mirror, she was still just a chubby little nerdy girl and hardly the young, voluptuous vixen the rest of America saw.

""You look great and they're paying us a lot of money for you to shoot this scene."" He continued to reassure her about the upcoming topless scene she was about to shoot less than a month and a half after her 18th birthday.

Of course, they weren't paying *them* they were paying *her*, but as her agent, he often used the word *us* to emphasize that her career was not her own.

Her mother had hired him thinking he was just sleazy enough to let her take control of Ariel's career through him, but the first thing he did was take her away from her family, and negotiate for Ariel to star in this movie.

""You're not little Alex Dunphy anymore, honey. We've got to show the world that you're really an *adult* star now.""

--------------------------------------------------

Bonus points for creativity and kink too! (as far as kinks I'm interested in... being dominated is the biggest, plus any kind of cumplay, pregnancy, anal, and just generally rough sex)

If you want to know the best way to catch my attention... type up an intro to the scene that you'd like to play in your first message. I get more than a few messages and sometimes I just have to skip over the messages that are short and vague, even though you might be a great roleplayer."
55d71m,4,2016-10-01,Sometimes you should be afraid,abh_1234,stories,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/55d71m/sometimes_you_should_be_afraid/,"4 years ago, during my internship, I was placed in another city by my employer for training purposes, it mostly in the outskirts of the city. 

Some said it's a peaceful land, good nature and fresh air which was at its best every morning with a beautiful sunrise and the moment the sun rays reaches the trees and the leaves every thing appears to be gold. Nobody in the office ever wished to go there and I cursed my destiny for being sent there, but after a month I felt as if I was in heaven as everything was serene, calm and peaceful and then the day soon arrived when I realized why they didn't wanted to come here. 

It was late in the office, 11.42 pm, Friday, 18 June 2012, when I was tired and ask the driver to take me into the my room. He said it's not safe to go out today and he and other staffs have prepared a room for me in the well furnished manner as possible. I asked the reason and they couldn't answer, so I almost snatched the keys from his hand, I shouldn't have done that because what followed was a nightmare that nobody knows. 

I was driving along the very dark road, it was creepy and the very silence was haunted by the dark, suddenly a hand appeared out of the darkness, I stopped the car. For few moments, I freezed, then a minute later, a man appeared and asked me for help. I got out of the car, he then said his car is down and his wife needs to be admitted into the hospital immediately as she was having a labor pain. So without wasting another minute, we helped her to my car and we drove off as fast as possible. 

To diffuse the tension, I asked the man what he is expecting, a girl or boy? Then he said girl or boy doesn't matter, both are equal for him and all he wants that she and the unborn child survives, I could understand his tension. So in few minutes, we reached the hospital, when he said me to go to maternity ward and get the doctors alongwith the other setup ready while he helps her wife out of the car and he handed over his and her IDs.

I complied and in a couple of minutes, bought a stretcher with ward boys to carry her to the maternity room, but to my surprise they were not in the car, I thought they must be inside by now but I was again wrong. I searched the hospital and began yelling at the hospital staff, but they were not found. A old security guard asked me whether i was searching for a man and a pregnant lady, I was relieved to know that the man knew where they went and I nodded. He said they were dead already, and they died in this very hospital, in 2010. I was so angry that I wished to beat him very badly but I maintained my cool as he was an aged man. 

I asked him for the proof, so he took me to the old medical records of the hospital and said is this the man and the wife I am talking about, I said yes and to my horror the file contained their death certificates in which man was deceased at 12.42 am and woman was deceased at 12.50 am on 19th June. I was both shocked and in horror, he further said, they died due to a car accident and now I could figure out why did the husband said the car was down, then my hands fell on my pockets, I was frightened further when I found there was no ids only sands as if it was the remains of the cremated.

Cristina. I never really loved her until Season 7 and the PTSD storyline (her friendship with Derek was AMAZING) but she grew on me. I loved Cristina and Burke's relationship and I'm happy they gave them some closure before her departure. Her ending was perfect, I cried like a baby.

I also loved how they got rid off the interns (Shane and Leah), they didn't had to kill them (like Charles, Reed and Heather) or cut them off abruptly (like Sadie and Hahn). They gave them a decent ending.

Oh, and the Avery's. I don't like them, but the scene between April and Catherine was inspiring.

The only thing I didn't like was Maggie's twist. Another Lexie that, of course, turns out to be a surgeon.


TIL you don't have to kill off a character to make your fans cry. You can give it a great ending, with great *goodbye scenes* and it's much more satisfying to everyone."
55dydi,2,2016-10-01,Unsure about relationship,absie107,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/55dydi/unsure_about_relationship/,"Hey all. I'm [25f] currently I am LDR with my boyfriend [24m] and have been having some doubts about us. We've been together for nearly three years, and he moved to Germany for a year long internship program about 2.5 months ago. Since then, I've started medical school. Within a few weeks of him leaving, I realized I was making amazing friendships and was living the healthiest lifestyle I've had in a long time because I didn't have to make much time for him. I eat healthier, I exercise when I want, I study the right amount, and I can be completely independent without any relationship stress. I also have found myself very seriously checking out other guys, and daydreaming about being single. My SO clearly misses me more than I miss him, and I've discussed my feelings with him. I decided to try and give it some time, because I do love him and miss him, but i feel like I'm just continuing in this relationship because I don't know if I could stand how he would deal with us breaking up. 

In the meantime, he has been pressuring me to buy a plane ticket to see him, and I keep putting it off because I feel uncomfortable about all of this. At the end of the day, we have been dating for this long, and I don't really see a future with this guy. It's been easy to be with him because he lives close to me, but it feels more like a best friend than necessarily someone I want to be in a relationship with. I love him, but I'm not only not as attracted to him as I used to be, I also just love th freedom I have to be on my own now that he is away. I try to reason my way out of FOMO but it is persistently on my mind. I feel like a horrible person for feeling this way. Any advice? Thanks in advance. "

“And this one goes out to Alison Simmons from her boyfriend Daniel. Daniel says that so much has happened in the 3 months you've been together and can't wait for the birth of your child in 4 months time. Well, that’s very sweet of you, Daniel however your grasp of biology and maths leaves a lot to be desired. Anyway, here’s your request of Beyonce with Halo, on 1308 Kings Lake FM…”. Matthew Newman clicked Play, waited for the red light to go out and blew out his cheeks as the music started. 3:45 seconds to head down the hall and get a coffee from the vending machine. His personal best was 2:55. He loved it when they requested Meatloaf, he could even make it to the vending machine on the floor above when “Bat out of Hell” was on. That one had King sized chocolate bars! He lifted his old coffee cup and pointed it towards Adrian on the other side of the glass window. Adrian, the shows producer, didn't notice. He was too busy in conversation with that new blonde intern, who had a serious look on her face. Grateful he saved the 90p on Adrians latte, he made a quick dash to the door, and headed down the corridor. 3:28 later and he was back opening the door with his forearm while holding a mocha and a packet of baked crisps, when a concerned looking Adrian emerged from the adjoining room. 
“Erm Matt, we’ve kinda got a situation here. There's a fella on the phone wanting to speak to you on air.”
“For christ sake, Aid” said Matthew. “ From the look on your boat race, I thought it was something important. Tell him to phone one of the shitty stations if he wants to hear himself on the radio. Listen Chief, gotta dash, the songs finishing. Newman edged the handle down and started to step inside. Adrian gripped the top of his arm, making Matthew stop. 
“Look Matt” Adrian ran his tongue across his sweating top lip. This guy, he says, ugh, he says he's gonna kill someone if he doesn't speak to you on air.” They stared at each other for a moment before Matthew laughed.
“Ha, come on, man! Don’t be fooled by shit like that!  At my old station, we got nutters like that once a week, mate It’s probably one of them.” Adrian didn't look convinced.
“Er, I dunno buddy. It seems kinda weird, this guy, he’s just kinda creepy. Ya know? Are you sure it’s one of the cranks?” Matthew Newman grinned the grin that was on billboards, bus stops and taxis all throughout the city.
“Aidy mucka, of course he's creepy, he's sayin’ he’ll off someone unless he goes on the radio. Take it easy, and trust me. You’ll never hear from him again.” With that, he was gone, the door slowly closing with a sssssssssup noise, as Adrian trudged back to the waiting phone call.

Ian Thomas was a 37 year old bus driver. In fact, he was a very good bus driver. He was always on the lookout for anyone hurrying towards his bus before he left. Once or twice, he’d opened the doors and let folk jump on. That got him a telling off, but he’d do it again in a heartbeat. Never grumbled if you handed him a £20 note. He just asked if he could keep the change, with a cheeky smirk. When anyone said “Single”, he’d reply “No, I’m married, thanks for asking. Good job, you never asked for a Quick Rider!”. And he was married. 14 years to Tina, his High School sweetheart. He was in the PTA, helped out at his eldest boys football practice, did the school run when he could, and still found time to hang out with his mates twice a week. And because of his initials, Ian and his friends were locally known as the ‘IT Crowd’. But for all that, all his good guy points, and his reputation as “one of the nicest fella’s a guy could meet” Ian Thomas was currently terrified. He was strapped to a hard wooden chair, that was bolted to floor in a room with no distinguishable marks at all. It was all so empty. The bare brick walls, the grimy bare floorboards, the single light hanging from the ceiling. And him. Naked apart from the Cookie Monster boxer shorts he got for Father's Day 2 years ago, his slight paunch covering the waistband. He’d shouted, he’d swore, he’d cried. But nothing. He screwed his eyes shut and tried to think exactly what the fuck had happened. He’d finished his shift at 11:10 and dropped the K23 Xpress back at the depot, walking along past the ‘Guards Rest’ pub, high-fiving one of the bouncers, cutting through Crowns Park...hang on, that weird guy near the swings,coming towards him,then ….then? Fuck! He couldn't think. A loud clunk and the door opened. Ian flinched. Many of the words Ian had learned in his 37 years now failed him. “ Who the f...h...wha..hello?” The figure walked slowly towards him. It was tall, slim. Most of ‘its’ body seemed to be covered in bin bags and duct tape. Its hands were bright yellow marigolds. The ‘face’ if you could call it that, was an old World War 2 gasmask.. It stopped about 4 feet short of Ian and knelt down. Ian never noticed at first but it was carrying a small clip-shut leather case, like Doctors used to use. And that terrified Ian, because this ‘thing’ clearly wasn't a Doctor. The bag was opened and it stood up. The sight of the shining silver scalpel in its hands kicked Ian into life. he started thrashing, struggling against the cable ties that dug deeper into his wrist and ankles. “ GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME, YOU BASTARD. PLEASE, LEAVE ME ALONE! I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING...TOMMY? IF THIS IS YOUR IDEA OF A FUCKING JOKE, I’M GONNA MURDER YOU, YOU LITTLE PRICK!”
It stepped forwards and slapped Ian across the face. Hard. Ian started to cry, snot and spit bubbling together. It grabbed Ian's hair and pulled his head back as far as it would stretch. A strangled cry escaped from Ian's mouth. “Argh, please...I’ve got kids.” Those were the last words from Ian Thomas’ mouth as it moved closer to his chest and started to carve.

Kings Lake town centre was exactly that. The centre of town. From the St Michael monument at its dead centre, the town stretched out into four streets in a very rough North, South, East and West direction. When Michael cast Lucifer out of Heaven, we can be quite sure he never thought he’d end up being surrounded by a McDonald's, HMV, Topshop and a John Lewis. It was a Saturday morning and later on, usually this place would be heaving. But not today,...David McGowan was about to change that. For the past 7 years, David has cleaned the streets of Kings Lake and no one really noticed him. Yeah, they SAW him, but no one really noticed him. He stood out in his work issue yellow polo shirt and trousers under a hi-vis vest, and a huge pair of headphones clamped over his ears. David had always liked listening to things. Ever since he was little, he loved listening to the radio. But not the music. the talking. They were always so nice. They talked and talked and they never got angry at him, or made fun of him. The people on the radio would talk about food, places to travel, cricket...all sorts of stuff and David would listen to it all. Just over a year ago, he got an ear infection and had to stop using his favourite in-ear headphones and he was so upset, he couldn’t focus on anything, let alone work. However, his Uncle Edward came round with a big comfy set of headphones, and even after his infection had cleared up, David still used the big set. He was so happy to have his ‘friends’ back. Up until now, today was panning out as usual. David had got up at 4am (his mum shouting up the stairs), he’d had his shower and change into his work clothes while his mum made his breakfast. Once he’d consumed the breakfast which hadn’t changed in the past 17 years, David made his mum a cup of tea as she went back to bed., and David started walking to work at 5:10. He got to work, got his bag, and set off to clean the streets. It was now 5:43 and David was trying to pick a kebab container with his pointey stick, while half looking at the underwear mannequins in the John Lewis window. He liked walking past during the day for the sweet perfume smells that t would drift out and beckon him in, almost like cartoon vapour fingers. A quick look to see if anyone was around and David stopped prodding at the polystyrene container, and moved closer to the glass, his nose almost touching. After several minutes of oogling all things lacy, David turned away in search of more things to jab-and-bag. He stepped out from under the Lewis doorway, and closer to the huge 17 foot statue of St Michael. Several beer cans were strewn on the floor closer to the statue. He stood in the middle of the cans and started to jab &amp; bag. He turned back towards the Lewis side to get the last one….and that’s when he saw it. He didn't know what ‘it’ was,but it stopped him dead. David turned and stared open mouthed. St Michael towered above him, his wings at a 10-2 angle….someone had tied a dummy to it in a mock crucifixion. David was gob smacked! Why do people have to be so...so...naughty? It was very lifelike, it even had a wig of short brown hair, going a tad grey at the sides. David moved a little closer Stopped, narrowed his eyes. Closer still. His trainers catching a stray beer can, which sent it skittering noisily against the concrete making David jump. He laughed, and stepped closer again..actually, it was VERY lifelike! There was something written on its chest..another step...was that?...surely not...David’s stomach lurched to the side, his hands clamped to his mouth as both bag and stick clattered to the floor. He turned and ran. Past Lewis’, down side streets and back over the footbridge that spanned the river Gale. His limbs ached but he kept on going, his feet clumping on the slick road. He half stumbled through gate, and up to the door, his thumb jammed against the bell. A ringing could be heard from within as he gulped down fresh air, his clothes sticking to him. A few minutes late, the door opened and David collapsed into his mum's arms, wailing incoherently. David hadn’t ran back to the depot. David McGowan had ran home.

“Woah, woah, woah. back up. Fuck you mean ‘He just ran away’? He finds a body tied to a statue and has it away on his toes? For Christ sake!” Stevie Tyson wiped his mouth with the back of his hand as he stood up, his phone clamped to his ear. He motioned to the girl behind the counter and waved a £5 note at her and placed it on the table, next to his empty plate and made for the door. As he pushed the door open, the voice on the other end of the phone said something which clearly angered Tyson, making him swear and scare the 2 little old ladies who were going into the greasy spoon Tyson was just leaving. One stared, mouth open, while the other tutted at the back of the barrel chested DI. “I don’t care if he’s a bit simple. You find a body, you pick up the fucking phone and call 999, not bolt home to your fucking mum!! Have you told DS McCann yet?”...”No? Well, get on the blower to him, and tell him to meet me at the scene” Tyson thumbed the button to hang up and stuffed the phone back in his pocket as he stomped along the road towards his car. Taking his leather jacket off as he approached, he shook his head and blew out his cheeks… there are times when it seemed like people were trying to piss him off. His boss, his colleagues, his wife, his kids, the general public. Fucking everyone annoyed him. Even just thinking about it wound him up. He unplipped the locks, wrenched open the door, threw his jacket across to the passenger seat and climbed in, slamming the door behind him. A few moments and a wheel spin later and he was heading out the car park towards the centre of town.

Colin McCann was on his hands and knees, tugging furiously when the phone rang. He stood, took off his gardening gloves, aimed a frustrated kick at the stubborn weed as he crossed the garden towards the house. 
“Hello, Colin McCann. Can I help?” 
His smile slipped when he heard the voice of the station controller on the other end.
“Well, it is supposed to be my day off”
A phrase made him sag.
“Oh, DI Tyson..no, I haven’t spoke to him. I...” A sigh. “Ok, what’s the address?”
He juggled the phone to his ear, as he started to write. “You mean, the actual monument? Goodness me.Yes, I’ll just need to get changed and I’ll head in. Thanks. Bye.”
A large sigh whistled out of his nostrils, as he made his way upstairs to wash his hands.
 
""Be bloody careful"" barked Tyson. Several SOCO were trying, badly, to lower the body onto the waiting trolley below. Two were holding the left arm while another two were holding the right, as a final pair were supporting the legs. Tyson turned at the sound of a pair of shoes slapping against the marble ground of the shopping centre and groaned inwardly. DS McCann. In Tyson's eyes, a nice enough guy, a decent copper,but God, he was soft. Barely swore, didn't drink and was always the the first to disappear on a night out. But worst of all, he stuck to the rules. Tyson was of the school of hard knocks of policing. Punch first, then a sly kick to the ribs...then you asked questions. And if you didn't like the questions, you punched again. 
""Morning Boss! Terrible thing, eh?""
Tyson grunted.
""Any idea who he is?"" asked McCann, as the socos and a few of the medical team wrestled the body onto its back. 
""Donor wristband. Ian Thomas. 37. After we finish here, we will head to his place and break the news.” 
As they finally got the body into a position to close the large black bag, one of the medical team started to wave frantically towards Tyson, as another backed away from the body shaking their head. 
A grunt as he trudged forward. “Fuck is it now.” 
The chief paper suit wearer stepped forward as Tyson and McCann walked closer. “ Thought you might wanna see this.”. She stepped out of the way to allow them closer. The first thing that struck them was the smell.. a meaty tang, like raw chicken left in the sun. The bag was zipped up to the waist. Cause of death seemed to be obvious. The victim's throat was slit, almost from ear to ear, hence the dummy-like drooping. And as horrifying as that was, that wasn’t what the medical examiner had called them over for. Further down on the Ian Thomas’s chest, carved thick and deep was “1 3 0 8”. 
“Fuck sake” growled Tyson, as he stepped forward. “1308?” A glance toward McCann. “ Any idea?”
McCann puffed out his cheeks, as his eyes caught the statue. “Possibly a religious text? Is 1308 something to do with St Michael?”
The lead soco sniffed “Yeah, that's possible. We thought a date? Like,13th of August?” McCann shrugged at the suggestion. Tyson sighed loudly before spinning off and marching towards his car. “God almighty. Bloody killers and their cryptic nonsense! Just tell me why you're a knife wielding lunatic!” Tyson veered to a collection of three uniformed officers and handed out tasks. “Right, you - contact churches and the local university. Find out if the numbers have any religious significance, after that check those numbers and see if it's a date.” The first officer nodded and hurried off. “You” The second flinched. “Get onto control and find out about Ian Thomas.” A nod and high pitched “ Yes, Guv” as he ran off. Tyson turned on the last one. “And you “ The constable noticeably shrunk. Tyson pointed towards the crowd that was gathering at the end of high street, a few white local TV vans dotted at the back. “See that shower? Keep them back. We will have the ambulance going through soon and i don’t want those bastards snapping pictures. And I want nothing, and I mean NOTHING getting out about the numbers carved on the vic’s chest. Understand? Good. Now fuckin’ get a move on. McCann? With me”

As they drove towards Ian Thomas’s house, the sky above was a gunmetal grey. As far as the eye could see was taken up by what seemed to be a single dirty grey cloud. McCann was thinking about flicking on the lights as he drove. 
“Sir, this numbers thing? Do you think we will get much joy from it?”
Tyson, arms folded, opened his eyes slowly. “Dunno, maybe”
McCann again “The fact he has went to great lengths to tell us these numbers must be significant.”
A shuffle further down in his seat. “Mmmmunno. sh-maybe”
A third time. “Maybe it's not meant to be split up? One thousand, three hundred and eight?.”
Tyson had slumped against the door, chin almost bouncing off his chest, snoring gently. McCann sighed, and smiled grateful he didn't have to engage with the neanderthal. At times, he was just plain rude! And the way he spoke to those PC’s before was terrible, it’s like he was trying to scare them out of some daft perverse reason.

10 minutes later and they pulled up outside 16 Regents Avenue. A nice street, all Volvos and clipped hedges. The only sound was from Queenhill Primary School a few streets away. McCann was first out of the car, smoothing his suit and checking his shoes as he waited on Tyson to heave his groaning bulk out of the passenger seat. A body shuddering stretch and Tyson closed the car door, as he turned to face the house. Elbows resting on top of the car. “I always hate this fucking part. Do me a favour? You do the talking this time, and I’ll get the next one.”
McCann stared at him. “Sir, you’ve said that the last 3 times. And every time, you always say that you’ll get the next one.” 
“Aw fuck sake. Look, just….” Tyson tried to smile, an unnatural event that made McCann step back. “Just do this one and I’ll buy you a pint. Of fair trade orange juice, or whatever nonsense you drink.” 
“Fine! But it’s pineapple and grapefruit!” declared McCann.
It was Tysons turn to stare, before clumping slowly up the path. McCann overtook him and thumbed the bell, a faint ringing coming from with in. A moment or two later, and the door was opened sharply by a lady in her early thirties, checked shirt, hair tied back with a few strands escaping and framing her face, wiping her hands on her tea towel. She was scowling but it quickly turned into a pleasant smile.
Tyson stared open mouthed “Ju...Julie?”
She furrowed her brow “No, I’m Karen. I’m sorry, I thought you were my husband. Can I help?
McCann looked from Tyson to the lady before speaking slowly “Mrs Thomas? Your husband is Ian, is that correct?”
Her eyes darted between the two men. They didn't seem like friends, the thin man trying to smile. The other one, who had called her the wrong name, was looking up at the sky, swallowing. Starting to sweat.
“Yes, how do you know that? Who are you?”
“I’m Detective Sergeant McCann, this is Inspector Tyson. May we come in? It’s, I’m afraid it’s about Ian”
Her bottom lip started to go, as she stood aside to let McCann in. Tyson held back for a few seconds and with shaking legs walked inside.     

The Thomas’s living room was an advert for Kodak. Pictures everywhere. Ian and Karen's wedding, their son Callum with some football trophy, their daughter Becky in a tutu. Holiday snaps plastered all over one wall. Turkey, Spain, the kids with Mickey Mouse, Ian ‘holding’ up the tower of Pisa. Tyson, having regained his composure stood with his hands stuffed into his pockets, sighed and slowly turned round. McCann was still talking, trying to keep her from wailing again.
“Just a few more questions. We have a Victim support officer on their way. They will help you with anything you need.”   
“Oh God, Ian. My Ian. Who would hurt him? She looked at McCann. “What am I gonna tell the kids?” McCann struggled for words. Any words. His mouth just opened and closed. He glanced up at Tyson. Tyson stepped forward and knelt down, almost shaking as he took her hand. McCann knew he should intervene. About what was happening. Tyson dropped his voice “Ju...Karen..You know what you're gonna tell them. That their Dad was a hardworking man who loved his family very much. That they need to be strong. Like you're gonna be strong. For them. And I promise you..” McCann butted in. “Guv, I know there's a resemblance to…” Tyson snapped “Enough Sargeant!” Back to Karen Thomas. “I promise you, we will get to the bottom of this and find the bastard that killed your husband.” McCann groaned quietly. Tyson glared as he continued. “But we need your help. Is there anyone who could have done this? Did Ian have any enemies?” Karen shook her head, more strands of hair escaping. “What, no! Ian was so lovely, everyone loved him. God, what am I gonna tell his mum? Oh Ian…” Huge sobs racked Karen Thomas as she buried her face in the tea towel. A vibrating started in Tysons pocket moments before a shrill ringing. He fumbled it free as he stepped into the kitchen, McCann shuffling across on the sofa, his hand reaching for Karen's shoulder. Tyson closed door behind him, looked at the screen. It was one of PCs from before. He gritted his teeth and thumbed Answer. “This better be fucking good. I'm at the victim's house with his bloody widow.” he hissed down the phone. 
A voice squeaked at the other end. “Er, boss, it’s me. Erm, I mean PC Gibson”
“I know that, I can see it on my fucking screen” growled Tyson. “What. Is. It?”
“Oh, I, well, you told me to go to the Churches and Uni, but it doesn't seem to be religious but there is something on 13th of August”
Tyson waited.
“Hello, Sir? Are you there?”
“For Christ Sake, I’m not a mind reader, what is it?” 
“Oh, yes, it's the international left handed day”
Tyson leaned against the door and sighed ”Well I don't think it's lefities bumping off us righties, do you?” 
“I guess not, Sir,no.”
Tyson hung up, shook his head as he pushed back into the living room to find Karen Thomas alone. He was just about to berate McCann for leaving her alone, when he walked through from the hall with the Victim Support Officer, a small woman with a bowl haircut and a large smile. McCann knelt. “Karen, I'm very sorry. If you can think of anything, just call the station and they will put you through to me. We will leave you just now with…” He looked at the new comer. “Jane.” “Yes, Jane. She will help you.” He squeezed her shoulder as he stood. Tyson motioned towards the door to McCann and as he past whispered to the VSO.”We haven't been able to get anything out of her. When she calms down, find out her husband's routine. When he should have finished work, his route home, things like that and call me.” The VSO smiled, large cheeks expanding. “I'll do what I can, but I'm not sure I'll get much soon.” Tyson nodded as he and McCann said their goodbyes as they headed out the front door, Tyson exhaling loudly as the door closed. “Sir, what was the call about?” asked McCann, struggling to keep up with Tyson who was striding towards the car. 
“It was Gibson phoning from the university. It's not religious or a date unless our killer is a lunatic leftie. I'll go speak the my CHIS, see if anyone knows anything. So, we speed down there, find some telling piece of evidence, catch the psycho and tonight, I’ll buy you a gallon of Pear and Pomegranate or whatever the fuck it is” Tyson flashed a grin as he climbed into the car, leaving McCann to sigh “It’s pineapple and grapefruit…” 
Climbing in, McCann started the engine. “Where to, boss?”
Tyson, stroking the scar on his chest by poking a finger through the gaps in his shirt thought for a minute. Eventually, he said “Drop me off at the pub on Jacks Lane. Gonna give my CHIS a little shake, see if he knows anything. Something like this creates ripple. You get back to the station, avoid Higgins as much as you can, and start to write some of this shit up.” 
McCann nodded. Paperwork was his forte and he always preferred to stay out of the way of some of Tysons informers. 
“Do you really think anyone will know anything this early on? I mean, the fella is barely cold, guv”
Tyson sniffed. “This type of thing takes planning. And there must be some reason for it. You don't decide to carve someone up and hang them like a poor man's Jesus outside Debenhams for no reason. This lunatic will have been ranting to folk. Hopefully, to other lunatics or local scum”.
McCann wasn't so sure, but it kept him out of the way of Tyson and his gang of ragamuffins so he kept quiet and drove. Tyson pulled out his phone and dialled. 
“Baz, it's Tyson. Where are you? Excellent mate. Stay there. I'm on my way. I want a wee chat. See you soon.” He slipped the phone back in his pocket. “The Jesters. Head there.” 
McCann nodded. “Sure thing boss.”
Tyson leaned forward and clicked the radio on. 
“‘And your listening to me, Knox around the clocks, on Kingslake 1308. Coming next we have…”
Tyson yelled, McCann pointed at the radio making a shriek, the car coming to a shuddering halt.
“Boss, the radio. 1308!! It's the frequency!”
“How the fuck didn't we get that earlier? I listen to it every bloody day!” He pulled out his phone and and hammered away at the pad. “McCann, take us to the Kingslake fm station…,bloody 1308, Gibson? It's Tyson. The numbers are the frequency for Kingslake FM. Get on the blower to the station and tell them we are on our way. Call me back then it's done.” 
McCann had started the car and was still shaking his head. “I just don't understand how we missed it.”
Tyson dialled the station again. “Kennedy, it's DI Tyson. When you're looking into Ian Thomas, check to see if there is a connection with the local radio station.” Almost as soon as he hung up, it rang again. “Hello?”
“Boss, it's Gibson.”
“Go on.”
“Oh, well. I'm just off the phone with the radio station and I think you'll wanna go down there. Apparently, last night they received a threat that if they didn't let some guy talk on air, he'd kill someone. The DJ at the time, a Matthew newman, brushed it off as a crank.”
Tyson looked at McCann, grinning.
“Oh, did he know?”
Kennedy again “The producer at the time, Adrian Walker, was thinking of phoning us today because he felt so, and I quote “tripped out by it”.”
Kennedy could hear the smile in Tysons voice.
“Call him back, tell him we are on our way.”
He thumbed the phone and slid it back into his inside pocket.
McCann was looking between Tyson and the road.
“Well?”
Tyson grinned. 
“Last night, the DJ refused to let some caller on air who threatened to kill someone. And today, we got a dead body with their name all over it. Kingslake Station. Let's have a word with these morons.”

55elxd,3,2016-10-01,Me [20 M] with my issue of dating others and being ashamed of my home,throwaway523r542,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/55elxd/me_20_m_with_my_issue_of_dating_others_and_being/,"So I'm approaching 21 soon and I've still yet to have an actual girlfriend. I wouldn't say I'm desperate for one but I'm starting feel pressured with pretty much all my friends having one and third wheeling a lot.  

Here is where the being ashamed of my home part comes in. So my family is lower middle class, probably even lower and my house is well a dump, with old cigarette stained walls, half renovated rooms and just falling apart in general. I know for a fact that these issues won't be addressed by my parents.    

I'm very ashamed of my house as everyone I know has very nice houses and hence I never let anyone come over.  

This is my issue: It just doesn't seem realistic to have a girlfriend if I'm not willing to let them come to my house, in a way not letting them be in a part of my life.  

Some may say move out but I'm a university student at the moment with a part time job with minimum hours. I don't think I can afford to move out while studying and I don't think I'll be able to hold my job after I start the required work experience which is essentially a full time internship (for a period of time with increasing duration over the next few years) as part of the course.  I still have 3 more years until I graduate due to my stupidity.  

I also lack a lot of privacy as I don't have a room so I can't have really have private calls or have someone over without someone else being in the room or within earshot.   

So reddit what should I do?  
Just give up on dating until I graduate and move out? Or am I just being stupid.

  **tl;dr**: Ashamed of my house and letting that affect my dating life."

55flas,8,2016-10-01,Big 4 Interview Tips,Blinkme1011,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/55flas/big_4_interview_tips/,"Hey guys,

So I recently landed an on campus online interview for an internship position with one of the Big 4 firms for Thursday of next week. I am incredibly excited for this opportunity as I have wanted to work for one of the Big 4 companies for quite some time. With all this excitement comes a lot of nerves as I have never interviewed with any of the Big 4 companies before. I am currently a Senior, majoring in accounting, with my mind set on taking a 5th year to acquire my Masters Degree in order to reach the 150 credits needed to attain my CPA. I am interviewing for the Tax internship position. I am very nervous about this interview seeing as my GPA is a little low in the eyes of the Big 4 (I have a 3.2), so I know I most likely need to knock this interview out of the park. I have a brother who is a Tax Manager at one of the offices with the company that I am interviewing for and he has given me some guidance on the whole situation, but I would like to get some outside advice from you knowledgeable people!

Are there any staple questions that are asked by the Big 4 that I should be prepared for? Are there any Do's or Don'ts that I should be made aware of? What can I mention that would impress the interviewer? Any information/guidance would be much appreciated! Thank you!!"
55fxzf,39,2016-10-01,#UnderTheSheet theory?,directtoanne,htgawm,https://www.reddit.com/r/htgawm/comments/55fxzf/underthesheet_theory/,"Fan theory: it's Asher. 

Why do I think it's Asher and not anyone else? Let's list out the possible contenders here:

Nate, Bonnie, Frank, Connor, Wes, Laurel, Michaela, Asher, Eve, Meggy, and that weird rude dude from the clinic that everyone hates. Let's call him A. 

Let's rule out the simple ones. 

Meggy, and A are out of the question from the start. The over the top reaction Annalise gave must be valid for whoever is killed, otherwise the cops would suspect that it was faked. 

A is a student of hers that qualified for the clinic but is definitely not close to her otherwise. And there's no chance of him getting close to her in the future because Annalise doesn't let people in very easily and especially not a student (apart from those who intern for her, of course). 

Meggy, you could argue, may get close to over the next 13 episodes. However, I took into account the following factor:

In interviews, both the actors playing Michaela and Oliver stated the death was ""heartbreaking"". Meggy is unquestionably at least partially disliked by all of us viewers, and A is also not a fan favourite, so I doubt the deaths of either of them would break our hearts anytime soon. 

For the remaining 9, you'd have to admit the death of any one of them would be reasonably heartbreaking, so let me level it out. 

I doubt Michaela is going. Firstly, Michaela's character is one, like Wes, that just hasn't quite yet hit the mark. Connor has hit our sweet spot, Asher is one who has matured greatly, and Laurel we are all fiercely proud of. Wes just kind of exists and rolls with the punches and Michaela, like him, floats, occasionally landing a few punches but not yet scoring that touch down like the other three. Michaela still has a lot, lot more character development to make, and that is why it's unlikely that she will leave. 

I definitely do not think it's Bonnie either, quite ironically, for the exact opposite of Michaela's reasons. Bonnie had an entire, fully fleshed character arc in season 2 that spanned a personal abuse story and really gave us strong insight into her foundations and her deep rooted loyalty in Annalise. There is no way in hell that they just spent hours of screentime on Bonnie just to kill her off next season. The season after that, maybe. But the very next? That's just bad timing. 

I'm going to rule out Wes as well, simply because that is ridiculous. To have Wes behind another reveal wouldn't be a surprise at all, it would just be clichéd and overdone at this point. That's not even to mention the fact that Wes is the sticky, messy glue holding the Keating 5 together, and technically, from a very very technical season 1 standpoint, he sort-of is/was the main character? You can't play the Keating 5 without Wes and his withdrawn, casual-meltdown-yet-insisting-everything-is-fine self. 

I don't think it's Eve either, simply because it wouldn't be pulling all the hard punches. For something to be completely heartbreaking, you'd need to pull out the material from episode 1, but according to Nowalk's interview she only comes back for one episode, so it is hella unlikely that it's her. 

Now Laurel seems like a very big contender in the might-be-dead box, but thinking about it logically, Laurel has too much going for her this season. She is a fan favourite, and this season she has a whole story arc with her dad, she's getting closer to Bonnie and Annalise by helping them find Frank, and there's that big Laurel/Wes chemistry they have yet to fully experiment with. There is no way they'd kill her off now. Finding a character the people love is hard - they would not waste that on a mind blowing cliffhanger no matter how mind blowing.

Frank is another fun possibility to consider. But I'm going to shut down this one pretty quick: there still isn't a closed case on Lila's death, and we would need Frank alive to play that one out. There's no way that they would close that case and seal all the gaps within the next 13 episodes while keeping up with the Mahoney case and everything else going on. 

That leaves 3 people. Asher, Connor and Nate. At this point, it's all just guesswork. 

Connor is going nowhere. I say this out of pure blind faith and without any solid evidence because I believe that Pete Nowalk of all people would not kill off another gay person on television just for shock factor. The television LGBT death toll has just gotten way too high (the 100, anyone?), and I will not fathom even the slightest chance that Connor is leaving, even though admittedly, it does check the box of ""heartbreaking"", pretty darn strongly.

Nate, I also have zero evidence for. What I'm banking on here is Ricamora's interview, where he states the reveal is ""unexpected"" and that the character is ""pivotal"" to the show. Nate's death? Heartbreaking? Yes. Unexpected? Not really. Is Nate pivotal? Well,,, as much as I love those gorgeous muscles, when you compare his role to the rest,,, not really. That's literally all I'm banking on when I eliminate Nate from this lineup. 

Which leaves us with Asher. Heartbreaking? Check. Unexpected? Check. His character pivotal? Check. The other reason why I feel like Asher is the guy to go is because unlike Michaela and Wes, he's gone through distinctive and obvious character development to go from point A to point B, but unlike Bonnie, it didn't eat up much screentime for it to be a big waste if the character were killed off. Additionally, unlike Laurel, there aren't many more place for Asher to touch on. They have covered his family, his romantic life, and his personality. There isn't much more for him to do so much as be the comedy of the group. Yes, I do think this season, Asher will undergo even more character development. Asher has his whole romance with Michaela and his issue with money, and his newfound acceptance and comfort in the Keating 5. What I believe is going to happen, is this:

Asher is going to mature a hell of a lot. Asher will step up, earn some money the hard way in order to stay in the game and pay off his tuition. Finally, when he does, Michaela will somehow see he has grown up - and is no longer a meat stick. Right after that happens, Asher dies. It's sad and dramatic but it's also the perfectly at the peak of Asher's development.

That's also why the rude dude at the clinic exists. He's gg to be the new guy in the Keating 5 next season. Sooner or later he will kill someone and join the murder club, and I'm 99‰ sure we will end up loving him somehow.

Asher is the perfect guy to go because we love him enough for it to be heartbreaking, but he's not a fan favourite like Laurel where we would flip shit if he left. He's pivotal enough to pack a sizeable punch in the Keating 5, and definitely will shake things up for future seasons."

I graduate this spring with a BS in computer engineering and I am going to apply for NASA's Recent Graduate Program.  I have some questions and I wanted to clear some things up.  

1.  What GS rank would I likely be as a recent graduate?  I've heard everything from GS-6 to GS-9.
2.  How are promotions usually handled?  At what rate are engineers usually promoted?  I heard that engineers are typically promoted two ranks at a time until GS-13, but I have not found any documentation to confirm this information.

Thank you in advance."

Due what?"": Goldman hires Libyan fund manager's kid brother, wines and dines kid with $300 whore at Ritz-Carlton, sells €2.4 billion in derivatives to Libyans ""who live in the middle of the desert with their camels"", market crashes, Libya loses $1.2 billion, threatens &amp; sues Goldman",ydtm,btc,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/55g4cr/due_diligence_due_what_goldman_hires_libyan_fund/,"http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-goldman-sachs-libya/

**Hot Mess: How Goldman Sachs Lost $1.2 Billion of Libya’s Money**

**When Wall Street’s most aggressive bank took on the world’s most incendiary client, someone was going to make a killing.**

In 2008, in ""one of the biggest orders that GS has ever been given on single names"", Goldman Sachs sold €2.4 billion in derivatives to Libya.

- Goldman was represented by its sales VP: Moroccan Youssef Kabbaj

- Qaddafi's Libyan Investment Authority was represented by its deputy chief executive: Mustafa Zarti, a Qaddafi family friend 

- A manager at Goldman told a colleague he’d ""just delivered a pitch on structured leveraged loans to **someone who lives in the middle of the desert with his camels.**""

The rest is history - and recommended weekend reading if you're into a 6,000-word chronicle of shady bankers and gullible Libyans placing risky derivatives bets using oil money:

- Libya's Mustafa Zerti gets Goldman to hire his kid brother Haitem Zerti hired as an intern (despite that fact that **the kid got his MBA from the Vienna campus of a St. Louis-based diploma mill and he worked at a video rental store**)

- Libya fund manager's kid brother gets wined and dined at the Ritz-Carlton in Morocco, **Libyan kid enjoys the pleasures of a $300 whore on Goldman expense**, 

- That same day, Libya buys €2.4 billion in derivatives - **""one of the biggest orders that GS has ever been given on single names""**

- The financial markets crash in 2008

- Libya loses $1.2 billion, Goldman makes over $200 million on deal

- Goldman's sales rep Kabbaj has to quietly flee Libya after a meeting where the **Libyan fund manager Zerti threatened Kabbaj and his family**

- Libya is now suing Goldman for $1.2 billion - using a novel argument of ""undue influence"" (more commonly used by wives against husbands - never used in financial litigation before)

- A win for Libya would **overturn the ""bedrock principle of the securities business: that sophisticated investors can look out for themselves and don’t have recourse to the courts if they lose their shirts""**

- **""If a huge sovereign wealth fund can successfully claim it was duped, there’s no telling who else can.""**

55gsjk,2,2016-10-02,F4M Some fun scenes!,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/55gsjk/f4m_some_fun_scenes/,"Hey there DPP, tonight I have a couple scenes for you all to choose from and/or work out with me!

We can discuss specific prompts in private and please, do not message me with a scene already started, that’s the easiest way to get blocked. The same goes for one line/word messages.

I'm fairly open with my kinks with my only hard ""no""s being scat, unrealistically huge cocks, 3rd person writing, and vomit.

Without further ado, here are some of my prompts:

**The Lawyer and the Con**: For this one, I was thinking I’d play a young and up and coming lawyer tasked with defending you. We can discuss the specifics in PMs but one thing is for certain, I’ll be taking my payment in the form of cock.

**Breaking the Law**: For this one, the roles are reversed, I was caught committing a crime and you’re the officer/journalist/detective who caught me. Where that leads? Well that’s up to you.

**Wrong neighborhood**: What happens when me, a young and sexy girl finds herself in the wrong neighborhood? Do you help me find my way or decide you want to take advantage?

**Sports Star and Reporter**: A classic scene were I’m a reporter and you’re the sports star, that can only lead one place, right?

**The intern and the boss**: Fairly self explanatory, I’d love to be the intern at her dream job who meets you, her boss and potentially so much more.

**Opposite Sides**: For this one, I want to play a FBI/CIA/DEA Agent who is tasked with infiltrating your organization, now what that organization does we can discuss in PMs but I basically want you to turn me from righteous agent of the law into your slut.

**I’m gonna fuck your sister**: For this one, you’ll play my little brother’s best friend, I’ll be his big sister who is now recently single and back in town. You guys always joked that you would fuck each other’s mom/sister only this time, you’re not joking.

**Giving back**: In this RP, I’ll play someone  famous be it an actress or singer or sports star. You’ll be the person tasked in helping me set up some sort of event to give back to the community, only you want me to give you something more than this event.

**Bullies always win**: In this one, you’ll be as the title suggests, you’re a bully who grew up terrorizing my son (or brother), only unlike the stories we tell our kids to make them feel better, you know better. You get what you want, when you want it, in this case, me.

For those of you so inclined, I do like playing celebs in any of these roles so we have visual aids, if you’d like me to be any, just ask!

As for celebs I’d play, here are a few, feel free to ask about ones not listed:

Celebs: **Mary Elizabeth Winstead**, **Maisie Williams**, Anna Kendrick, Selena Gomez, Hailee Steinfeld, Taylor Swift, Willa Holland, Daisy Ridley, **Melissa Benoist**, Emma Stone/Watson/Roberts, Hayley Williams, Alison Brie, Alexandra Daddario, Aubrey Plaza, Bella Thorne, **Alicia Vikander** Jennifer Lawrence, Keri Russel, Neve Campbell, Jennifer Connelly, Scarlet Johansson, Sophie Turner, Oliva Munn, Olivia Wilde, **Miranda Kerr**, Jessica Biel/Alba, Victoria Justice

YouTube/Social Media: **Meg Turney**, Lia Marie Johnson, **Alli Speed**, Barbara Dunkelman, Ashley Jenkins, **Bree Essrig**, Maude Garrett, Trisha Hershberger, Datev Gallagher, Lindsey Stirling, Christina Grimme, Dodger, iJustine, or Meghan Camarena.

Whew, that was a lot. Hope to get some dirty orangereds soon!

Just so we're clear, everyone I'm playing in this post is 18+, so the prompts would take place in the future."
55hft9,1,2016-10-02,Norman has a bad day,Spokersweep,lifeofnorman,https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/55hft9/norman_has_a_bad_day/,"Felecia went about her normal day. She cooked her husband and son breakfast, left some dry cat food in the bowl by the pantry, and left for work. She was working when one of her interns came up to her and inquired about her family. The conversation went as follows:

“Hello Felecia, how are you doing today?”  The young intern asked this with a sly smile on his lips. He has been flirting with her for nearly 3 months now and today was the day he planned to make his move.

“I’m doing quite well, Jonathan.  And yourself?”  She asked this while rolling her shoulders back, pushing her chest out slightly. 

The smile on Jonathan’s face widened. “I’m doing great, thank you for asking. I came here to ask about your husband. The late nights you’ve been working lately, is that because of him?” Jonathan knew his boldness might be his undoing, but he grew weary of the subtlety he has had to apply these recent weeks. His internship was almost up, and he decided now was his chance. 

“You’ve noticed have you? Yes, Norman has been difficult lately. Also Norman junior is failing college and wants to move to Hollywood to become an actor. I just wish I had someone I could speak to about all of this, I have plenty I need to get off my chest.”

Jonathan knew that this was his moment to shine. “Oh goodness, I’m so sorry to hear about that. If there is anything I can do to help you, please let me know. And I mean anything.” Jonathan put his hand on her knee. 

Felecia smiled. 


Norman sat in his chair with Norman on his lap. He held a letter in his hand. Silently Norman wept as he finished reading the letter. Norman Junior had just packed up his bags and left for Hollywood and his wife left a letter for him explaining her new boyfriend and how young and beautiful he was, and how Norman was not. 

“At least one thing in my life won’t leave me.” Norman said as he pet Norman’s back. Norman purred. 



Hey all, first time poster. I found this randomly and read the rules and was inspired, I guess. Felt like naming his son Norman as well. Seemed appropriate."
55hfu9,3,2016-10-02,I'm a 23 year old dude who hasn't ever had a real relationship and needs help.,GimmeMahLulz,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/55hfu9/im_a_23_year_old_dude_who_hasnt_ever_had_a_real/,"I wanted to make this quick, but I don't really know how to summarize my situation so buckle in.

When growing up I was pretty awkward guy with terrible self esteem, the closest I ever came to a relationship was a crush on some chick in highschool. After that I started going to college, but because it was waaaaay cheaper elected to stay with my parents. Living at home + my lower self esteem (though I did start working on that) + the amount of time I had to devote to studying sorta made my rationalize my position as ""it can wait, I've got more important shit todo"", ""I can't bring people to 'my' house, that would be weird"", ""I'm still young"", etc. and I never ended up perusing a relationship nor really developing my social skills. When I got close to graduation (after doing a few full-time internships) I kinda figured out that I don't wanna program for a living, so I started perusing a pilot slot in the navy. 

So at this point I'm out of school, but since my current working situation is temporary, I'm *still* living with my parents. If everything works out for me, I'll be moving across the country to Florida in like 4-5 months, this leaves me in a tough pickle that's got me thinking that ""it's either going to be impossible or not sustainable to find a relationship now so it's not worth it"". This has resulted in my days being pretty much just job, gym, and videogames, which I'm ok with If I actually had, you know, someone to share my life with. 

I don't really know what to do anymore and am coming to you guys for some prodding. Cause at this point, most people my age have already fucked and almost all have been in many, many relationships, so I'm starting to feel more and more like I massively fucked my life up. I *don't want* to be alone like this and I *don't want* to keep putting this off I just really don't know where to start. 

Honestly, I think that my biggest fear is getting out of the navy in like 8 years and still being this alone.

I'm posting this super late at night, so I'm gonna go to sleep now (probably not the best time to post when looking for help lol) so I wont be able to reply right away. Sorry about that."
55hpeu,0,2016-10-02,"Me [26F] with the guy I'm dating [23M], after we had sex he went home and I'm not sure how to feel about it.",moonsafari_,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/55hpeu/me_26f_with_the_guy_im_dating_23m_after_we_had/,"Hello everyone.
So I've started going out with this guy I met online last week, after chatting for a few days. It seemed like we really fit together, have exactly the same tastes in music, films, books, tv shows, and the conversation was flowing really easily. He asked me out and we met up last Sunday for drinks. He lives about 50 minutes away from where I live, so he purposefully went for a place around my area. After drinks he walked me home (I thought that was very nice of him!) and he kissed me in front of my door. We had a really nice first date, and after we parted ways he texted me to say he'd had a great time (so did I).

He's just started an internship at a big investment bank, so told me he would be very busy, but said we could meet up later in the week, especially as the first week is training but later they would work him really hard, many nights up until 2AM. Sure enough, he texted me on Wednesday night asking if I wanted to meet up either on Wednesday night or on Thursday. I couldn't on Wed so we went for dinner on Thurs and then I took him on a very nice, long stroll along the river (he's new to the city). Before parting, we made out a bit and he said we could maybe meet up during the weekend.

I was a bit disappointed to see that during the week he only messaged me to see if I wanted to go out even though every time we messaged each other then we started talking a lot. Also, I went on the website we met on and found he was online (I had stopped going) and felt a bit sad. Don't get me wrong, I know we were just seeing each other and nothing serious was going on, still it can be quite disappointing to see that a guy you're dating and that you like a lot is still looking for other people...

Well he messaged me on Saturday afternoon asking me if I'd got plans for the night, and told him I was just lazing around, so invited him over to watch a film. We watched a good film, talked, made out and then had sex. He seemed a bit self conscious during sex (asked if I liked the positions, then apologised for coming before me), but I quite liked it. No cuddling afterwards (I gave him a kiss on the cheek and put my arm on his chest, to which he didn't respond).

After a while, he said he was going to call UBER and go home. It was 1AM, so I told him I didn't mind if he stayed, but he insisted, apologising. He said ""I don't want you to think that this is just sex, but I get up really early, I've got my habits..."" etc. I didn't insist. He kept saying ""I hope you're not mad"" and asking me ""are you mad? are you sure?"" to which I said ""Dude, it's fine, feel free to go home..."". We stayed talking for another hour or so while in bed, and then he called uber. I walked him out, and before leaving he said ""see you later, probably next weekend, because during the week I'll be working like crazy... Unless you want to meet at 2AM"".

I've never had one night stands before and I'm not sure this is one, but I'm really surprised by the feelings of rejection I'm experiencing since last night. I only had two boyfriends before, never waited too long for sex, but this is the first time someone leaves. Though I'd like to give him the benefit of the doubt, It's Sunday morning here and he hasn't texted me at all. I go on the dating website and - he's online! I guess I wouldn't have minded if he'd gone home but then reassured me after he left with either a call or a text while he was in the taxi or this morning, but this silence is kind of freaking me out. Not sure if I should stop hoping this is going to lead somewhere, we had so many good conversations and it looked like he was looking for something more than just sex (it was me who invited him over to ""watch a movie"")...

Any thoughts?
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I had sex with a guy I've been seeing for a week (we had three dates). We talked a lot, walked together and thought things were going well, but after sex he went home (last night), and I haven't heard from him."

55ilns,0,2016-10-02,[Employment] Am I in a position to ask for a raise?,oth_radar,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/55ilns/employment_am_i_in_a_position_to_ask_for_a_raise/,"I'm a software developer for a major software company in the States. I've been an intern there for a year, and I've worked there full time as an employee for another 4 months. My current title is ""associate software developer"" because I'm a new hire, and it's the entry level position I applied for.

With that said, I've been getting ramped up very quickly around the office. I am already the lead or a contributor on a few different projects, one of which is said to be the highest priority project for an upcoming release. The level of responsibility I have is now on par with most other developers at the company, and I routinely have conversations with many lead engineers in which I am providing good input. I have had 2 years of experience prior to this job as a web developer and I have a bachelor's degree in computer science.

Right now I'm making about $86,000 a year with benefits, $0 bonus, and maxing out my retirement account. I  did a quick search for what developer pay should be in my area given my level of education, years of experience, and so on, and the numbers I got were $98,000 for salary with a $6,000 bonus. 86,000 doesn't even seem to compare with 104,000, and i feel like it wouldn't be wrong of me to increase that number.

My inhibitions are that I've only been working for the company officially full time for 4 months. I feel like asking for a raise now, while justified based on my level of work and rising status, is a little early. I don't want to be seen as the ""entitled millennial"" at work because I asked for a raise too quickly, and hurt my chances at getting one in the future.

So, TL;DR : Am I in a position to ask for a raise, and if so, how much is it reasonable to ask for?

**Edit:** I casually brought up the question of fiscal review and when salaries get adjusted to my boss yesterday after giving a demo to my VP. He mentioned that the adjustments are in March, and I could assure myself I'm definitely getting a raise. Thanks everyone for your solid advice!"
55j2jy,1,2016-10-02,M4F Sunday Funday at DPP Casino,BreakFromReality,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/55j2jy/m4f_sunday_funday_at_dpp_casino/,"Hi there, and welcome to DPP Casino! I'm your host, BreakFromReality, and I'll be accompanying you in your journey to find a fun, erotic roleplay.

Please check your ID with the security guard -- all potential RP partners and their characters MUST be at least 18.

So now that you're here, how do you get started?

First, you'll sit down at our [single-deck blackjack table](https://www.random.org/playing-cards/), where you'll be deciding the kinks of the RP. You'll be dealt eight starting hands of blackjack, with each total matching up with a specific kink. (For example, a 20 is for cheating.)

Here's the full list of kinks:

* 4 -- Dealer's Choice
* 5 -- Light Bondage
* 6 -- Group Sex (MFMF, MFMFMF)
* 7 -- MFM Threesome
* 8 -- FFM Threesome
* 9 -- Interracial/Raceplay
* 10 -- Anal (Woman Receiving)
* 11 -- Filmed
* 12 -- Clothed Sex
* 13 -- Dirty Talk/Name-Calling
* 14 -- Rough Sex (Hair-Pulling, Spanking, Light Choking, etc.)
* 15 -- Public Sex
* 16 -- Creampie/Risk of Impregnation
* 17 -- Facial
* 18 -- Risk of Getting Caught (i.e. ""hold the moan"")
* 19 -- Uniform/Costume
* 20 -- Cheating
* 21 -- Player's Choice

Once eight unique hands are drawn, you will choose two kinks that you would like to include in the RP. You will also eliminate two other kinks that you would not like to include. The dealer will then choose two kinks of the remaining four.

The Dealer's Choice and Player's Choice can not be excluded.

*(To play: draw 2 cards from 1 shuffled deck. Make sure all cards except jokers are included. Repeat this eight times until complete.)*

Once the kinks are decided, you'll decide if you want to stay on the main casino floor or head over to The Den. *(While I will absolutely play with everyone, those choosing to go to The Den will get VIP status.)*

If you choose the main floor, you will head to our [roulette wheel](https://www.random.org/sequences/), where you'll help decide the character you'll be playing. The women listed on the wheel will be character models only (with one exception).

The list is as follows:

* 0 -- Player's Choice of Anyone on the List
* 1 -- You, because you're always #1 at DPP Casino!
* 2 -- Bella Thorne
* 3 -- Dove Cameron
* 4 -- Laurel Coppock
* 5 -- Alison Brie
* 6 -- Kendall Jenner
* 7 -- Candice Patton
* 8 -- Margot Robbie
* 9 -- Vanessa Hudgens
* 10 -- Scarlett Johansson
* 11 -- Taylor Swift
* 12 -- Miley Cyrus
* 13 -- Ariana Grande
* 14 -- Emma Stone
* 15 -- Milana Vayntrub
* 16 -- Nina Dobrev
* 17 -- Rihanna
* 18 -- Sarah Hyland
* 19 -- Lily Aldridge
* 20 -- Mila Kunis
* 21 -- Stella Maxwell
* 22 -- Dianna Agron
* 23 -- Chloe Grace Moretz
* 24 -- Katherine McNamara
* 25 -- Victoria Justice
* 26 -- Carrie Underwood
* 27 -- Jennifer Lawrence
* 28 -- Selena Gomez
* 29 -- Emilia Clarke
* 30 -- Emily Ratajkowski
* 31 -- Meghan Markle
* 32 -- Jourdan Dunn
* 33 -- Katy Perry
* 34 -- Aubrey Plaza
* 35 -- Nicole Beharie
* 36 -- Ariel Winter

You will spin the wheel six times (12 for two-female scenes and 18 for three-female scenes). You will then pick three characters (six for two-female scenes and nine for three-female scenes). The dealer will then choose the character he would like you to play (the Player's Choice may get excluded).

*(To play: Set the smallest value at 0 and the largest value at 36, and keep it in one column. Take the first 6/12/18 numbers in the list.)*

Finally, it's time to ""role"" the dice at the [craps table](https://www.random.org/dice/) and see just what you'll be playing. The roles are below:

* 2 -- Dealer's Choice
* 3 -- Coach's Daughter
* 4 -- Friend's Wife/Girlfriend
* 5 -- Student
* 6 -- Sister's/Daughter's Friend
* 7 -- Incest (Daughter, Sister, Cousin)
* 8 -- Friend's Sister/Daughter
* 9 -- Work Scenario (Secretary, Intern, Co-Worker, etc.)
* 10 -- Wife's/Girlfriend's Friend
* 11 -- Bully's/Bullying Victim's Sister
* 12 -- Player's Choice

*(If Celebrity is chosen, you will be playing the actual celebrity from the wheel instead of a lookalike. For 12, I am giving the option of playing either the bullying victim's sister or an interesting revenge plot with the bully's sister.)*

You will roll the dice four times. Of the four unique roles, you will then discard one. The dealer will discard one of the remaining three, and you will then choose one (or both, if possible) of the remaining two.

*(To play: simply roll two virtual dice. Repeat until four different roles are picked.)*

After that is done, we will have the RP with the characters, roles and kinks!

Now if you choose The Den?

Here's the list of characters for the roulette wheel:

* 0 -- Player's Choice of Anyone on the List
* 1 -- You, as a woman age 40+ (if you're not one already)
* 2 -- Rena Sofer
* 3 -- Nigella Lawson
* 4 -- Christie Brinkley
* 5 -- Eva Longoria
* 6 -- Rashida Jones
* 7 -- Jane Seymour
* 8 -- Elizabeth Hurley
* 9 -- Jennifer Lopez
* 10 -- Julianna Margulies
* 11 -- Patricia Heaton
* 12 -- Cheryl Hines
* 13 -- Jordan Ladd
* 14 -- Jennifer Aniston
* 15 -- Giada de Laurentiis
* 16 -- Julie Bowen

* 31 -- Kim Cattrall
* 32 -- Ellen Barkin
* 33 -- Sharon Stone
* 34 -- Paula Patton
* 35 -- Mary Steenburgen
* 36 -- Courteney Cox

And here are the roles:

* 3 -- Coach's Wife
* 4 -- Friend's Wife
* 5 -- Teacher/Principal
* 6 -- Mom's Friend
* 7 -- Incest (Mom, Aunt, Grandmother)
* 8 -- Friend's Mom
* 9 -- Work Scenario (Boss, Co-Worker, etc.)
* 10 -- Wife's Friend
* 11 -- Bully's/Bullying Victim's Mom
* 12 -- Player's Choice

That does it for our tour! We can't wait to play with you, and we know you'll have a good time; others have! 

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. And from all of us at DPP Casino, have a winning day!"

**June 2015:** She is always coming over to my desk to talk and seems very flirty. We become close and start going out to lunch with her and a few other interns everyday.

**July 2015:** She brings up her boyfriend which I didn't know she had. I start really falling for her and actually enjoy coming to work just because I got to spend the whole day with her.

**August 2015:** Internship ends and we go our separate ways (different colleges about 45 mins apart). She is still dating her bf at this point

**September 2015:** She texts me out of the blue and we start texting a lot. 

**October 2015:** We are still texting but it's less often. She never talked about her boyfriend so not sure if they were together. I ask her to hang out sometime and she has a legitimate excuse as to why she can't. I tell her that's fine and to just let me know when she's free.

**November 2015**: I met a different girl and we get into a relationship

**December 2015**: I graduate college and move to Houston.

**Janruary 2016**: She texts me randomly. We text for a little.

**February 2016**:

**March 2016**: She texts me to see where I'm working.

**April 2016**:

**May 2016**: She graduates college. We both attend the same wedding of a fellow intern. So we only knew the bride and each other. I bring my girlfriend and she brings no one. I find out her and the boyfriend broke up (not sure when)

**June 2016**: Me and my girlfriend break up.

**July 2016**: She moves to Houston as well. I text her and we talk for a little bit.

**August 2016**: She invites me to out with her and her friends. So this was the first time we hung out as both single people. She seemed flirty but nothing happened.

**September 2016**: We hang out a few more times in group settings.

**Today:** I confess to her that I like her and that I'd love to take her out sometime. She says that her and this guy had the talk about ""not seeing other people"", but that she has had ""so much fun hanging out with me and she's looking forward to more fun times in Houston!"" She had only mentioned this guy once and I knew she was single as of two weeks ago so I didn't think things were serious at all.

That rejection REALLY hurt me. I mean never cry but I cried for a good while after that. I mean I really like this girl, but I guess at least I know she doesn't like me and I won't have to keep wondering. But I am curious as to where I went wrong? Or if it was a lost cause from the beginning?

Also, not sure I want to ever see her again TBH. She is a good friend but it will be too hard seeing her with another guy.

Posting on a throwaway, because people know my other Reddit account name. I am the beneficiary of someone who recently passed away. I will be receiving around 100k (USD), and there are options for how I can receive the money.

I can receive it as a lump sum payment, receive it as a shortened annuity over the next 5 or 10 yrs, or receive it as a annuity for the rest of my life. Right now I'm completely disregarding the annuity option over the rest of my life, as it won't really do much over my lifetime. So I'm between choosing the lump sum or the 5/10 yr annuity.

As I see it, the lump sum will be taxed for this year while the 5/10 yr annuity will be a bit greater of a sum at the end, but will be taxed at my tax rate over the next couple years. That's where my dilemma comes into play. I'll be earning around 80-90k over the next 5-10 yrs (factoring in salary increases). And this year, I've earned less than 10k from an internship.

My worry is that the extra cash over the next 5/10 years will be taxed at a higher bracket than it would be if I just took a lump sum for this tax year.

The money, no matter what method I use, would most likely be put in the bank and would later be used as a down payment on a home. Thank you for any help you can provide and please let me know if there's anything else you would need to know."

This came to me whilst reading Robert Greene's *50th Law*, which I highly recommend.

Everyone wants a clear roadmap, a hero to model and a leader to follow. He who yearns for freedom, power and riches is he who yearns most for direction and clarity. Yet it is he who is bold enough to pioneer a way forward for others -- to become a leader in a leaderless time -- who will actually achieve these ends. Be the leader everyone is searching for, give the orders everyone is dying to follow.

As a finance student, the industry I will enter in just a few years is extremely rigid and stiff. It must be reformed and revolutionized. I am actively searching for fields in finance that are most innovative and novel. My plan is to be at the cutting edge of these fields and dominate that space. The first glaring candidate is fintech, specifically blockchain. While my classmates are applying for internships at the big banks like J.P. or Goldman, who have representatives on campus urging students to apply. That's the thing to do around here. I think the real thing to do is that which is the opposite of the popular ""thing to do.""

I will focus on being flexible and dynamic as much as possible, understanding and learning the new edges of the industry as they are pioneered. I will be just ahead of the curve to dominate the space and eventually profit handsomely off of my efforts. I will be the leader trailblazing the way for others to follow."
55kf4m,1,2016-10-02,Lived Experience of a Crisis Intervention Clinican,sshowalter,mystory,https://www.reddit.com/r/mystory/comments/55kf4m/lived_experience_of_a_crisis_intervention_clinican/,"If you would have told me that I would become a crisis intervention counselor on the day I graduated high school in 2008, I would have laughed in your face or at least gawked at the idea. Back in 2008, my greatest aspirations were to go into the ministry or become a famous author. As with most teenage dreams, these did not come to fruition. Well, let me take that back, I did serve a year as a youth ministry intern and I did try to publish a journal but I digress. I want to take a moment and just reflect on my past and some of the things I've learned along the way.


Personal Background History


I grew up in a small country town in Northwest, MO. Most of the residents from my home town would probably not refer to themselves as ""country"" but now that I live in a big city, it's the best adjective I've got. I was in 4-H, raised cattle in my family's backyard and had 32 kids in my graduating class. While 32 sounds like a small number, my hometown prided itself on being one of the largest towns in the area. So there's that.


What my hometown had in home-grown, down-to-earth morality it lacked in diversity. In fact, I don't think I had met anyone that was not my same race until I was 15 or 16. Socially, I describe my experience as being in a shark tank; you either fit in or you were a social outcast. I, unfortunately, fell into the latter. It seemed no matter what I did, I was not good enough. I recall trying out for cross country because that's what all the ""Christian"" kids did only to discover they would throw ""cross country parties"" that I was never invited to. These memories are ingrained into my psyche and while it has been years since this happened, I still have occasional nightmares. I mention all of this not to produce your sympathy but to demonstrate that my life hasn't been all roses.


In fact, one of my most profound struggles up to this point has been my own personal battle with depression and anxiety. At the age of 6, I was in a serious car accident that resulted in spending 6 days in a coma (i.e. traumatic brain injury). I was very lucky in that it did not cause cognitive/speech impairments; however, it did result in social/peer difficulties, seizures, and a lifelong battle with depression/anxiety. Isolation became a safe haven for me growing up and I found myself drawn far more to books than people. As a result, I spent most of my life anxious about my personal failings and hyper-vigilant towards rejection.


Fast forward several years and my depression hit an all time high in college as I was forced with the reality that I was not straight. I had spent years finding solace in the presence of God and a year dedicating my life to ministry. I was faced with a reality that placed me in the one category Christians deemed unacceptable and worthy of exile. What had once been my safe haven suddenly became my lion's den. Desperate to change, I reached out to countless pastors, spiritual leaders and counselors; doing anything and everything to change the one thing I knew deep-down I could not: my sexuality.


Having graduated with a bachelor's in Social Work (my personal alternative to ministry), I pursued 3 months of reparative therapy in a Christian Drug and Alcohol Treatment Facility. The people there were great and I have no ill feelings towards them, but it was a joke and quite honestly, a total waste of $10,000. To my dismay, the treatment provided me hope that changing my sexuality was possible and upon returning to real life, the reality that I could not caused my depression to worsen. However, I quickly rebounded in March of 2012 and started graduate school.


And now comes the part of my life story I am the most ashamed of; even more than my attempts at changing my sexuality. In order to cope with my depression and nurse my wounds from rejection and failed attempts at being becoming straight, I turned to substances. Inevitably, this created challenges in the professional world. It's a bit hypocritical to be working as a helping professional trying to help others overcome the very thing you do as soon as you end your work day. While I never showed up to work drunk or high, my substance abuse brought on so much guilt and shame that my ability to work effectively was greatly undermined.


My first job out of graduate school ended after having a grand mal seizure which put me back in my parents home at the age of 25. While I had a master's degree, I humbled myself and worked at a Walgreens for awhile. (If this is not a reality check- I don't know what is). I embraced an opportunity but things didn't work out and I unfortunately ended up back in my parents home. Several months passed in which my depression reached an all time high coupled with feelings of failure, shame and guilt. While I had the degree, I didn't have enough figured out to be successful.


What I've Learned


Then, by the grace of God, I landed a job doing crisis intervention. At first, I felt I was completely unqualified for such a role. Yes, I had the qualifications and educational experience to work in such a job, but my past failings and substance abuse issues made me feel that I was ineligible and not fit to do that kind of work. Yet, I moved forward believing that God had a plan and indeed, I feel his Hand was at work at each stage.


To my surprise, it turns that out that my battles with depression, history of passive suicidal ideation, battle with my own sexuality and history of substance abuse enhanced my ability to relate and build rapport with individuals in crisis rather than making me unqualified. If I had not struggled, I do not believe I would have the inherent empathy that I do now. Essentially, it's been my mistakes, not my successes, that made me into the type of counselor I am today.

-When people call the crisis line with feelings of hopelessness, I can understand.
-When individuals describe to me their desire to use substances to numb their emotional pain and obtain a moment of relief, I can understand.
-When people explain that they want to end their lives because they don't see a future, I can understand.
-When people tell me about hating themselves because they can't change a part of themselves that they don't like, I can understand.
-When people talk about their difficulties in employment, I can understand.


Coming out of graduate school, I believed that I had so many tools and theoretical interventions that I could change the world (sarcasm?). When I began working as a crisis intervention clinician, I thought that I had so much to offer. What I've learned is that most people just want to be heard. The ability to listen and validate an individual in their moment of greatest need is truly the greatest skill any counselor/social worker can have.


I want to re-emphasize that I never saw myself doing what I do now. It was not so long ago that I found myself un-employed and living with my parents. These were dark days for me but I was able to lift myself out of that hole. Sure, I still have my rough days and depression will kick me to the ground on occassion but I'm on a path and in a better place than I was before.


If I can impart any words of wisdom or guidance, it is this: don't give up. Sure, maybe things are shitty and life sucks right now but that doesn't mean you will stay there. On the contrary, perhaps it is this valley, this 'shittiness' of a situation, that sets the course for the rest of your life. Its totally possible that your current difficulties will someday be the very thing you use to help someone else.


All I can say is that when it comes to my lived experiences, my biggest failures and most embarrassing mistakes are the very things that molded me into the kind of person I am today. My darkest moments became my greatest strength and the same can be true for you.


With that in mind, know that there are people who want to help or simply lend you a listening ear.

55ki47,0,2016-10-02,Former Calgary Herald writer at heart of NYT article that investigates Trump tax return bombshell,CanadianBerry,Calgary,https://www.reddit.com/r/Calgary/comments/55ki47/former_calgary_herald_writer_at_heart_of_nyt/,"http://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/former-calgary-herald-writer-at-heart-of-trump-tax-return-bombshell

From C-Train derailments to a news story on tax returns that might end up derailing a presidential campaign.

Such is the impressive trajectory of a career that’s seen Calgarian Susanne Craig go from summer intern at the Calgary Herald in 1990 to lead reporter on a New York Times story that’s now being called the biggest crisis of Donald Trump’s White House campaign.

“I can safely say I don’t get tax returns of presidential candidates in my mailbox every day,” says Craig.

A political science graduate who wrote for The Gauntlet while attending the University of Calgary, Craig credits the Herald for “that first taste of reporting” that led to a life-long addiction for chasing the big story.

On Saturday, she may have produced her biggest yet.


“Donald J. Trump declared a $916 million loss on his 1995 income tax returns, a tax deduction so substantial it could have allowed him to legally avoid paying any federal income taxes for up to 18 years, records obtained by The New York Times show.”

So reads the first line of Craig’s bombshell, co-written with David Barstow, Russ Buettner and Megan Twohey, after an anonymous manila envelope containing Trump’s tax return was delivered to Craig’s mailbox at the New York Times.

The repercussions for Trump are huge, and his campaign has so far responded with allegations of conspiracy.

“The only news here is that the more than 20-year-old alleged tax document was illegally obtained, a further demonstration that the New York Times, like establishment media in general, is an extension of the Clinton Campaign, the Democratic Party and their global special interests,” said the Trump Campaign in a written statement.

The repercussions for Craig have included suddenly celebrity and requests for interviews from around the world.

She admits the spotlight makes her uneasy.

“It’s actually uncomfortable — if I’d wanted to be in front of the camera, I would have gone for a job in network news,” says Craig.

“I’m more into solitary work. I like pushing words around on a page. This is not a comfortable feeling.”

While working at the Herald, Craig covered stories like bicycle path speed limits, C-Train derailments, and the career of Stan Waters, Canada’s first elected senator.

She said the experience in Calgary convinced her reporting was her calling, but it was a rocky start landing a full-time job.

“I was a political science major, and without (a journalism degree), it made it very difficult to get a job,” says Craig.

Finally, the Star took a chance. From there, Craig’s natural tenacity and talent took her to The Globe and Mail, and then the Wall Street Journal, where she was lead reporter on Pulitzer-nominated coverage of the fall of the Lehman Brothers and the financial crisis.

And in 2010, she joined the New York Times, with her coverage of Trump starting with a single story early in the campaign. “But then he kept winning. I fell into this by happenstance,” she says."

I have met a great guy in Paris when I did an internship overseas last fall. At the beginning, we were just fooling around and having fun without taking ourselves too seriously. It's when I had to take the plane back that I realised how hard I am going to miss him and how much I have touched his heart. Since we have kept in touch via whatsapp. I came back in Paris for two weeks this summer to try if we are still a good pair. we continued getting along but I notice we have some differences in term of personality. Now I will soon finish my degree and I have already a small contract that will be renewed in February. However, I am debating whether I should join him in France. I am young so it is the perfect time to take such risks. But the cons are that I don't want to work in France since the job market is not that great compare to Canada and I love the job that I have now which is tough to get. also, we only have been together for a total of 5 weeks (3 during my internship and 2 this summer) in a whole year. Is it really worth sacrificing what I have for a first love that may not work out at the end? This post was way too long and maybe I gave too much details but it kinda felt good. Cheers,"
55kxd3,5,2016-10-02,Brown Graduate School Admissions,Phractylles,BrownU,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrownU/comments/55kxd3/brown_graduate_school_admissions/,"Hello reddit, I'm sort of new here so bear with me please.

To get to the point it has been my passion for many months now to work my way up to be counted with the geniuses at Brown's political science graduate department.  When I got Prof. Alex Gourevitch's book ""From Slavery to the Cooperative Commonwealth"" as a gift a while back I became fascinated with the evolution of American politics and I would specifically like to study and uncover new knowledge of the Republican party.  

I have always been interested and engaged in politics, in little ways like working for the voting polls during the '12 elections and I have excelled in my high school's debate team.  

However now I am a college sophomore with 5 semesters left.  I started out my first year rocky and now have a 3.23 gpa.

What I want to ask any current Brown candidates/ alumni what I need to do to step up my game to make my dream come closer.  I am not asking for you to rate my resumé.

I have a 3.23 gpa now at the University of North Texas , but I have been on track for all A's now and expect to graduate with a 3.6/7.  I changed my major from Criminal Justice to Integrative Studies just this semester because Brown's philosophy of letting students pick what they should learn inspired me to follow suit as best I can.  So now I am studying in not only criminal justice but also political science and communications.  Unfortunately I have B's in all my freshman level major classes, but I am getting A's in all my upper level now.  

I chose to concentrate on these areas because I have wanted to be a criminal attorney since I was 13 (cliché, I know.  I even put in 250+ hours of ""Teen Court"" volunteering.)  I feel relevant knowledge in these areas will make me a good candidate for a great law school in Texas; in addition to some research I will soon begin with a professor in my uni's poli sci department as well as my long-term internship with an established and popular trial attorney in my area.

So when I apply to the department at Brown in 5/6 years from now, I will have a 3.7 undergrad gpa, research in political science, a J.D from UT/SMU/TAMU and some other small accollades probably.  What else can I add to make myself a serious contender?

I would also like to add that I have been working 30 hours a week ever since I was 18 to support myself and my fiancée.  Will this make my low gpa more understandable?

Thank you for reading my post and thank you for any advice, I will consider anything!"

55l735,3,2016-10-02,"Temporarily closed the distance. But should I (24f) pull the plug on previously overconfident, now insecure SO (22m)?",garbageingarbageuff,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/55l735/temporarily_closed_the_distance_but_should_i_24f/,"Hello from a long-time lurker! Sorry for the lengthy post ahead.

It's 3am here right now. My SO (21m) and I (24f) have closed the distance temporarily (...yay?) and while he sleeps peacefully just in the next room, I am seized by so much sadness and anger after our conversation earlier today.

Background: We've just crossed the 6-month mark of our relationship. We met while he was on exchange at my college. He's from a country 20,000km away from mine and 1 year away from graduating. As I'm older by 2y, I've graduated and started working in my country. I love the country he's from, and had already planned on moving there sometime in the next 1-2 years, even before we'd met. He's a social butterfly and an extrovert who loves keeping busy. I am an introvert. When we first got together, I had many doubts: 1) about the distance (I've just graduated and getting a job in his country is not so easy for a fresh graduate), 2) about him having time in his very busy schedule for me. He had been very confident throughout that he would make time and make this work.

We've been through 3 months of LDR and 1 month of living together (when he was able to fulfill part of his graduating criteria by working in my country). LDR has its difficulties with the time difference and of course matching our few hours of shared awake time with his busy schedule. But living together for that 1 month went extraordinarily well - both of us agree on this. It felt completely easy to be together and to laugh and feel secure. I could see a future with him, and I thought he saw one too. I asked him several times if he felt it was too soon for us to live together and he always confidently assured me that it felt right.

Right now: He has just come back, again, to spend 3 months living in my country. By some stroke of luck (good or bad to be determined), he can fulfill another part of his graduating criteria in my country. It's been a disorienting experience for him because he literally had internship commitments back in his country right till the moment he flew, and he started his commitments here the day after flying 20,000km.

The issues: Today we were joking about future children and it surfaced that he doesn't think he will get married or settle down till he's &gt;30. The last time we spoke about this, before he started interning in his country or in mine, he had said he expected to marry around 25-26. I am 2 years older than him and had vaguely envisioned getting married around 25/26 as well. That sparked more questions from me about our current compatibility and to summarise:

- He feels overwhelmed and fearful that he is now simultaneously working for the first time in his life (as part of his graduating criteria), in a foreign country almost entirely alone and apart from his extensive social calendar, and living together with someone. He feels that he has skipped a whole transition phase and jumped into adulthood too fast. My response: I understand, and I will move back to my own home temporarily.

- Because of how disoriented he feels given the huge life change mentioned in the point above, he believes that when I move to his country (eta next 1 year) I will be similarly lonely and dependent. While I have had issues with him being too busy in the past, I am secure enough now (at least, till before this conversation) to be fine entertaining myself in his absence. I have assured him that I don't need a large social circle and that I have wanted to move there for a long time and know the hardship involved in moving 20k km. However, he seems convinced that I WILL be very dependent and in need of him. He feels that would be a big burden on him given his social calendar and place in life right now when everything is changing for him. I have to add that everything is changing and uncertain for me as well, since I've just graduated, but that I have had more time to adjust to the new phase of life.

- The difference in long-term plans mentioned above. I know we've only been dating for 6m and right now I'm not certain either that this is the person I want to spend the rest of my life with etc etc. But I do dislike complete uncertainty while he is perfectly fine living in the moment. My idea of when I see myself settling down is not fixed. To me, it seems that he's jumped from suggesting marriage at 25/26 to marriage at &gt;30 because he's undergoing so many disorienting life changes right now. But is that just false hope?

We have paused this conversation. I am moving back to my old home tomorrow to give him space that he needs (re: first point) to think things through. I am happy to also have personal space again but frustrated that his previous assurances and confidence that this would work actually mean nothing.

Sagely Redditors, I hope to hear from you. I have trouble knowing when to let go because of a previous emotionally abusive relationship. With my current SO, the chemistry is unbelievable and it's been so easy and natural to be together up to this point. Is what we're going through just a temporary and normal reflex to the new phase of life we (mainly he) are in? He thinks that I will be a dependent burden on him when I move despite my assurances that I will not be - is this him just convincing himself that it's not going to work? I feel like a loser just waiting for him to break up with me. Is it time to let go?

Thank you for working your way through this meandering ramble, guys. Wishing everyone here all the best"
55lb6q,42,2016-10-02,[Long] Why Nepotism Fails: A Study of the San Diego Chargers,cahman,Chargers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chargers/comments/55lb6q/long_why_nepotism_fails_a_study_of_the_san_diego/,"This team and ownership is a *great* example of why nepotism can and will bring down a team, business, organization, or nation.

[Here's a link on imgur](http://i.imgur.com/gnyeY7n.jpg) of the John Spanos bio on the Chargers website. I've underlined and marked certain sentences that I will reference through this post. 

If you want my final conclusion, just scroll to the end. But if you're as mad as I am, I would recommend reading this through. 

Let's start with the first quote: **""He oversees all of the team’s football operations"".** 

This is not a trivial position. Everything that happens on the football side (i.e. not business/stadium side) reflects personally on John Spanos. This is a multi-billion dollar franchise, and part of the largest professional sports leagues in America. This is not a position you want to fuck up in. **This is where you want a tried and true professional, who's been in the business for decades, knows the ins and outs, and how to be successful**. Even when you have a genius in there, the NFL is still stupidly hard to be successful in. And guess who our President of Football Operations is? A **trust fund baby** *of the son of the owner* of the team! [Yea, Dean is actually a trust fund baby too! How deep will this family tree go?]. This is about as unqualified as you can possibly get, even if you tried. But let's get into this deeper. Are you guys completely confused on why we have so many injuries, and we won't get new strength and conditioning staff? **Because we have an incompetent buffoon who is incapable of solving any problem at the helm of the team**

-------

The second underlined quote states: **""In 2003, [John Spanos] began working full-time as a scout""**. John Spanos is 36 years old. In 2003, John Spanos would be 23 years old. **What this means is the year John Spanos got out of college, he was immediately hired by his daddy's company.**

And it wasn't even for something that would make sense for a college hire, like accounting, or sales, or something in business. 

No, Johnny wanted to be a football expert. So he was hired as a **full time scout** for the team, with literally ***ZERO EXPERIENCE*** in football scouting.

For those of you who don't know, people who aren't given jobs by their billionaire father and want to be scouts do so by grinding out years of experience and proven results. Even then, prospective scouts are lucky to get an internship with a team. Even then, there's still so much competition to be a scout, few ever actually make it. But now we have John Spanos, who, with zero scouting experience, **got hired as a *full time* scout**. Classic nepotism: complete incompetence because of a lack of relevant experience.

But possible *even worse*, this also tells us that **Johnny has never had a real job in his entire life**. His entire life, he was pampered and given everything he wanted. He never had to cut his teeth, or improve his skills, or work hard to achieve his goals. No, Daddy gave it all to him, his very own football team!

--------

The third quote: **""He methodically worked his way up through the organization before his career took a giant leap forward in 2013 when he was named executive vice president of football operations**.

WOW, JOHNNY. YOU REALLY TOOK A *BIG LEAP FORWARD* IN YOUR CAREER ***WHEN YOUR DADDY GAVE YOU THE JOB.*** I'm sure you have every skill, and plenty of the experience **required to run an effective and winning football team**. After all, it's not like you were given this job, right?

I mean, could we possibly expect any other career timeline for this guy? Do you think he would ever get fired? Hell no. Would he ever not take over the team? Of course not. Once Dean got too old or just died in a bucket of Carson City trash, John's dream would eventually get realized. **There was zero incentive for him to work hard in his ""career"" with the Chargers.** It was all coming to him anyways. 

-------

4th Quote: **""he did just that as he was a key member of the selection committee responsible for the hiring of General Manager Tom Telesco and Head Coach Mike McCoy""**

He has no real life experience, his only job was working for his daddy, and now he thinks that he's qualified to pick out a head coach and general manager. In fact, he **BRAGS** about picking out McCoy!

You guys know why McCoy wasn't fired last season? **Because Johnny Spanos didn't want his first head coach to be a failure**. This is the culmination of John's entire life: He was promised this position since birth, he refused to get any real work experience, and now, for his first act of power, he picked out a GM and Head Coach. 

Now, when that head coach is failing, **John is refusing to admit he was wrong**. If he fires McCoy, he's admitting that he himself failed. 

***AND I GUARANTEE YOU JOHNNY SPANOS HAS NEVER HAD TO ADMIT A MISTAKE IN HIS ENTIRE PAMPERED AND SPOILED LIFE***

------

Final quote: **""Spanos has seen his role in the NFL Draft grow exponentially since his ascension in 2013""**

**WHAT. THE. FUCK.** WHY THE HELL IS THE FUCKING OWNER'S BRATTY SON DECIDING **WHO THE TEAM DRAFTS**. 

Johnny, I know you think you're so smart, and that you're a great scout (I mean, only great scouts get full time jobs out of college!), but ***LEAVE THE FUCKING FOOTBALL DECISIONS TO THE GROWNUPS WHO ACTUALLY KNOW FOOTBALL***. 

Also, I know that we generally think that Telesco has done a good job, and he may have seemingly got good talent, **but many of the failures of this team fall squarely on his shoulders too.** 

Actually, we can decide who to blame. If we believe Johnny Spanos lets Telesco actually have most of the responsibility and power in player decisions, then put the blame on Telesco for the items below. But just remember who hired him.

On the other hand, if John Spanos is making most of the player decisions, then **WHAT THE FUCKING FUCK,** and you can blame everything about this team that goes wrong on John Spanos.

I'm not sure which side to blame is worse.

However, we have seen this team have horrible o-line depth for two years, embarrassingly run Weddle out of town, drafting Fluker only for him to bust out of being a tackle, trading up for an ineffective and injury prone Te'o, trading up for Jerry Attaochu in the 2nd round, who lost his starting job to a 2nd year 5th rounder (who was rated one of the absolute worse OLBs this year by PFF), waste away many picks in order to move up a couple selections, and fail to produce any player of value past round 3.


Take out Verrett, Keenan Allen, and Denzel Perryman (and maybe Gordon? at the very least, a complete bust his first year), and we gained **NO OTHER GOOD PLAYERS** from 3 years of drafts. That averages **ONE ABOVE AVERAGE PLAYER PER DRAFT**. In reality, that is ***ABYSMAL***.

We can then talk about this draft. Yes, Hunter Henry seems good this year. Yes, Jatavius Brown has been a pleasant surprise. But it's way too early to judge them as draft picks. 

But we can judge the Bosa situation. Even if you think Bosa should have taken that ""final"" offer initially, John Spanos **completely lowballed** Bosa into holding out. And then he decides that Bosa has personally offended Johnny Spanos that Bosa doesn't deserve contract terms similar to other top picks, and goes in radio silence for weeks while Training Camp was going on. Lo and behold, when Bosa finally comes back, and not in football shape, he injures himself. **Bosa hasn't had a full practice in his entire career yet**. Thank you, John Spanos, for being such a great negotiator and for leading the team in a winning fashion.

We can then bring up all the great free agent acquisitions, and for good deal$ too! **GUESS WHAT: THE SUCCESSFUL FOOTBALL FRANCHISES BUILD FROM THE DRAFT AND DO NOT RELY ON FREE AGENCY**. 

Travis Benjamin, Brandon Mebane, Dwight Lowery, Casey Hayward, Jacoby Jones (LOL), Orlando Franklin, Stevie Johnson, Patrick Robinson, King Dunlap, Danny Woodhead, Rich Ohrnberger were **ALL FREE AGENTS** who were **SIGNED TO BE STARTERS**. And this is just the list from 2013-2016. The best teams, the Packers, Seahawks, Broncos, Patriots, Bengals, etc **DO NOT DO THIS.** 

***ONLY TEAMS THAT FAIL TO DRAFT HAVE TO SIGN THIS MANY FREE AGENTS***.

------

In conclusion, this team will never win with an incompetent, spoiled, idiotic, and failed President like John Spanos. Don't expect him to hire a better head coach, don't expect him to hire better strength and conditioning staff, don't expect him to acquire better and more durable players. This is what we can expect from the reign of John Spanos. 

Oh, and don't expect them to sell the team. [As Dean explains himself](http://www.mighty1090.com/2015/06/18/dean-spanos-says-he-wont-sell-chargers/), the Chargers are the only thing in the Spanos family they care for. This is their life. They won't ever give that up. They're pathetic. And this team will be too, as long as the Spanos Family owns and runs it.

55mcs3,1,2016-10-03,Fortuna Düsseldorf: Alex Madlung rechnet nicht mit Sperre,betamax65,fcsp,https://www.reddit.com/r/fcsp/comments/55mcs3/fortuna_düsseldorf_alex_madlung_rechnet_nicht_mit/,"[](http://ift.tt/2dAHJ7z)Alexander Madlung könnte eine Sperre nicht nachvollziehen © Imago

Trainer Friedhelm Funkel hat sich öffentlich noch nicht dazu geäußert, doch intern dürfte man bei Fortuna Düsseldorf schon wissen, dass Alexander Madlung nach seinem Ellenbogenschlag am Samstag gegen [Karlsruhes Franck Kom](http://ift.tt/2cWEcDj) eine nachträgliche Sperre droht.

**Die TV-Bilder zeigen Madlungs Aussetzer, der Schiedsrichterin Bibiana Steinhaus und ihren Assistenten verborgen geblieben ist, jedenfalls so klar, dass alles andere als Ermittlungen durch den Kontrollausschuss des DFB eine Überraschung wären, zumal mit Fürths Robert Zulj und Lasse Sobiech vom FC St. Pauli erst kürzlich zwei andere Zweitliga-Profis wegen ähnlicher Vergehen für drei bzw. zwei Spiele aus dem Verkeh gezogen worden sind.**

### Provokation von Franck Kom?

Madlung selbst allerdings könnte es nicht verstehen, müsste er wegen dieser Aktion die nächsten Spiele von der Tribüne aus verfolgen. _“Ich wüsste nicht warum. Wenn man vor jedem Freistoß und jeder Ecke die Leute mit der Kamera ran zoomt, macht man den ganz Sport kaputt. Da hätte man die halbe Mannschaft gesperrt. Das ist ein Männersport, da geht es um Zweikämpfe. Sperren für so was sind lachhaft”_, erklärte der Routinier gegenüber [Bild](http://ift.tt/2dAGBki) seine zumindest etwas fragwürdige Sichtweise.

Sperren für so was sind lachhaft. (Alexander Madlung)

Madlung betonte zugleich, dass seiner Aktion eine Provokation vorausgegangen sei, was sich im Fall der Fälle zumindest strafmildernd auswirken würde: _“Wenn es Bilder von hinten geben würden, könnte man sehen, dass er mich hält. Warum wird ein so kleiner Spieler von 1,50 m überhaupt gegen mich gestellt? Um mich beim Kopfballduell zu bezwingen? Er will mich festhalten, mir auf den Fuß treten.”_

**Vor Ermittlungen dürften ihn diese Aussagen allerdings kaum bewahren. Kann eine Provokation durch Kom nachgewiesen werden, könnte Madlung aber mit zwei Spielen Sperre davonkommen.**

55mdwc,1,2016-10-03,I [29M] have a crush on a girl [21F] from my work. Should I pursue this or just forget about it?,AwkwardThrowaway2222,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/55mdwc/i_29m_have_a_crush_on_a_girl_21f_from_my_work/,"I first met Lucy (fake name) when she was an intern in my department. At the time, she was 20, and in her last year of college. She and I worked well together, and we started talking outside of work, as well. It was nothing serious, and it's not like we were talking every day: we would just occasionally exchange dumb Snapchats and talk about the newest episode of Game of Thrones, that sort of thing. We were working on a project together, and used that as an excuse to get coffee once a week.

I can't deny that I had feelings for her, but I never acted on them. For one, we worked together, and I didn't want to make things awkward. I was also a little wary of the age gap: I didn't want to be the stereotypical creepy adult dating a student.

When she graduated, she was offered a job at the company (albeit in a different department). We didn't see each other at work as much, but we maintained contact as friends and kept up our schedule of going to lunch. For her 21st birthday, she invited me to go out drinking, explaining that most of her college friends were busy and/or had left the city. We stayed out until 3AM, first at the bar, then just walking around the city and talking. At the end of the night, as she was waiting for her ride, we hugged, and she held my hand until the car pulled up.

It's been four months since that night, and I still feel like a coward. I know that I need to either make a move or accept that we're never going to be together so that I can finally start to get over her. That's why I'm here, I guess. 

tldr: I have a massive crush on a girl from my work (first met her as an intern, now working in a different department). People of Reddit, do you think that all age gap relationships are inherently problematic, or could this work out? Am I being creepy? And if I'm not, and I should go for it, how can I even approach her in a romantic fashion after being ""just friends"" for so long?"
55ng3q,2,2016-10-03,[PI] Nightmare Walking,Volvary,VolvaryWrites,https://www.reddit.com/r/VolvaryWrites/comments/55ng3q/pi_nightmare_walking/,"Twisting very slightly from [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/55773g/wp_we_forget_our_dreams_for_a_reason_in_the_near/) prompt, this story can be seen as an opening chapter to a much larger piece.

When the EMDC, the Electromagnetic Dream Catcher, came into action, we added an additional waiver you could sign to allow us to, anonymously or not, add your dreams to our data bank, so we could look for patterns in human dreams. We never expected it to reveal such dark implications.

During the initial testing, one of the test subject had a dream of a man in dark. A man that crept up to him and told him weird and distorted things. His phrases twisted and crumpled on themselves, rendering them unintelligible. Another of the test subject had the same thing happen with what had seemed like a queen of some brigand group. The lady, dressed in classic buccaneer clothes, told the subject some weird things that made no sense. Both subject stated remembering those figures from way back when.

When the EMDC was released to the public, 42% of people signed the waiver, 28% anonymously, giving us a good sample size. And access to a dark societal secret. Of those people, nearly all had frequent dreams where at least one of the four Horsemen, as we now called them, appeared to them, talking either in a twisted language or a mix of their native language and that unintelligible vocabulary.

After weeks of pattern analysis, we noticed recurring trends. Those visited by the Horsemen woke up the next day, reacting ever so slightly different to specific stimulus. Cassyva, the only Horseman who had given us a name, tended to push people toward leading others. CEOs, team leaders and other spokesperson were visited at least every week by the pirate figure. The Shade, the formless man in rags one of the original test subject had seen, tended to seclude people, warping the psyche to be more of an anti-social nature. The Hunter, an indigenous looking man, covered in tribal tattoos, leather clothing and a bow and quiver in his back, slowly raised the risk taking attitude of people he visited. Dark Mane, a humanoid looking creature with long hair reaching under his floating body, tended to appear to people hiding their true nature and pushed them to be themselves. Closet gays, bis and other orientations. People repressed by their peers, forced to hide their nature, those who had to hide to keep their job or reputation. Most people had to flee to do so but were generally much more happy afterward.

By the time we had understood the implications, the population had started to wake up to the existence of the Horsemen, although they were still in the dark as far as their powers.

This morning, as I launched a scan for a specific pattern in the dreams we had collected, the presence of two of the Horsemen, our newest intern stormed into the room, the door slamming into the doorstop and returning straight for his shoulder.

""I did it! Michael, I did it!"" said the intern, his hand on his shoulder.

""What did you do?"" I asked, unsure about what he was talking.

""I dreamed."" he replied. He had not been able to dream for a few weeks. Ever since he had met the last of the Horsemen.

""Did you..."" I started.

""I controlled the dream. I lucid dreamed.""

""What did you try?""

""I... I called for the Horsemen...""

""They came?""

""I was expecting Dark Mane to come or maybe Cassyva.""

""Let me guess... Shade did?""

""He did. So did the others.""

""Fuck.""

It was known that Cassyva and Shade hated each other. So did Hunter and Dark Mane.

""What happened?"" I asked, trying to know how dangerous the situation was.

""Cassyva attacked Shade. Dark Mane protected his friend. Hunter jumped in.""

""Mmm... That would explain it.""

""What?"" he asked as I pulled the newspaper under my coffee mug.

The front page read ""Violent Aggression Numbers Explode Across Town"".

""You think..."" he started as I pulled out names from our database.

""Iori Steel, 24. Gets frequent visits of Dark Mane. Attacked a man named Gregory Webber this morning.""
""Let me guess, Webber sees Hunter?""

""Roderick Ian. 31. Shot a man at 9:11 AM. Victim's name is Quinn Arnot."" I said as the files opened on screen, listing them respectively as Cassyvans and Shaded. ""Need more?""

""I fucked up, I think.""

55nnju,2,2016-10-03,M4F First Monday in October...Let's Have Some Fun!,BreakFromReality,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/55nnju/m4f_first_monday_in_octoberlets_have_some_fun/,"Hi there, and welcome to DPP Casino! I'm your host, BreakFromReality, and I'll be accompanying you in your journey to find a fun, erotic roleplay.

Please check your ID with the security guard -- all potential RP partners and their characters MUST be at least 18.

So now that you're here, how do you get started?

First, you'll sit down at our [single-deck blackjack table](https://www.random.org/playing-cards/), where you'll be deciding the kinks of the RP. You'll be dealt eight starting hands of blackjack, with each total matching up with a specific kink. (For example, a 20 is for cheating.)

Here's the full list of kinks:

* 4 -- Dealer's Choice
* 5 -- Light Bondage
* 6 -- Group Sex (MFMF, MFMFMF)
* 7 -- MFM Threesome
* 8 -- FFM Threesome
* 9 -- Interracial/Raceplay
* 10 -- Anal (Woman Receiving)
* 11 -- Filmed
* 12 -- Clothed Sex
* 13 -- Dirty Talk/Name-Calling
* 14 -- Rough Sex (Hair-Pulling, Spanking, Light Choking, etc.)
* 15 -- Public Sex
* 16 -- Creampie/Risk of Impregnation
* 17 -- Facial
* 18 -- Risk of Getting Caught (i.e. ""hold the moan"")
* 19 -- Uniform/Costume
* 20 -- Cheating
* 21 -- Player's Choice

Once eight unique hands are drawn, you will choose two kinks that you would like to include in the RP. You will also eliminate two other kinks that you would not like to include. The dealer will then choose two kinks of the remaining four.

The Dealer's Choice and Player's Choice can not be excluded.

*(To play: draw 2 cards from 1 shuffled deck. Make sure all cards except jokers are included. Repeat this eight times until complete.)*

Once the kinks are decided, you'll decide if you want to stay on the main casino floor or head over to The Den. *(While I will absolutely play with everyone, those choosing to go to The Den will get VIP status.)*

If you choose the main floor, you will head to our [roulette wheel](https://www.random.org/sequences/), where you'll help decide the character you'll be playing. The women listed on the wheel will be character models only (with one exception).

The list is as follows:

* 0 -- Player's Choice of Anyone on the List
* 1 -- You, because you're always #1 at DPP Casino!
* 2 -- Bella Thorne
* 3 -- Dove Cameron
* 4 -- Laurel Coppock
* 5 -- Alison Brie
* 6 -- Kendall Jenner
* 7 -- Candice Patton
* 8 -- Margot Robbie
* 9 -- Vanessa Hudgens
* 10 -- Scarlett Johansson
* 11 -- Taylor Swift
* 12 -- Miley Cyrus
* 13 -- Ariana Grande
* 14 -- Emma Stone
* 15 -- Milana Vayntrub
* 16 -- Nina Dobrev
* 17 -- Rihanna
* 18 -- Sarah Hyland
* 19 -- Lily Aldridge
* 20 -- Mila Kunis
* 21 -- Stella Maxwell
* 22 -- Dianna Agron
* 23 -- Chloe Grace Moretz
* 24 -- Katherine McNamara
* 25 -- Victoria Justice
* 26 -- Carrie Underwood
* 27 -- Jennifer Lawrence
* 28 -- Selena Gomez
* 29 -- Emilia Clarke
* 30 -- Emily Ratajkowski
* 31 -- Meghan Markle
* 32 -- Jourdan Dunn
* 33 -- Katy Perry
* 34 -- Aubrey Plaza
* 35 -- Nicole Beharie
* 36 -- Ariel Winter

You will spin the wheel six times (12 for two-female scenes and 18 for three-female scenes). You will then pick three characters (six for two-female scenes and nine for three-female scenes). The dealer will then choose the character he would like you to play (the Player's Choice may get excluded).

*(To play: Set the smallest value at 0 and the largest value at 36, and keep it in one column. Take the first 6/12/18 numbers in the list.)*

Finally, it's time to ""role"" the dice at the [craps table](https://www.random.org/dice/) and see just what you'll be playing. The roles are below:

* 2 -- Dealer's Choice
* 3 -- Coach's Daughter
* 4 -- Friend's Wife/Girlfriend
* 5 -- Student
* 6 -- Sister's/Daughter's Friend
* 7 -- Incest (Daughter, Sister, Cousin)
* 8 -- Friend's Sister/Daughter
* 9 -- Work Scenario (Secretary, Intern, Co-Worker, etc.)
* 10 -- Wife's/Girlfriend's Friend
* 11 -- Bully's/Bullying Victim's Sister
* 12 -- Player's Choice

*(If Celebrity is chosen, you will be playing the actual celebrity from the wheel instead of a lookalike. For 12, I am giving the option of playing either the bullying victim's sister or an interesting revenge plot with the bully's sister.)*

You will roll the dice four times. Of the four unique roles, you will then discard one. The dealer will discard one of the remaining three, and you will then choose one (or both, if possible) of the remaining two.

*(To play: simply roll two virtual dice. Repeat until four different roles are picked.)*

After that is done, we will have the RP with the characters, roles and kinks!

Now if you choose The Den?

Here's the list of characters for the roulette wheel:

* 0 -- Player's Choice of Anyone on the List
* 1 -- You, as a woman age 40+ (if you're not one already)
* 2 -- Rena Sofer
* 3 -- Nigella Lawson
* 4 -- Christie Brinkley
* 5 -- Eva Longoria
* 6 -- Rashida Jones
* 7 -- Jane Seymour
* 8 -- Elizabeth Hurley
* 9 -- Jennifer Lopez
* 10 -- Julianna Margulies
* 11 -- Patricia Heaton
* 12 -- Cheryl Hines
* 13 -- Jordan Ladd
* 14 -- Jennifer Aniston
* 15 -- Giada de Laurentiis
* 16 -- Julie Bowen
* 17 -- Alyson Hannigan
* 18 -- Gabrielle Union
* 19 -- Melinda Clarke
* 20 -- Jennifer Garner
* 21 -- Marcia Cross
* 22 -- Christina Hendricks

* 26 -- Natalie Imbruglia
* 27 -- Mary-Louise Parker
* 28 -- Kate Beckinsale
* 29 -- Sofia Vergara
* 30 -- Julianne Moore
* 31 -- Kim Cattrall
* 32 -- Ellen Barkin
* 33 -- Sharon Stone
* 34 -- Paula Patton
* 35 -- Mary Steenburgen
* 36 -- Courteney Cox

And here are the roles:

* 2 -- Dealer's Choice
* 3 -- Coach's Wife
* 4 -- Friend's Wife
* 5 -- Teacher/Principal
* 6 -- Mom's Friend
* 7 -- Incest (Mom, Aunt, Grandmother)
* 8 -- Friend's Mom
* 9 -- Work Scenario (Boss, Co-Worker, etc.)
* 10 -- Wife's Friend
* 11 -- Bully's/Bullying Victim's Mom
* 12 -- Player's Choice

That does it for our tour! We can't wait to play with you, and we know you'll have a good time; others have! 

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. And from all of us at DPP Casino, have a winning day!"

Also sorry if this is the wrong sub, please redirect if so.

My wife got suddenly terminated by a vindictive , toxic, vile bitch of a boss. Details aren't important and the woman is lucky we don't have children to support and are fortunate enough to be in a very comfortable living situation.

That said, she got fired 3 months ago to the day. We have been following all the steps for unemployment, and if approved, are eligible for up to 20 weeks initially. As I understand it, that will be paid in a lump sum at this point. What I mean is if it were to finally clear this week, we would receive 14 weeks worth in a lump sum.

Today she had a final phone hearing that the judge will use to determine Eligibility. After that determination, her old boss still has 20 days to dispute, which we have every reason to believe she will do.

I guess I am looking for some insight into this. The case is won, (barring an out of left field ruling by the judge) it is so cut and dry that she deserves unemployment that there is no doubt in my mind that this part will be in our favor.

So, we have had the phone hearing and the judge's ruling is on the way. Can we expect to finally get some money now, or should we expect to have to wait it all out more, as the boss still has an opportunity to dispute?

If we can expect to wait, is there any avenue I have not explored (not paying a lawyer, this case will go our way) that can speed up this process? The principle behind this is mind boggling to me. If we were even slightly less fortunate, we would be financially fucked right now.

Also...

The amount we will receive (if it is a lump sum, please tell me if it isnt) for those 14 weeks is around 4200 dollars. That just so happens to be right around the amount of credit card debt that we have total, it's actually a bit more, which will pay off a private loan I took out to cover my internship tuition cost to finally get my diploma a couple years back.

That's what I plan to do with the money if we get it, be credit card debt free and get rid of that loan. We also owe a much larger amount to student loans and have a car payment, but that seems like the best use of the money, and since the amount is so close to those debts, I take it as a bit of a sign.

Thanks a ton for any advice!"

55owh4,39,2016-10-03,"Taking a break, talk of abuse &amp; CF life. Looooong.",LadyLatitude,infertility,https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/55owh4/taking_a_break_talk_of_abuse_cf_life_looooong/,"Fellow Barren Bitches, I need a break from this sub. 

I feel like I'm changing. I feel like I don't quite fit in here anymore. I'm a veteran here, (or so I feel I am with all of the new usernames) and I just don't feel the way I used to about my infertility. This is a wonderful space for those who need support,. I believe I've contributed a lot here; I've opened my soul here, but I'm just not up for that anymore. 

Infertility has been one shit-filled bag of a journey after another. Currently, my husband is waiting on security clearances for his new job that offers IF coverage. We will do one more IVF cycle as soon as we can. If it fails, I strongly feel that we'll be done, maybe we'll do a third, it depends. I know I've said it before, but I'm running out of gas quickly (and eggs, DOR is fun y'all). 

More and more my husband and I talk about our life childfree, starting a business, living abroad for a few years, retiring early, living on a boat, or in a tiny condo, etc. Especially now, he's about to start a job where he will travel Mon-Thurs. Also, we planned for me to stay home with the baby, but now that we live in California ($$$) we can't afford that. I'm sure we could figure it all out if we got lucky, but for now, our life no longer seems to lean towards the traditional nuclear family anymore. When we think about this upcoming IVF cycle, we agree we're not doing it because we think or even hope it will work, but so that we can always know we gave it our very, very, very best try. Adulting is hard; it's especially heartbreaking when you learn dreams don't always come true. 

But my infertility will not ruin my life. I no longer wish to prioritize treatment in my life. There, I said it. (I feel better).

One last thing, I've mentioned this vaguely a few times, but I was sexually abused by my older brother when I was a pre-teen and early teen. I was adopted, and he was my parents oldest (biological) son. He was 16 years older than me. My parents were emotionally abusive to all of their children, and so he was never encouraged to leave the nest. He never moved out, and I couldn't escape him. Many times I would wake up naked feeling groggy. I know he drugged me. I don't think he ever raped me, but I'll never know for sure. He died of a drug over-dose (irony?) when I was in high school, so what is there to be done now? Not much. 

It's so hard to fight the anger that wells up inside of me because I know this experience I had, these issues I thought I had dealt with, are affecting my ability to continue treatment. For example, I was *HORRIFIED* to learn everything that was done to my unconscious body during my lap. Do you know they scrub your vagina and leave you to air dry? They shave you and my RE *let his intern perform a pelvic on me with a speculum* when I was drugged and unable to say fuck no. They insert devices into your uterus through your vagina, and there are half a dozen people in the room. I was so angry that I was only told about the camera in the navel and the two tiny incisions on your lower abdomen. I was lied to and dismissed. You all likely were. I know what you're thinking, I should have told my RE about the abuse. But no, I shouldn't have to wear a label of abuse for my fucking doctor to respect my body conscious or unconscious. Then again, at my egg retrieval, I knew exactly what would happen, and I was so nervous. I was shaking and crying and my (pregnant) anesthesiologist literally asked me ""what's my problem"". Over sedation is common in American medical practice, and I'm sick of it. But, I suppose this is really another topic of conversation. The thing is, all of this may not be a big deal to you, and I envy you that, but it's huge to me. Huge. But the abuse affected me even before IF treatment when we were still doing timed intercourse. 

It's time for me to stop ignoring these feelings. I need to take back my body and my life. I need to move forward. This sub is full of so many people I've grown to care so much about. But, it represents a certain place in my life, a place I'm thinking about leaving. 

Infertility will always be a thing. Sad, but true. So, this sub will always have a revolving population (be nice to the newbies, newbies, read the rules). We come, we cry, we get poked and prodded, we give all of our dollars, we get our baby or we don't and we move on. Everyone's journey is different, and everyone's stay varies in length. I know I'm not ""graduating"" in the sense we talk about here, but maybe we should also call those who choose to stop infertility treatments as graduates as well?

I'm not going to disappear though. I'll check in on my girls (and guys!). Once our IVF get's put on a calendar, I'll be more active, I'm sure. I'm a new mod over at r/CFCrafting, so check me out there. Also, if you live in SoCal, I *am* still planning a meet-up (send me your email!) because I need friends in my new city.

Thank you to everyone who was here for me when I needed it. Thank you for holding my hand and giving me support. I hope that I offered as much support in return. I wish so much for all of your dreams to come true, but because we don't always get what we dream of, I also wish you lasting peace and happiness. What we give each other here can never be repaid. I love you all so much. &lt;3

**UPDATE:** You guys have brought me to tears with your love and warmth!!! I just cannot thank everyone here enough for this endless support and love. This break, while definitely needed, is so bittersweet because y'all are absolutely amazingly wonderful and beautiful people, inside out. I will miss this sisterhood. Thank you, thank you so much!!!!! &lt;3"

Thru that time I've grieved and tried to put my best foot forward with finishing school and continue working. It's been an awful year in my eyes. Working a long unpaid internship and holding down a part time job to supplement income is wearing me out. All these goals that I had planned were about settling down and sharing a life with her. She was a positive influence on me and I can never forget that. Our relationship didn't last very long, less than 6 months but that time meant a lot to me still. We're not compatible and that's all there was to it. The break up wasn't bad and we ended off on an uneventful note. It still feels one-sided because I wanted to continue on with her but we're just not the right fit. I recently wrote her an email thanking her for the changes in my life but didn't expect a reply because she's moved on and looks to be in a serious relationship with someone else. Seeing these pictures even after a year and how happy she looks with her new boyfriend still causes some heartache even though I know it shouldn't. I keep thinking about how she deserves someone more fitting for her. I wish I could just be over it completely."
55pxsn,5,2016-10-03,I (30/F) helped friend (32/F) until I started to feel taken advantage of - friend stonewalled me and told me I violated her rights.,Toddtodd,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/55pxsn/i_30f_helped_friend_32f_until_i_started_to_feel/,"Facts:

July – friend calls and says she wants to move to my city, to be near me. I tell her that sounds cool and offer that she can stay at my place for a little while while she gets acclimated to the new city. Offer that she can stay with me for a little while for no rent. Tell her I can hook her up with an internship.


Early august – talk to friend on phone, tell her all the tips and tricks on moving across the country with the greatest ease. She takes my advice, it helps to save her hundreds of dollars and a lot less stress. Tell my friend that to make things easier I’m going to move out of my house, and move in with my boyfriend so that she can have my room for a little while. I spend a weekend moving all of my belongings out of my house to accommodate her moving into my house. I clean the room, put new sheets and blankets on bed, get her towels and bath supplies, get her food for her first few days in town. 


Second week in august – tell friend she needs to apply for the internship I hooked her up with. Send her all the paperwork she needs to fill out. She does not fill it out in time – I try to tell her she needs to do the paperwork in order to start internship. She does not respond. I put my name on the line to get her internship. I ask her if she’s still interested – she says yes but she hasn’t had time to fill out paperwork. It is literally a one page form. She is sending me pictures of her laying poolside relaxing. 


Mid August – friend arrives at airport that is 2 hours away from city where I live. Plane arrives late, gets in at midnight when it was supposed to land at 7pm. I pick friend up from airport and drive us back to my city – arrive at my house at 2am. Friend does not acknowledge what a pain in the ass it was for me to drive two hours and then wait for five hours and then drive back another two hours. Friend says she wants to stay at my boyfriends house that night because she’s uncomfortable staying in a new house without me. I tell her no, my boyfriend is already doing a lot to accommodate this situation and he’s stressed/overextended as it is. I drop friend off at my house, show her where everything is, help her settle in a little bit and then drive another 30 minutes to boyfriends house.


Third week in August – explain to friend that money is tight for me and she will need to start paying rent after 1.5 months of rent free. She says she understands.


Friend finally gets her paperwork in for internship – she starts internship late. 


I take friend car shopping and help her negotiate for a good deal on a car – I introduce her to a car dealer that I know to be honest, and I use my boyfriend’s social status in town to help her get a good deal. Friend never thanks me or boyfriend for help. 


Fourth week in August – room in my house opens up for friend to live in – and I have the opportunity to move back into my own house. I tell friend she needs to move into extra room that opened up – and since the rent for that room is half the price of the other room – ask her to pay for September and October rent. She says she wont pay me for September and October rent – but she can start paying for the smaller room in October. I say that’s fine. I tell her I’d like her to be moved into the newly opened room within five days, so I can move back into my house.


First week in September – friend stops showing up for internship without notice. After two days of no show, I ask if she is okay (im concerned that something is wrong) she says she decided to stop going to internship because now that she has to pay rent she wants to focus on finding a job. I ask her why she didn’t tell anyone before just leaving – she doesn’t reply. I feel frustrated and disrespected.


Second week in September - I start to move my things back into my house – and realize that my friend has been putting her cigarette butts into my potted plants and also using a dish of mine as an ash tray – without asking me first. I send her a text telling her not to use any of my things as an ashtray. She does not respond.


Third week in September – I email my housemate to explain how things are going to work now that friend is contributing to rent. Housemate starts to squabble with me about how I should charge my friend less rent because she’s unemployed and needs my help. I explain to housemate that friend is an adult, can get a job like everyone else, and has had plenty of help in that she’s been living rent free on my dime for 1.5 months. Housemate realizes the logic in what I’m saying, and apologizes for her statements. Housemate says that friend has started to pull housemate into drama. I tell housemate I totally understand…and that I’ll try my best to keep housemate out of any issues that might arise between me and friend. Housemate and I agree on how to split up Friend’s contribution to rent.


Third week in September – I email friend and explain the breakdown of rent and when it is due. I also explain that I feel disrespected by friend (1) ditching on an internship that I helped her to get…and I explain to friend that I had to put my name on the line to get her that position, and (2) that friend thought it was okay to put her cigarette butts in my plants and bowls. I explain to friend that I think she owes me an apology. Friend responds by telling me that I’ve treated her like dog shit and that she would never treat anyone the way I have treated her…that I should be kinder to friend and that friend needed me during this difficult time in her life. I decide not to respond to her – except to say we have a difference of opinion and if she would like to tell me how she feels in person I will be at my house later. I come home, friend acts like nothing happened. I wait two days and friend never apologizes or acknowledges her disrespect towards me. 


Fourth week in September – I tell friend the living situation is not working out for me and it would be better for our friendship if she moved out by October 1. I tell her if she needs to take the full weekend to move out by October 2 – that’s okay too. She says she will be out by October 2.


Few days later – friend asks for more time. I tell her that I feel uncomfortable being at my own house and I don’t feel comfortable with her staying any longer. 


October 1 – I come to my house. Friend has locked me out (front door has lock that can only be locked/unlocked from inside). I call friend to let me into house. She does not pick up. I get into house by jumping through my window. Friend hides in her room and does not come out. I see that none of friends things are moved out of house, I start to get nervous she is not planning to leave.


October 2 – ask friend when her things will be out of house, at 4pm nothing of hers is out of the house. She tells me that she knows her rights as a tenant and I have violated her rights. I ask her when she plans to be out of the house, she says the day is not over yet. I ask her to leave her keys under the door mat when she leaves. I leave house while friend is there (tension is high).
9pm I come back to my house, and she is moved out but has not left keys. I text her asking where are the keys and she does not respond. 


TLDR: offer to help friend by letting her stay at my house rent free for 1.5 months – friend does a few things that make me feel disrespected and I tell her us living together is not working out – friend moves out and tells me that I’ve violated her rights and she keeps copies of my house keys. 


Question: am I a total asshole, or is my friend just being really dramatic and jerky?

55qosb,44,2016-10-03,Interrogated by Man with Creepy Van,UrsineKing,LetsNotMeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/55qosb/interrogated_by_man_with_creepy_van/,"This happened a little over a year ago at this point. I was working the night shift at a smaller Walmart that shared a parking lot with a dollar store. I know everyone assumes that Walmart is a magnet for creeps, and the night shift seems like it would only increase the encounters. But surprisingly, I very rarely had any incidents with strange people in the 11PM to 8AM shifts I would work 5 days a week. The most I'd see was the occasional homeless person that would scare the daylights out of me after I'd accidentally stumble upon them in the parking lot.

My job was maintenance, but since we didn't have any overnight cart pushers I was usually the one sent out to go collect carts. Our Walmart was actually pretty popular at night despite its size and the time of night. This meant I was almost constantly being sent out to go collect carts for the first half of my shift. This was how I ran into one of the weirdest encounters with a stranger I've ever had while working at Walmart, or anywhere for that matter.

While gathering carts around 2AM as the activity was beginning to die down, I saw a very old looking van pull into the entrance between the Walmart and the dollar store. Although it ultimately parked in the empty dollar store parking lot, I got a good look at it as it first game in. It was very clearly in awful condition, it made a loud squeaking noise every time the tires made a full rotation, the exterior was covered in rust, and several of the windows seemed to have been broken. But the thing that stood out to me the most was, and I kid you not, in purple spray paint the words ""FREE CHILDRENS BIKES"" was crudely painted on the side. The thing that just really creeped me out wasn't just this creepy van, but the fact that it pulled into the dollar store parking lot, but the the dollar store was very clearly closed.

I still had a lot of carts to go gather, but I couldn't stop looking over at the van. Things just got creepier the more looked at it. The interior was completely dark and I couldn't see anyone inside of it. I never heard anyone leave the van and I was the only one in that parking lot other than the person in that van. It just gave me the creeps.

Eventually I had to go and gather carts from the outskirts of the parking lot, some of which were even in the dollar store's parking lot. I knew I had to go collect them, my manager would throw a fit if I wasn't doing my job because of a creepy van so I just sucked it up and went out to grab them. When I got a very yards from the van suddenly the headlights turned on and they were so bright I was blinded for a moment. At first I was terrified I was about to be run over, but the van stood still. After standing there like an idiot, I realized I was probably the one looking like a creep to this person. So I went back to gathering carts and got them all sorted out as quickly as a I could.

But as I was heading back into the store I heard the loud creak of the van door opening. I looked back long enough to see a man with a long, greasy, black hair. He had tattered clothes and he just looked like a mess and he seemed to be heading towards the store entrance, towards me. I got back into the store right then and there. At least there I'd be around my co-workers and I'd have strength in numbers if things went wrong. I mentioned something to my manager about it, but he told me to not make a big deal about it. I didn't expect much sympathy from him anyway, but it really did suck.

Getting back to my normal work routine, I got a dust mop and began sweeping up the floor. As I went through the aisles, I'd often pass some of the overnight stockers filling up the shelves. But other aisles were just empty. Around 15 minutes into my sweeping I turned around a corner into the pet food aisle and I saw him. He didn't have a cart or any items in his hand. It was immediately clear that he wasn't in that aisle for the pet food, he was there for me. He walked up in front of me and he started saying... something to me. I say 'something' because I legitimately had a hard time understanding him. He slurred his words hard, and it didn't help that I'm hard of hearing. I asked him to repeat himself and the second time all I really got out of it was ""tell ______ that he doesn't work here anymore"". I didn't really catch the name, but I'm pretty sure that was what he said.

I told him I didn't know what he meant. And he just kept going on and I legitimately couldn't understand him. Eventually I told him I'd go contact one of my supervisors for more help, and that's when he just screamed NO! I wasn't sure what to do, so I just backed away and I was ready to run. But he didn't chase after me, he just backed out of the aisle as well and turned away. Maybe he just knew I was going to grab a manager or something.

Everything remained normal for a while after that. At 3AM I clocked out for my scheduled lunch. I'm not much of a people person, so I avoided the break room or other common places during lunch. Instead I'd go out and eat in my car where I could listen to my own radio stations and I could be in peace. What I'd usually do is lift up the divider between the driver's and passenger's seat, and I'd lay across the seat. It'd give me an hour to just lay down for a bit anyway. I'd usually lay my head against the driver's side window, because it was nice and cold.

This night around 30 minutes into my break I felt that distinct feeling that I was being watched. I looked over my should outside the window and there he was, standing right outside my driver's side door. My heart felt like it skipped a beat and I just panicked. I just wanted to know what this guy wanted from me? Was it because I kept looking at his van? In that moment I was so glad I was always paranoid something like this would happen and because of that I locked the doors every time I would eat in my car. I started my car and I quickly pulled out of the spot I was parked in. I just drove off and out of the parking lot. I didn't need to be back for another 30 minutes anyway, so I just drove around for a while to take my mind off of things.

I pulled back into the Walmart parking lot around 20 minutes later and I saw the dollar store with 3 or 4 police cars with their sirens going off, surrounding the van. I went back inside, clocked in, and thankfully didn't see the guy anywhere. I asked my manager what was with the cars and he said a customer complained about it and had them call the cops. I didn't see the guy ever again, but I had nightmare about it for weeks. Thankfully I ended up getting an internship later and I just quit that job as soon as I could because it wasn't the same after that."

The bamboo bike is a sustainable alternative to the conventional aluminium frame. It is produced in Ghana, its production chain has a prosperous effect on the local economy. The bamboo is cultivated on degraded soil, mostly abandoned gold mines. The bikes are assembled in factories in rural areas, in order to create jobs for the rural unemployed youth. The bike joints are connected by wiring fiber drenched in epoxy around the connections, this makes the joints though as steel and guarantees the solid quality of the bamboo bike.

55rk6q,1,2016-10-03,Issue with $redirectID,turbo-cobra,PHPhelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/PHPhelp/comments/55rk6q/issue_with_redirectid/,"So let me put my ignorance out there first.

I'm a journalism major and my advisor roped me into helping a local journalism organization maintain their website knowing I have minimal coding experience saying that it would be a piece of cake, so I have approximately no idea what I'm doing.

I haven't struggled too much, I've gotten several of the pages updated successfully, but I've run into an error that I haven't been able to find a solution for in the last couple hours.

So essentially the majority of what I've been doing is going to the files on the server and opening different master.php files and updating variable information in them so the information the index file pulls shows updated info for this year (example of a corrected page here: http://kypress.com/intern/ )

My issue is on the page http://kypress.com/rateanddatasheet/

I've updated the master.php file which contains the usual date variables I've updated in other pages but I'm not seeing these changes reflected on the page.

This is the entirety of the code in the index.php file for the rateanddatasheet page:

&lt;?php
$relocateid = ""257"";
?&gt;
&lt;?php include(""../site/relocate.php""); ?&gt;

Several of the other pages I've worked on have had index files similar to this, but most include a line above that which collects the data from the master.php file. Here's an example of the code from the aforementioned updated intern page that reflects updated information in the master.php file.

&lt;?php require_once('master.php'); ?&gt;
&lt;?php
$relocateid = ""145"";
?&gt;
&lt;?php include(""../site/relocate.php""); ?&gt;

I tried adding that first line above the code in the rateanddatasheet index file but it just made the page produce an error.

I have no idea what I'm doing and could really use some help.

Thanks!"
55rkqs,7,2016-10-03,"Transference, or: I can't tell if I fucked up the relationship or they did",11dingos,TalkTherapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalkTherapy/comments/55rkqs/transference_or_i_cant_tell_if_i_fucked_up_the/,"TL;DR: former therapist spoonfed me through early sobriety, expressed that he felt I was exceptional, and I had to stop contacting him due to transference and because it would interfere with new therapist.  I think I am causing therapists to flex boundaries a little and that I am fucking up the relationship.

In mid-July, I stopped drinking.  Out of necessity, this involved detox; detox was ugly, and I ended up leaving and then going home to drink.  I had been suicidal leading up to this, but with Librium AND booze on board, I was ready to act.  My immediate urge was to walk the line on nearby highway.  But I felt guilty about doing that to innocent bystanders, so I decided to book a hotel and go there the following day.  I wrote up a bunch of suicide notes, and after I lied to my husband about where I was going, I hopped in an Uber and sent the notes via email and Facebook messenger, then deactivated Facebook and turned off my phone.  Long story short, I'm alive and coming up on 90 days sober.

Leading up to detox, I contacted a former psychiatrist (who also did a little therapy with me).  I had seen him for a year and a half or so, 2012-2013.  He was the first person to compassionately and directly tell me I had a drinking problem.  I trust him and think he's great.  I asked if he knew of any therapists in my neighborhood.  He didn't, but we started a casual email trail wherein it came out that i needed detox, he called me, we talked about it.  Ultimately I did decide to go, about a week later.

So my husband called him the day after my hotel adventure.  The doctor checked his email and found a suicide note from me; we asked his advice on what to do next, and he spoke to my husband at length.  I returned for one final day of detox.

For about a month after detox I was in touch with this psychiatrist pretty much everyday.  I wrote lengthy emails to him, and he called me in the evenings.  I wrote a 40 page inventory and he read it.  I became extremely attached and the transference was intense.  Father figure stuff, not erotic stuff.  

One Friday he sort of pleadingly told me ""You're too incredibly smart and creative to NOT get through this.""  And also ""I don't give a shit about the money; I would see you for free.  I enjoy working with you.  It's really hard to find smart people.  But I just can't fit you into my schedule and provide the twice-weekly therapy I think you need.  Given the speed with which you process, I couldn't in good conscience see you fewer than twice weekly.""

Up to this point he had explained the schedule conundrum and it was sort of an up in the air thing, like ""Let me know if you have ideas.""  I tried throwing some out there, which resulted in the conversation above.

All of this was very painful to me.  For some time I continued writing and talking to him on the phone, and he joked about his ""half-assed therapy"" as my ""not-therapist.""  I was feeling guilty and ashamed of the situation I felt I put him in, and so my emails were carefully written ""gifts,"" I effusively expressed gratitude, and also wrote about and talked these feelings over with him.  He mentioned a few times the liability he was taking on given my blend of suicidality and recent sobriety, as well as the consequent loss of sleep over my situation.

I thought I was done with this, and hadn't emailed him in a month save for a quick celebratory note on 60 days sober - until I started flipping out about seeing the intern I posted about previously.  I emailed not-therapist late at night and in an uproar.  Once I met with the new therapist, I quickly sent a wry addendum about how, ""strangely,"" talking to the intern about this helped.  He sent back a kind of impersonal and clipped response.  

Two days later I was laid off from my very flexible, forgiving work from home job.  I jumped the gun and started looking into disability, so I sent not-therapist an email asking whether he thought disability would be justified and asking him to release my records.  He had told me in the past that I'd have to review them with him because the content could be disturbing or destabilizing.  I suggested I do this with my current therapist due to my ""clearly having trouble detaching.""

When  not-therapist emailed a validating and boundary-setting response, I felt ok about it.  But in the process of all this I have violated the rules of my DBT program and re-opened the intensity of the transference and all the attendant anger, fear, shame, and sadness.  It's also occurred to me that my extreme response to starting with a new therapist might be related.

Why did this happen?  I really feel like I fuck up therapists.  This guy clearly went above and beyond, and I've destroyed his trust or my future ability to see him, probably.

Both he and my previous therapist, the relationship with whom ALSO became fucked up (though for different reasons), left it open ended for me to contact them in the future.  Both have been more than willing to help if I needed anything, and not-therapist has spent significant time helping me on other occasions, in a much more limited way.  I've heard more than once that I am particularly rewarding to work with, and had some kind of fourth-wall breaking experiences when it comes to understanding how my therapists feel about me.

Am I ""breaking"" therapists or somehow coercing them into loosening boundaries?  Am I given leeway because I seem to be able to handle less rigid boundaries?  Why did things get SO fucked up with not-therapist, and why do I STILL feel so shitty?

I can't tell if he did something he shouldn't have and I went batshit, or if I am jut being batshit due to transference."
55s5w6,3,2016-10-04,"integrating a ""conventional"" javascript project into Angular2",Ilance,Angular2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Angular2/comments/55s5w6/integrating_a_conventional_javascript_project/,"I googled around for a bit and didn't manage to find any similar cases to my situation. My teammate bought some pre-built front-end templates. something similar to this: http://www.quackit.com/html/templates/download/bootstrap/business-2/index.html that comes with all the html css and javascript.

I have managed to modularize the htmls into different components along with their css into a new Angular2 project, which was pretty easy to do. However, the pre-bought package also came with many javascript library files (jquery and pre-written animation functions), and the script tags that include those javascript files in the html doesn't seem to be ""taking effect"" in my angular2 project. I have mostly worked as backend dev through my internships, and this is the first time I am the ""main guy"" tackling front-end stuff. I HAVE NO IDEA how to easily make those javascript files work with my angular2 project. I have read that it is not the the proper convention to include jquery functions in angular2 project, but the front-end is rather large, and I am doing this project as a favor for a friend for free. so there is no way for me to rewrite all the jquery functions into something more ""angular2"". Nor do I think it is worth my time to learn how to do such things.

So my question is : is there any easy way for me to integrate the pre-written javascript and jquery files into the angular2 project so the animations works? 

edit:
Hi, after reformulating my question over and over on google, I have found the solution to this problem. https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/4903
basically the script that you want to add to your angular2 project need to be added in the root index.html, because the script tags are all deleted in the component's html"

This line pops into my head sometimes when I'm cruising this subreddit in the most pleasant of ways - it's nice talking shop and joking around with a niche group of people in a similar, and albeit, nerdy field.

This subreddit is a fantastic resource for career advice, school advice, interview and internship questions, and is also a fantastic (and basically the only) place to anonymously vent and joke around about a relatively isolated industry we're all a part of. But I have to say, ya'll are negative as shit sometimes.  

After surfing this subreddit for the past 5+ years, starting at intro to accounting in College, continuing through internships, grad school, and through full time employment, the negativity meter has read strong during the entirety of my tenure here.  I went through each phase of my college and professional career dreading the souless, cut throat, burnout field of public accounting that's consistently illustrated here. No thread was complete without a re-assuring dose of supposed reality that the field I was about to enter was a life-sucking, unrewarding field.

I get it though. Like a wife of 14 years or a 97' Accord you've been stuck driving, it's much easier and cathartic to vent when given the chance as opposed to telling your buds how ""it's the small things that keep you going"", or that ""the trunk space generous and there certainly is a plentiful amount of cup holders."" 

A part of me is thankful I went through each phase with dismal expectations induced by this community, only to be presently surprised that things weren't as bad as people made it out to be. Like everything in life, maybe low expectations in the accounting field is a key part to get by. However, I don't think the accounting field, and more specifically, life working in public is portrayed all that accurately here.

To wrap this incoherent rant up and get to the point, all I want to say is, it's not always that bad. At first I thought I was a loner in the department of people who enjoy their job in the accounting field, but I was once again pleasantly surprised to find a size-able amount of individuals (in different positions varying years of experience) who felt the same as I did. Yes, the work gets stressful. Yes, the hours can get absurd. And like any other white collar job, there's drama, micromanagement, and small, tedious, absurdities that are easy to get worked up about. There are equivalent speed bumps in any career choice, however, I personally think there are a number of things about this job that compensates for the frequently disclosed bullshit that makes public enjoyable and rewarding. Call me crazy. 

I'm fully prepared to get roasted by you all, and I'm fully expecting to be told ""just wait, you'll see"", or ""DAE second year of public"", and ""you're a fucking idiot, mate."" Bring it on strong boys, because it's nothing I haven't seen time and again on this subreddit and in the field. I'll be sure to try and remember to check back in with you all if I get burnt out and realize you were all correct from the beginning, but until then, I'll be doing my best to counteract you debbie downers with some not-so-depressing content.

The doctor took all of Bailey's ideas, and clearly had a power problem. She sucked up to Webber, and was just a bitch. 

I would LOVE to see her come back to the hospital and be the new ortho person. I was discussing this with a few people and we all bounced ideas off of each other. Here is what we came up for a story arc: 

Dr. Barlow (played by Missi Pyle) would be an awesome contrast. Sure, we have the drama with Jo and no one really likes her, however, no one likes Jo becauase of her actions and whiney personality. I think it would be cool to have Barlow show up, and start talking with Webber, assuming he is still chief, and tries to get a job. He says to talk to the new chief, and glances over to Miranda and Ben fighting. 

Barlow is hired even though Bailey puts up a big fight about it. Barlow starts acting like the chief and approving things. Bailey, whom has earned the title of badass has a hard time confronting Barlow. 

Barlow starts to flirt with Owen and Warren. Neither of them are falling for it, but Miranda gets very self scared and worries. Amelia isn't afraid, but the hatred Mer and Ameila have towards Barlow make them bond. 

Barlow is a great surgeon, but tries to overstep, and pisses everyone off. She steals surgeries, she flirts with all the men, she is backstabbing, and she will take credit for everyones work (Talking at lunch and Alex mentions a kid has a rare disease, then tells everyone it was her catch).

I would LOVE to see a character that we hate because we are supposed to hate her. It would be a nice contrast then ""this person is annoying during this arc"" or the fandom split in half like with Izzie (half the viewers LOVED Izzie, other half hated). I want a character that is fun to hate, and really makes Bailey shake because of how rocky the marriage is. Now, we know Bailey has had SIGNIFICANT character growth since we see the flashbacks of her intern year. It would be cool to see the contrast from strong-badass MB to all of a sudden taking crap from only Barlow. 

It would be cool to see the entire cast band together in hatred for someone for a reason other than the whole Penny storyline."
55u4un,2,2016-10-04,My conclusion about College Works Painting after doing research,Eldereon,Scams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/55u4un/my_conclusion_about_college_works_painting_after/,"It all began when a speaker from Western Washington University came into my sociology 101 class, gave a brief speech, then handed out a form to fill out for those who were interested in the internship. I filled it out and later received a call which started with a brief phone interview and I was then scheduled for an informational meeting over video chat. At this meeting an alumni intern laid out what the internship would entail, managing your own company which is financially covered by the College Works company.

I was going to go further into the application process until I did some research into the internship program. There are definitely mixed opinions of this opportunity. Many people say they loved the experience, others say they gained valuable experience in exchange for extremely hard work, others flat out call it a scam or at least scam-like. The parts that turned me off was the many accounts of door-to-door marketing. Managing a company does not in its definition include door-to-door marketing, that gets done by someone else. The alumni who I spoke with at the informational meeting did stress the internship is mostly about sales and marketing, but he failed to say that the vast majority is door-to-door. Some people who say they were in this program said that College Works did not provide any budget for marketing, so they HAD to do door-to-door.

Also, there are numerous stories about unethical and dishonest practices of College Works. These include raising the initial estimate by 5% to offer a 5% discount, the district manager (who is supposed to be your mentor) taking nearly complete control, and 8 hours a day on weekends spent going door-to-door.

Of course the many success stories can't be ignored. There are multiple people who have responded to forum posts about College Works Painting either by an ex-intern or someone who knew one that say they did make a good amount of money and gain valuable experience.

My conclusion of College Works Painting is that the internship is NOT a scam, but, the company is unethical and dishonest. For me, this is unacceptable. I am an honest person, especially when it comes to business. I could not bring myself to do something like raise the price 5% to offer a 5% discount. I also greatly dislike door-salesmen so I do not want to become one of them. Furthermore, I know I will get abuse by most of the people whose door I knock on, and justifiably so. Personally I wouldn't be able to handle that 8 hours a day on weekends. My final point of conclusion is that despite the internship being advertised as a managerial position, the vast majority is actually aggressive marketing, which includes door-to-door and phone calls. If you are OK with a dishonest, unethical company who exaggerates the internship they offer, and are willing to put in way more hours than you normally would, then I believe the College Works Painting internship can work out for you. If you are like me, however, I would stay away from it."

For the past 2 years I worked as a language assistant while living with him. It was okay. The pay is crappy and the work is easy and the school was about a 15 minute train ride from home. It was a good way to get a student visa for a year and make minimum wage. 

This summer I got a really great online job tutoring English. I liked it a lot and it paid really well - 17 dollars an hour. I was meant to start my 3rd year as a language assistant in a new school in October.

With the language assistant program - your school placements are pretty random. You can request a province, which you may or may not get, and you can loosely request a city to be near. But it's totally hit or miss. During the summer I found out that I'd been placed in a school that was about an hour bus ride from home.

Midway through the summer, I was offered a full-time position with my online job. It looked so amazing - good salary, work from home, benefits, etc. I had to turn it down because I'd lose my student visa to stay in Spain if I didn't do the shitty teaching assistant job.

So as the summer dwindled and my starting date for the assistant job grew closer, I began to get anxious and frustrated. The school was only going to make me come 3 days out of the week to fit my commuting more easily, which is very nice, but I'd have to take *2* busses with an hour layover between to get there and basically spend 2 hours commuting one way. That's about ~10 hours spent commuting per week. It's crazy. It's a waste of time.

The assistant job pays 700 euros a month. Commuting will cost about 160. That means I'm earning 540 euros a month. It's nothing. It's awful.

I could make *more money* simply by doing the online tutoring job. I'm having to *give up time and money* to go to this shit job just to keep a visa. It's not even anything I'm interested in: I was placed in a primary school. I want to teach high school. It's just... a total waste of time, I'm getting nothing beneficial out of it, and I'm losing money.


There's a very easy fix for this: in Spain they have something called ""pareja de hecho"" which is similar to a civil partnership. However, there is no linkage of finances, no alimony, no financial risks, it dissolves on its own after 5 years, etc. It's basically a paper you sign telling the government you're living with someone in a serious relationship. It's super easy to get rid of and just.. not a big deal. I'd get a residency card and the ability to live and work in Spain without needing to renew a student visa year after year. I could get a real job and not spend 10 hours commuting a week. 


My boyfriend seemed super against this idea. He's divorced and cowers at the idea of any documented commitment. I tried to talk about it with him but it turned into a huge argument and we haven't discussed it since.


Today was my first day at the job. The commute was a goddamn nightmare. I just got home and I feel like I'm getting back from an exhausting trip. My feet ache, my legs ache. I left the house at 9 AM, it's now 6:30 PM. All for about 40 bucks and a visa. 


I'm going to be 25 soon. I don't want to be working an ""internship"" anymore. I want to go to school, I want to get a real job, I want to be able to afford a new pair of shoes. 


I fucking do not want to ever go back to that goddamn elementary school that takes 2 hours to get to. Fuck it.

I love my boyfriend so much and really do want to stay with him and make a future for myself here in his country. But jesus christ, the only way I can do that is with a Pareja de Hecho and if he's not willing to do it now, then when?

[FTT][sci-fi][Futa][buk]",Cursed_Royalty,sexystories,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexystories/comments/55vgwz/the_coffee_crew_chapter_6_doctor_doctor/,"Debra’s phone call from work was certainly a surprise to Virginia, the sound of the woman’s slightly exhausted tone through the phone’s speaker was both a welcome joy and a concerning worry.



“I’m fine, I promise, I just wondered if there was a doctor that you had in town that knew about your condition?”



Virginia sighed softly as she recanted her previous statement through the cell phone to her friend, “Two. Weeks. Two weeks and you call up asking about my doctor? Not, a ‘Don’t worry, I’m not hooked on drugs or out being kept against my will by some psychopath’, just ‘hey, who knows about your di-’,” Virginia stopped mid-sentence and checked to see if her office door was open. Naturally, it was closed, but still, it probably would not have mattered if it was open and her phone call was playing over the PA system since most of the office now knew about Virginia’s condition. Oddly enough, most of the office paid no mind to it, as if it were normal for most women to have a huge, floppy cock between their thighs, but luckily only one person seems to be teasing her about the incident and that happens to be Kim, the intern, who might or might not have a thing for her. 



“Virginia… You’re spacing out again…” Debra’s voice shook Virginia from her distant thoughts with a bit of annoyance lurking in her tone, “Listen, I just need an appointment with your doc.”



Virginia shook her head as she tried to wrap her head around the request Debra was asking of her. Why? Why her doctor? Why now? Was Debra alright? Every question leading to another as Virginia placed her head in her unoccupied hand as her elbow rested on her desk. “Why do you need to see my doctor?”



“Well, Virginia, let me ask you something…”



There was a long pause on the line, Virginia waited a moment, tension building within as Debra’s side of the phone was silent for longer and longer before Virginia chimed in, “Yes?”



“Vee, have you… Have any of your previous, uh, previous lovers ever, ummm, grown a…”



Virginia tried to piece together what Debra might have been trying to ask her. Grown what? A second head? Horns and a tail? A di-...



“No way,” Virginia’s eyes flew open in astonishment, her heart thundering in her chest as she thought about her friend having a fem-cock just like her own, “no fucking way, Debra. There’s no way you’re going to sit here and tell me you have a fucking cock!”



The line remained silent after Virginia’s exclamation, the mood rising as Virginia ran her hand through her long blonde hair in astonishment, “Oh my God, I made you grow a dick…”



Debra breathed a soft sigh of relief, her tone shifting to one of comfort as she tried to calm Virginia down, “Now Vee, just calm down, I’m sure there’s an explanation for it. Like I said, I think we need an appointment with your doctor to figure this out. Cause anytime I try to look this shit up on the internet its just porn, sex stories, and really… interesting… comics.”



Virginia tried to imagine Debra with a dick, the sight of the athletic, almost muscular, brunette with a hard cock sent a spasm of excitement down Virginia’s spine and right into the tip of her own cock as it nestled comfortably inside her tight slit thanks to the generous amount of medical tape holding it in. Debra simply nodded at the thought as her lips curled into a devious grin, even despite the obvious thought of worry that was lingering somewhere at the back of her mind.



“Okay, her name is Doctor Sophia Winters, she is a really great doctor, and she’ll be very interested in your - condition! I’ll set up the appointment because I really want to be there for you.”



Debra chuckled nervously as Virginia mentioned being at the appointment with her, but a soft sigh of relief slipped from her lips as she heard that the doctor was a woman. She honestly didn’t know how she would have been able to comfortably explain her issues to a male doctor but put the worrying thought out of her head as she thanked Virginia once again and hung up the phone. Her body finally relaxing back onto her living room sofa as she looked down her body to the throbbing bulge that filled her running shorts. The entire ordeal was driving her crazy, she was happy to finally be able to tell Debra, but she silently chastised herself for not having decided to reveal her circumstances earlier. It seemed so much easier now that Virginia knew, almost as if nothing had happened; as if she hadn’t grown a big, throbbing hunk of fuck meat…



Still, Debra smiled softly as she rubbed her hand over the bulge and sighed with a twinge of pleasure shooting up through her body. Soon, she’d be able to see Virginia again, and the idea of being able to show Virginia her cock entered her mind. The idea of how much bigger Virginia would be, they could compare, and maybe Virginia would laugh at how silly Debra had acted.




Only a day had passed since the phone call, Virginia sat in her Jeep just outside her doctor’s office waiting for Debra with a big smile on her face. A glance at her phone told that Virginia had shown up almost thirty minutes early to the appointment, which only made her chuckle as she shook her head at her own silly, giddy enthusiasm to see her friend. Virginia herself had not been to the visit Doctor Winters in a while, her lips letting out a girlish giggle as her thoughts drifted away to the last visit she had with Winters. The contrast of the cool examination table below her and the hot mouth of Sophia Winters wrapped around her thick cock was certainly a reason to visit more often. The good Doctor always insisted on getting a “sample” from the source directly when Virginia visited, two samples actually, sometimes three or four, but no matter how many times Virginia came at the hands (or lips, or tongue, or anything else the Doctor has to offer…) she always left the office exhausted. Even now, she could already feel the medical tape straining against the skin of her thighs, struggling to hold her dick down. Virginia was almost ready to pull her member out for a quick jerk before she was interrupted from her trance-like state by Debra who simply smiled at her friend through the Jeep’s driver-side window. Virginia felt like she had not seen her friend in years, she shrieked with joy as she scrambled to open the door and leaped out to embrace the raven-haired woman as she exclaimed, “Dammit, Debra! You can’t disappear like that on us again! I swear, if I have to hunt you down and beat you to a pulp, I will…”



Debra honestly could not tell if the last part of her friend's threat was in jest or a legitimate concern she should now deal with. They both smiled, Virginia took a quick glance around to check for onlookers, and then pressed her lips firmly against Debra’s as they embraced. The feeling of Virginia’s soft lips against her own sent jolts of electricity, comfort, and pleasure through Debra’s very soul. Their eyes closing as they submitted to one another, Virginia’s hands moving down past Debra’s hips to rest on the brunette’s shapely ass before giving it a firm squeeze. Both girls giggled and Debra softly whispered into her lover’s ear just above the din of traffic a few yards away, “Come now, we can have fun AFTER we figure out why I sprouted a dick.”



Virginia nodded and they broke their embrace, both turning and moving towards the rather large office building that looked like it was being cleared out thanks to Doctor Winter’s brilliant idea of requesting they meet after regular business hours. Virginia led Debra through the main lobby towards a bank of elevators, smiling towards the older man who was sweeping the floor nearby as they waited for the elevator to descend from above. The building itself seemed to be rather comforting compared to what Debra had imagined. If it weren’t for the fact that she was going to see a doctor somewhere above this first floor, she would have mistaken the entire building for an art gallery. Stone sculptures, paintings, and a simple ease of tensions throughout that calmed Debra’s worried mind.



It was not long before Debra and Virginia were walking into the very office of the Doctor they had come to see, the lobby empty, the receptionist already was gone, and the only light on was a distant desk lamp just barely visible from the foyer.



“Doctor Winters?”, Virginia called out.



“Virginia! One moment, I’ll be right there!”, called out a rather sultry voice which dripped with a fading Melbourne accent.



The first surprising thing that Debra saw was the way the Doctor bounded from the lit office with a pair of 2-inch heels like a track star would wearing Pumas, not to mention the fact that the Doctor was wearing a very tight mini skirt that came to her mid-thigh, and if not for the lab coat and stethoscope, Debra might mistake this blonde haired beauty for a supermodel or an actress. She was certainly much different from what she had expected of a Doctor that Virginia might enjoy, the woman before her was far from buxom, in fact, Sabrina might have had more curves, but Winters was more of an elegant beauty. Toned, skinny, but not a rail thin bimbo. Like if Yvonne Strahovski and Nathan Fillion had an illegitimate love child. Debra shook the thought from her head as she quickly made herself look presentable and professional with a back-handed brush of her front.



“Oh my God! Virginia, you look simply ravishing! I haven’t seen you in forever! You haven’t been cheating on me, have you?”, Sophia Winters smiled cheekily as she wrapped her arms around Virginia’s waist and pulled her close, pressing her full, plump lips to Virginia’s and only breaking the embrace after she remembered that they were not alone.



“Terribly sorry! You’re Debra, right?”, Winters turned with a big smile towards Debra, extending her hand to the brunette, “I’m Doctor Sophia Winters, I’ve heard a bit about the circumstances, and I’ll be more than happy to help us all figure this thing out.”



Debra smiled and took the woman’s hand, noting the incredible physique the woman carried. Slender, athletic, yet still curvy. Her bright blue eyes looked like they had been photoshopped into her head, as they sat behind a pair of slender reading glasses that hung gingerly from the bridge of her nose.



“Well, let’s get you to an examination room. Tell me, Debra, when was the last time you and Virginia had sex?” Winters question was posed as she turned back towards the hallway she had just emerged from, moving towards the first door on the right and leading the two women into the room after turning on the light. Debra was a bit taken aback as she blushed brightly and thought about how long it had been.



“Two weeks I believe, maybe three,” Debra answered as she entered the exam room and seated herself on the exam table while Virginia crossed the room and took a seat next to a small desk in one corner.



“My, my, and that was the last time you engaged in sexual intercourse at all?”



Debra’s blushing cheeks shone brighter as she averted her gaze, “No, my last time was two days ago.”



A devious smirk crossed Doctor Winter’s lips as she turned back to Virginia, “Uh-oh, let’s hope you knew about this little escapade.”



Virginia shook her head at the doctor’s jibe, shrugging her shoulders as she spoke, “It certainly is news to me, but I’m okay with it. I certainly don’t own Debra.”



Winters nodded to her Virginia before turning back to the patient, “So, when did you start noticing your symptoms?”



Debra thought a moment before answering, recounting the few days of feverish tossing and turning in bed, the burning need to orgasm, and finally finished with a soft sigh as she told of how she finally grew the courage to inform Virginia after her tryst with her assistant. Winters simply listened, a soft smile on her face as she made notes on a small steno pad, and then when the story was over, she flashed another cheeky smile as she looked to Debra, “Alright, let’s have a look at you, go ahead and strip down.”



Debra nodded, standing and moving her hands to the belt that held up the awkwardly baggy jeans she had worn to hide the very thing she was about to show off. Both Virginia and Doctor Winters waited patiently, watching as Debra slid the baggy jeans down her legs past a pair of compression shorts, and when Debra pushed the thin fabric of the shorts down, she stood up in the middle of the exam room with her already stiff cock hanging lewdly in the air. Virginia stared wide-eyed at the member attached to her friend, it was gorgeous and naturally uncut. Its length held a single throbbing vein that Winters couldn’t help but giggle at. Debra quickly covered herself, at the sound of the Doctor’s giggle, but was quickly reassured.



“My apologies, Debra, I was just remembering the first time I saw Virginia’s cock, and I couldn’t help but compare you two. Well, shall we get started?”



After pulling a pair of examination gloves from her desk and slipping them on, Doctor Winters sat on the small rolling stool and wheeled herself close to Debra’s bare bottom half. Debra said nothing as the blonde beauty briefly examined the shaft of her cock, gently gripping the rod and maneuvering it to different angles before nodding and giving a soft “Hmmm” of interest. Winters nodded softly and then held the she-cock up against Debra’s ab ladened chest, noting quietly that the woman’s pussy was still intact.



“It all still functions normally, yes?”



“Errr… Yes, I mean, I can now pee standing up, but I haven’t had my period since it grew,” Debra sounded like she was answering a simple questionnaire on coffee and not talking about how her dick worked.



“Any sensitivity in either area?” Winters asked as she gently ran her finger over Debra’s slit which caused her to gasp softly in surprise and pleasure.



“Y-Yes. It used to be that my dick was too sensitive to wear clothes, I’d cum just from trying to put on panties,” Debra said as she could already feel her body grow warm and her breath grow quicker from the stimulation. Winters gave a soft, thoughtful nod as she reached up and gripped Debra’s shaft, stroking her thumb along the underside of it as she looked past the throbbing rod to the Brunette’s soft green eyes, the Doctor’s lips letting out a soft purr as she handled the she-cock in one hand, “and now?”



Debra’s whole body tensed up as she was teased, to think that this examination was anything less would’ve been foolish, but still, Debra bit her bottom lip ever so firmly before answering the Doctor’s question, “It’s m-much less sensitive now.”



Winter’s lips cocked a grin as she squeezed her grip about Debra’s shaft and gave her a few firm tugs before letting go. Virginia couldn’t help but stare at the impressive cock that was growing out of her friend, her lips slightly ajar, her eyes wide, but she felt almost relieved at the revelation that her friend was not dying. Debra might have protested at Virginia’s relief, but as Virginia watched the Doctor tease her friend, all she could do was smile and sigh.



“So, Doctor Winters, is the patient going to live?” Virginia asked half-jokingly as Winters rubbed her glove clad thumb over the head of Debra’s cock.



“Hmmm? Oh, yes, of course, she is, but as to how she grew such a splendid thing… No clue,” Winters smiled to Virginia as she stood up, turned, and carefully removed her gloves before moving to make notes on her pad, “The only thing that can be said for certain is that it is a genetic change, in order to find out more I’d need blood samples from both you and Debra, but I can’t even begin to make a detailed guess at what it might be.”



Virginia nodded as she thought for a moment, then turned back to see Debra standing rather uncomfortably in just her shirt and shoes, “Doctor, can I put my clothes back on?”



“Oh not yet, darling, I need a sample from you!”



Virginia chuckled as she remembered the amount of samples that the Doctor usually requested of her, were it not for her curiosity and the fact that Doctor Winters had turned her mischievous grin on her, Virginia might have left the exam room to wait outside, “Since you’re here as well Virginia, you might as well join her.”



It was now Virginia’s turn to blush as she looked to Debra and shrugged her shoulders, “I might have forgotten to mention that she enjoys getting samples from me.”



Debra started to giggle until she felt the warm hands of Doctor Winters wrap about her shaft as the blonde's lips moved close to her own and they began to kiss in a passionate embrace. The feeling of Sophia’s lips against hers reminded Debra of how soft Virginia’s felt when they first kissed, the jolt of sensation coursing through her body was much the same but combined with the soft, slow strokes of the seasoned hand of Doctor Winters, Debra could barely contain herself. Out of the corner of her eyes, Debra could make out Virginia’s body as she stripped her own clothes off. Even as Virginia pulled down her jeans, before having a chance to release the medical tape that held her cock firmly between her thighs, the massive rod decided it was the perfect time to break free from its prison, and Debra watched as the thick slab of fuck stick jumped up into the air.



Virginia quickly pulled the remnants of tape from her shaft before stepping next to Debra and catching Sophia’s attention. The Doctor needed no invitation as she quickly wrapped her hand around Virginia’s throbbing length and began to stroke in tempo with her other hand which had built up a good pace sliding along Debra’s shaft. She worked masterfully as she quickly transferred her kissing lips and exploring mouth from Debra’s assaulted lips to Virginia’s eager pair.



Both of the big dicked women were breathing heavily in a matter of moments, their bodies eager for release as the Doctor’s hands slid feverishly along their stiff rods. Sophia flashed them both a sly smile before dropping to her knees on the sterile tile of the exam room, her eyes glazed with lust as she opened her mouth wide and let her tongue hang lewdly for a moment before slowly moving to Debra’s tight pussy. The feelings of the skilled tongue teasing her slit momentarily was nothing compared to the shockwaves of pleasure that Debra was barely able to manage when Sophia slid her tongue upwards along the bottom of her stiff she-cock. The brunette let out a yelp of ecstasy as she felt her body shake and could already feel her orgasm close at hand. Sophia quickly stopped her assault on Debra only to reach her hand to the base of the saliva moistened shaft and grip tightly. Debra felt her entire body going crazy, she had to cum, why wouldn’t Sophia let her cum? The only answer she received from Doctor Winters was a kiss to the swollen purple head of her cock before moving to slide those same lips down over Virginia’s bulbous head and down along her thick length.



Debra could only pant as she awaited permission to cum, her eyes narrowed into slits as she looked to Virginia who was on the verge of her own orgasm and Sophia showed no signs of letting up as her lips slid along the throbbing shaft. Her throat concave, lips clutching tightly as she kept her grip tight on the base of both shemales cocks. Finally, as if an eternity had passed, Winters sat back on her legs and stuck her chest forward, smiling as she looked up and nodded, “I’ve tortured you enough, you both may cum now.”



Virginia and Debra’s hands both shot to their own cocks, gripping them tightly and stroking furiously as they moaned out into the exam room before shooting thick streamers of cum into Doctor Winters’ open mouth. They both sighed heavily and watched in awe as the blonde beauty kneeling before them tried her best to catch every drop, but failing miserably and only succeeding in coating her face in a generous amount. When both loads were finished Sophia quickly stood and moved to her desk, retrieving two specimen cups into which she shoveled the hot cum into with a hungry gaze. Debra and Virginia however simply leaned back against the exam table, cocks hanging lewdly in the air, and panting as they both kissed one another passionately.



Debra felt as though this was exactly what she had been missing, the touch, the scent, the sight of Virginia. She felt so happy being close to the woman whom she had only been around for a few months, but still, it was a perfectly content happiness she felt. Debra pulled her lips from Virginia’s as Sophia turned back to them, “Now, now, are you two ready to start without me? Or can I join in as well?”



Sophia giggled as she moved towards the pair and pushed Debra onto her back, taking charge as she whispered into the brunette’s ear, “relax and enjoy the show, Virginia and I will take good care of you.”
Without more warning than those few words, Sophia reached between them, gripping Debra’s steadily hardening cock, and angled it upwards as she slowly slid herself down onto the she-cock. Sophia’s lips opened wide as she let out a staggered moan, her body shuddering from the first few inches as Virginia moved behind the pair. Slowly at first, Debra watched as Sophia’s body gently undulated against her own body, their eyes gazing longingly into one another as Sophia began to speed up her bouncing. Virginia watched the two with earnest before moving behind Winters and positioning her thick she-cock between Debra’s thighs, pressing the bulbous, cum-covered tip of her cock into her friend’s tight pussy ever so slowly. Debra’s eyes shot wide open as she felt Virginia’s dick enter her, she felt as though her entire body were now complete, as if before this something had been missing, and all she could do in this moment of exquisite pleasure was to moan loudly as she grabbed Sophia by the hips and thrust up hard into her.



Sophia, Debra, and Virginia were now a single, sweaty, moaning, thrusting, undulating entity of sexual desire. Sophia’s body was nothing more than a sex toy for Debra who was once again on the edge of yet another exquisite orgasm as Virginia’s cock pounded her tight slit hard and fast. Nothing romantic, nothing passionate, this was animalistic. Debra groaned and moaned, gnashing her teeth as she fought off her impending orgasm for a while longer. Virginia, however, was enjoying every moment as she reached up to Doctor Winters’ ass and gave it a hearty slap which resounded in the exam room like a gunshot followed by a squeal of excitement from Sophia who rode Debra’s cock a bit faster.



Debra let out a primal cry of lust as she thrust up into Sophia hard, pressing herself deep into the Doctor as she began to cum and cum. Debra could feel the hot waves of sperm splashing against the insides of the blonde bombshell riding her and then could only marvel at the sensation of the hot seed overflowing out onto her shaft as Sophia stopped her bouncing to experience an orgasm of her own. Virginia was moments behind the couple in front of her as they all cried out, Debra’s already tight slit was now constricting around V’s fat cock as it pounded in and out, milking the fem-cock for everything it had. With a grunt and one last hard push, Virginia began to empty her own seed deep into Debra who was now simply panting and moaning in exhaustion atop the exam table.



“My goodness, surely you two aren’t exhausted already? I was hoping for a Round Three,” Winters chuckled through heavy breaths as she slid a hand up into her wavy blonde tresses and pushed them back behind her ear.



Virginia smirked as she knew exactly what was to come next with a threat like that, her hands quickly shot to Sophia’s toned thighs, lifting her body off of Debra and on to her own as she held the Blonde against her chest and positioned herself so that her cock pressed against the Doctor’s tight asshole. Debra slowly regained her own strength as she sat up, noticed the strategically spread body of Sophia as she was held by Virginia, and with one hand wrapped around the base of her cock for stability, she stood up and pressed the tip of her own fuckstick against Sophia’s tight slit.



“W-w-wait a minute, Virginia, remember what happened l-last time. T-t-take it slow, please, Virginia. Please!”



Virginia’s and Debra’s eyes met and they both grinned as Virginia dropped the Doctor onto their cocks, impaling the blonde ruthlessly as Sophia could only howl in a mixture of pleasure and pain. They had only gone in a few inches, but Virginia had good enough sense not to force too much into her playthings all at once, and with a good deal of teamwork from Debra, both shemales gripped their new sex toy and began to thrust into her hot, begging holes.



Sophia herself was astonished at the sexual abilities that the two women buried inside her possessed. Their hips thrusting wildly and powerfully, their cocks harder than before they had cum the first time, and not to mention the fact that they were unstoppable made her mind explode with ecstasy as she cried out in lustful bliss,“Oh! Fuck! Yes, more! Please use me!”



The two cocks hammered their way in and out of Sophia’s tight slit and ass, pumping vigorously as they both moaned with every thrust into the ever tightening holes. Debra’s hips were shaking more from her legs’ lack of strength than from her willing them to thrust forward, she felt as though she were almost at the end of her abilities. Debra desperately wanted to cum but did not know if her legs would last long enough to let her. Virginia felt much the same, but she was used to the endurance sessions that Doctor Winters put her through. Debra groaned louder and louder with every thrust into Sophia’s tight slit as her body urged her on into another orgasm, the slow building of pressure in her body felt like it was about to erupt as she felt Sophia’s body instinctively tighten around her invading dick. Sophia’s and Debra’s eyes met for a single moment, Sophia’s face riddled with uncontrollable pleasure as she gripped Debra’s shoulders tightly, pushing her nails into the brunette’s skin.



When Sophia shrieked out her cry of pleasure, tightening every bit of her body in orgasmic spasm, neither cock was able to hold back the flood of seed that was bursting forth from their tips. Debra was the first to cum, pushing her cock as deep as it would go into Sophia’s body, pressing firmly against her cervix as her gooey white cum filled the Doctor’s womb. Virginia was only seconds behind as she pressed her body hard against Sophia’s, pushing their bodies against Debra’s, and all the while filling Sophia’s tight asshole with a torrent of hot sticky cum.



All three women laid against each other as they breathed heavily, panting lewdly as they came down from their ecstatic high. Debra’s body felt completely numb as she held Sophia’s body against her own, she was surprised that she hadn’t collapsed from how tired her legs were, but it seemed that Virginia was helping her in that endeavor. As if she had not just been filled to the brim by two huge cocks twice, Doctor Sophia gently pressed back against Virginia, letting Debra’s cock slip from her, and then gently eased Virginia’s cock from her ass before quickly moving towards her desk and pulling out a pair of panties which she slipped on promptly. The two shemales watched in awe as the Doctor quickly flashed them a smile after writing a quick line on her notepad, “Growth does not impair mobility or hinder sexual performance. I believe we should get this tested to see if it is indeed something contagious or if this particular condition targets certain subjects. Seeing as how I’ve been exposed to Virginia for a while, I don’t think this is something we need to worry about spreading like wildfire, but just in case. Debra, Virginia, please remember to wear condoms, just to be safe.”



The matter-of-fact tone in Doctor Winters’ voice threw Debra and Virginia off guard, making them both erupt into a fit of exhausted giggles before standing and dressing. After their “thank yous”, schedules for follow-ups, kisses, and “goodbyes”, Debra and Virginia both walked from the office hand-in-hand with soft sighs of enjoyment slipping from their lips. “My goodness, I didn’t think I’d have that much fun at a Doctor’s Office.”



Virginia smiled at Debra’s comment, gently rubbing her thumb over the back of Debra’s hand, “Now, you’ll just have to tell the rest of the gang about your ‘new toy’,” Virginia snarkily chuckled as she gave Debra a sideways glance. Debra stopped in her tracks a moment before looking to Virginia with a soft gaze of worry before dispelling it when she saw Virginia’s warm smile, Debra’s lips curled into a smile as she nodded and continued walking, “I’m sure Barbara will be more than happy to have a second dick around.”"

The seamstress I worked with also works at the Alfred Angelo where I got my dress. She called them to get a quote for me and they quoted 314.36 but she said that's an estimate because they have to see me in the dress to get a better idea. So I  am going tomorrow to get an exact quote. Finally, the seamstress said her and husband can do it for $275 out of their house. That price seems amazing to me. Would it be too risky to do it that way?

When I first came to college, I knew I wanted to major in something with business, but wasn't sure what yet. I was also a bit of a slacker, because I was under the assumption that if I got C's, it wouldn't matter because I would have my deree, so until I wised up, my GPA took a beating. Accumulative is 2.88. I try to stay optimistic about it. 

Anyway, I decided accounting because when I took Principles 1, I kinda liked it. I liked the organization aspects among other things and recieved a B+. Knowing I wanted to major in accounting, I took a notoriously tough teacher who teaches two classes at my University which are Cost accounting and Principles 2. Knowing I had to take Cost with her, I decided to see what she was like, and it was very tough. Ended up with a B-, but many people struggled. She made her tests very hard. 

Moving on, I joined Accounting Association and Pi Sigma Epilon, which is a business frat at my university. Here is where things got kind of upsetting. When I talked to teachers, people in the industry, etc, they all shoved CPA and public accounting down my throat, and more or less scoffed at my accumulative GPA, saying it would be VERY hard to get anywhere with my GPA.

I am taking steps to bring it up, and always on the lookout for internships. I've even had a few interviews, but I was turned down. Is there hope for me? I always thought working at a small firm, doing things I would like such as audit or something else, but people make it sound like it's inferior. Not only would it cost me so much more money to even get the credits to sit for the CPA, I would have to find time to study, and I work two jobs to pay for tuition.

What do you guys think?"

Hi,

I just wanted to reach out with a few important dates for our intern/full-time Product Engineer application process:
Wed 5 Oct - Mon 17 Oct: Submit coding exercise
Mon 10 Oct: Remote technical interview sessions begin for students who pass the coding exercise
Applications are rolling and we have limited spots to fill, so submit as early as possible to maximize your chance of selection.

A few students have asked me about resources to help prepare for a software engineering internship: I highly recommend all of the 'classic seasons' of Destroy All Software, React Redux w Dan Abramov, and Protocol Oriented Programming with Swift for some good lessons on pragmatic things like testing practices, design patterns, and managing data flow that you're less likely to hear about in academic courses.

Reach out to me, John, or Nicole (cc-ed) if you have any questions about Fin or our interview process.

55wobc,13,2016-10-04,Environmental Science VS Environmental Engineer Undergrad Degree,Jamin_Out,environmental_science,https://www.reddit.com/r/environmental_science/comments/55wobc/environmental_science_vs_environmental_engineer/,"Hi there!

I'm a 2nd year Environmental Science Major at the University of Guelph thinking about the future. My future career prospects are working as an environmental consultant specializing in water and soil remediation.

As I've been looking around at qualifications for jobs as far as undergrad degrees go, I've been seeing a lot of companies wanting more environmental engineers opposed to /just/ an environmental science degree.

I want to ask the opinion of everyone on this sub a few questions:

1. Am I able to get a decent paying job that I am able to work my way up in with an environmental science degree and not an environmental engineering degree?

2. Am I still able to apply for jobs that are listed as ""Junior Environmental Consultant"" even though in the requirements they say ""Hydrologist, Environmental Engineer, or a degree relating to these fields""?

3. Am I able to apply for jobs that are listed as ""Junior Environmental Engineer""?

4. What are some good companies that will look for ""Environmental Science"" students over ""Environmental Engineering"" students?

5. What are some tips for an undergrad student trying to find an internship?

Thanks in advance anything would really help,

Thank you!"
55wqvv,29,2016-10-04,"I was a great Christian,",OberionSynth,exchristian,https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/55wqvv/i_was_a_great_christian/,"This'll probably be very long, but I have no one to share this story with. All my friends and family are religious and if they found out I wasn't anymore, I don't want to know what would happen. 

To start off, I deal with anxiety disorders (generalized and social) on a daily basis. I also have cycles of major depressive disorder. I'm also about as homosexual as it gets. I've known all of these things since I was around 15. 

I grew up in a very religious household. My parents are very involved in ministry (though they change churches every few years because they're never good enough for them). Growing up, my dad was an associate pastor at our church. Because of this, I was often forced to go to church, youth group and read the Bible and do Bible studies on a daily basis. My education was also 100% Christian-focused (which means I tend to struggle in my college currently as I'm basically having to forger all the shit I was taught.) and taught stuff like creationism and all of Christian history, and pretty much avoided anything else. I was home-schooled because my parents didn't want me to be corrupted by public schooling. I'm like 95% positive that that choice caused my social anxiety to skyrocket. 

Because of all this constant barrage of religion, I really wanted nothing to do with it. I never prayed, I never listened to Christian music, I never read the Bible unless forced. I remember clearly though, I was told I had to read one chapter of the Bible a day. They never asked which chapter I read, though, so I always just read the book of Philemon over and over again because it was only one chapter. I was forced to go to church on Sundays and on Sunday nights for youth group. I had no friends at church because I had no idea how to make friends because I didn't grow up around anybody but my parents. 

Growing up, I was always taught that homosexuality was an abomination and that I need to find a wife and form a great Christian family. Not sure why homosexuality was always focused on so heavily by my parents (Oh, how disgusting it is! Oh, how horrible it is that they want to have rights!), but funnily enough I turned out to be gay. Lord, the amount of damage my parents did just regarding this subject is enough to make me hate myself. Which I did, for a long time.

Around the age of 15, there was a huge scandal and my dad ended up being fired from our church. I'm not gonna go into specifics in case somebody I know ends up reading this (which I doubt, but you can never be too careful) but it ended up with me dealing with some major anxiety and depression. At one point, I stopped my schooling for a month and a half because I just didn't want to do anything but sit in my bed and listen to music for an escape. 

At this time, I was still convinced that I was attracted to women. I started considering myself bisexual, or pansexual depending on what I was feeling at the time. (It was all a lie anyway, so I don't think it mattered much to me at the time lol). Still, my parents didn't know and thought that I was their perfect little Christian child, who was going to give them a great, Godly daughter-in-law and grandchildren. 

A little while after the whole indecent at our old church, we found a new one. My parents started going to this church on a regular basis, and I was dragged along. This time, however, I actually enjoyed going to church. I had met a few people in the youth group and made good friends with them (I'm still great friends with some of them to this day.). We went on a couple trips, like bowling and to Busch Gardens and all these other places. I had me a good little group of friends. I was still awkward as all hell because of being home-schooled and my anxiety, but I was making pretty good progress with getting out of those things. 

I believe I was 17 at the time when we all went on a trip to a youth conference in another state. This was my second time going, and I was excited to be able to go on a trip with these people. Well, there were services every night or so. At one of these, I remember feeling so emotionally overwhelmed because they were talking about going to the altar to be healed. Now, me being stricken with anxiety, depression and homosexuality (which I believed to be a horrible thing because of how my parents thought of it), I went up. 

That night they did an altar call. Perfectly timed while everyone was all emotional with the music playing and ""being healed"". I raised my hand. I gave my life to Jesus, hoping that he would make something out of me. Spoiler alert, he didn't. 

After this conference, I had gained a little more confidence. I was starting to be myself around people. I went to one of my friend's birthday parties and they invited me to go to this weekend event at the other church campus (about an hour away). The event was basically a weekend thing where you could see what it was like to be a part of the church's internship-like program. It was a two year program where you would learn how to be a disciple (slave away for the church), get your degree (at an unaccredited, crappy school) and learn what it means to follow God (we had a class like once a week). I went to this event, and I ""felt called"" to go to this program. And by felt called, I mean that the pastor who runs the program was very convincing. And it was cheap and since my family was pretty poor at the time, I figured I wouldn't be able to get into a regular college. I know now that I could've gone to community college for a lot cheaper price than I went to this school, but again I was sheltered and didn't know much about the world. 

I spent two years in this program. I learned about the Bible, and how to be a disciple. I went into the program one way and came out a completely different person. A true Christian, I would say. It took a couple months for me to all into the brainwashing, I guess, because I spent the first few months angry about how I was always forced to do things for the church staff while they sat in their church offices and napped the day away or talked about their upcoming weddings or dinner events. It was constantly drilled in my head that I need to have a ""servant's heart"" which I eventually believed. 

Now, these two years were a roller coaster for my anxiety and depression. I eventually told some people that I trusted (my ex-best friend, who turned out to be a self-centered asshole, and two of my pastors) that I was dealing with anxiety and ""dealing"" with homosexuality. Basically, I was told that I wasn't believing in God enough, that I wasn't trusting him enough. Because God could heal me, he just wasn't for some reason. Because I wasn't trusting him enough, they said. I didn't have enough faith. I wasn't praying enough. 

I didn't tell them that I would pray every night until I was on the verge of tears for God to heal me of these problems. I prayed for a lot of things, and I wholeheartedly believed that God was going to provide me with these things.

Spoiler alert: He didn't. I was still depressed. I was still anxious. I was still gay as hell, though I pretend to like a girl every once in a while so nobody was suspicious. My pastors were very concerned with my sexuality, and set ""boundaries"" so that I wouldn't ""get hurt"" or ""hurt anyone."" I wasn't allowed to be alone with any youth students (I was a youth leader at the time) and one of my pastors even accused me of being involved with one of my friend's brother (he was openly gay). At the time, I had never even met the man as he lived in Florida. Their response to my anxiety was ""trust God"" and ""don't go to any doctors or anything because God can heal you."" 

I believed them, and since most of my anxiety was caused by people at the church it only got worse. I considered suicide a few times and I was cutting. Again, more boundaries were set and I was told I need to find an accountability partner. I never did because I thought it was a stupid idea. 

Eventually, this program ended and I was offered an internship at the church. I was still a super-Christian at the time and I accepted, believing that God had called me to do the internship. Which is what the pastor said anyway to make sure that I accepted. I was to be their video producer and whatnot (basically make any videos the church would play and whatever shit any of the staff needed at the time but didn't want to do themselves.) 

That internship was the most stressful time of my life. I hate the way that church is run and I never want to go back. I was thrown under the bus many times for things that were not my fault, but since the staff are fucking afraid of the lead pastor I was given the blame. And this always happened in their secret staff meetings so I could never defend myself. Luckily, another intern was able to attend the meetings and she would let me know what they were saying about me (and the other interns.) 

Basically, in this year I found out the pastors were treated like celebrities. If anything minor inconvenienced them they threw fits and yelled at the staff. It was crazy, I'm not even sure why I stayed at that internship as long as I did. I guess I didn't want to be seen as a quitter, because I had made it that far. 

I considered quitting several times, however. But I eventually made it out of the internship. I moved back to my parents house an hour away, but I was still expected to drive an hour to the campus every Sunday because ""God needed me to serve."" I had no say in this apparently, and if I declined to serve I was given a talking to. 

In August, I was given the opportunity to go to our church's conference for free. I went, because why the hell not? I was still believing, and figured it would be a great experience. Well it was. I was doubting my faith at the time but all the great music and people and messages really fired me up and I raised my hand again at an altar call. That night I was like ""fuck"" because I realized what had just happened. It happened the exact same way when I first ""got saved.""

Wanting to be a good Christian again, I started actually reading the Bible this time. And not just in the context of the single chapters I was reading, though. I would compare it with the whole Bible to make sure I was getting the full message. I realized that I had never fully seen the Christian morals and my own morals. I twisted what the Bible said to support my own beliefs. I was fine with abortion being legal, I was ecstatic when gay marriage was legalized. I had to keep these thoughts secret for fear of being seen as a sinner or a bad Christian. But the more I thought about it, the less I cared about that. 

While reading, contradiction after contradiction came up. Nothing made sense, and I realized just how horrible and genocidal the Christian God is. Wait, what? This is the book I got my morals from? Maybe I really should have read this book all those years ago. Maybe I wouldn't have fallen for all the emotional manipulation that churches perform to get people saved. 

While this was happening, I was still dealing with having to drive an hour every week to be at practices and Sunday services. My car is older than I am (I'm 20, currently) and I was tired of the stress that it was putting on my car so I started declining stuff. Again, was talked to but I eventually stopped caring. 

It was around this time that the [events of my first post happened.](https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/4wzs3y/incredibly_frustrated_with_so_called_christians/) tl;dr my current best friend (and former co-intern) ended up being outed as gay and kicked out of the church pretty much

After this, I had had enough and I told my team leaders that I was leaving. I gave some bullshit excuse that I needed to align myself with God, but really I was just tired of the bullshit. I gave my leaders a few more Sundays to find people to cover me (I didn't want to leave with a bad reputation because I still have friends there and I know how badly the staff talks of people that leave and I didn't want my friends to have to deal with that.). My last Sunday going to that church was almost a month ago. Oh, what a stress that was relieved when I walked out of that church and never came back. I cut communication with most of the people there. That was easy because nobody ever really gave a shit about me anyway. A few people contact me now and then, but I won't respond if its anything to do with church work. I really only talk to one of my friends from the church now, though I'm still close with most of the other interns (there were five of us in total.)

I officially considered myself agnostic shortly after I left the church for good. Being outside of that church, it's so easy for me to see how manipulative and fucking crazy they are. I went to another church for a little bit, but eventually stopped because I was only going so my parents wouldn't question anything. 

All of this stuff added up in my head. The fact that God never seemed to care about my issues and how nothing seemed to make sense eventually made me turn away from Christianity. I still suffer from anxiety and depression, but at least now I feel no guilt about being gay. I'm out to a few people, but not my parents. I still live with them while in college and I'm just not willing to deal with the consequences of telling them. They might kick me out, they might not. I'd rather not face that risk. 

After deconverting, I realized I was much more confident in myself. I wasn't relying on some deity to protect me, I was responsible for my own life. I applied to college. I may not get my dream job but I'm gonna try my best. My anxiety and depression have lessened a ton. I'm openly gay for the most part and even talking to someone currently. He's cute af so we'll see how that goes. Haha!

All in all, my experience with religion has been an interesting one. I'm sorry if this story made no sense or if I went off on tangents and what not. I tried to keep it as short as possible, but a lot of shit went down in my life around the same time and I couldn't keep track of all of it. Thanks for reading this, I needed to get it off my chest. I love this community, it really helped open my eyes to what Christianity really is. It was me finding this subreddit that really helped me deconvert, and I'm better mentally for it. Thank you guys :) "

55x3tn,2,2016-10-04,Job Search,Holdmuhdiik,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/55x3tn/job_search/,"As I am approaching my last two semesters at my university, I am beginning to wonder if it is about time to start applying for a job. I will be graduating in May. My current GPA is 2.97, and am hoping to just cross the 3.00 threshold. 

Currently, I have an internship setup with Grant Thornton but this will only be viable if I do have the 3.00 GPA. 

I guess my question would be should I wait until after this semester to start a job search, or start now and possibly pass up on the internship opportunity. 

I am also looking to get my 30 hours extra for the CPA but I do not know if I want to do this at my current college (which would involve moving back 2 hours), or live there and try to do some sort of online program for the last few hours. 

This would be in DFW area if it helps! "
55x7gr,7,2016-10-04,"I [25M] am on the right path career wise, but I'm also a ""kissless virgin"" - how should I address this?",asdfbiohjnfg,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/55x7gr/i_25m_am_on_the_right_path_career_wise_but_im/,"I've always thought I'm a little asexual, or at least, I never felt a huge urge to go out and get laid. As sad as it sounds, I'd just masturbate and that was enough for me. I'll put it this way - I've been to less than a handful of parties. Getting me to hang out is like pulling teeth.

A lot of not going after girls was probably fear of rejection. I've fallen (meaning legitimately fallen, past thinking ""she's hot"") for maybe 4-5 girls, and I always got in my own head with each of those girls (including one, currently) to the point that I don't go for them. As I've gotten older, it feels like the ""margin of error"" gets tighter and tighter - in other words, I need to be more and more ""sure"" of something before I go for it. People (reasonably) assume at age 25 that you've had multiple partners and are maturing in your relationships. Meanwhile, I haven't even had one, and I'm starting to think: ""why bother""? I want one now, more than ever, but I feel I'd disappoint my partner sexually and with my general social inexperience.  I also feel embarrassed to admit this to anyone, especially guys, because I'm then viewed as inferior, in a way.

To be clear, I am confident in my social ability, but I have a low tolerance for it - or at least certain situations. It's hard to explain. I feel a lot of internal anxiety, but I can talk to people very easily - in fact I'm not intimidated at all in 1 on 1 talks, regardless of gender... it's going out to bars, parties, events, etc. that really gets me anxious. I've been told by my friends and a girl who expressed interest in me that I'm very easy to talk to, but I lock up way more when I'm in groups. I actually enjoy 1 on 1 talks with friends and girls, and don't find that hard.

Career wise, college and now grad school have been an awakening. I didn't have a lot (almost nothing) going for me socially outside of school.  I never really made plans or accepted plans with anyone to do anything. I know that by doing that I locked myself out of many fun times and opportunities. So, I focused on school. I got a 4.0 in undergrad and am now at a good law school doing well. I've gotten great internships and I have a good chance at landing really solid jobs. Deep down, I think my effort in school has been my way of proving to myself that I'm not ""worthless.""

I'm now in my final year of grad school. I'm about to head into the real world, once and for all. I feel prepared mentally/intellectually/career wise and confident in that aspect, but I still haven't climbed the romantic mountain. 

It's become more and more of a source of shame for me. I had an amazing girl this year who I've talked with almost daily for months and months in depth. She confessed her feelings to me 2 months back. I didn't feel a heavy attraction to her despite her being attractive in so many ways - smart (top 5 in our class smart, on a competitive grading curve), physically attractive, and emotionally attractive. We talked for 6 hours on the phone and I laid basically everything out for her beyond admitting I'm a virgin. I told her my fears, basically everything. It was one of the best talks I've ever had and I admired her for being brave enough to confess her feelings.

Instead, I've fallen head over heels for a girl who's teasing me that has a boyfriend. My hunch is I specifically go for girls I can't get because I'm scared of actually having a girlfriend and exposing my inexperience... even though this girl really seems like she wouldn't give 2 shits about my lack of it. Still, I feel like she'd get tired of me.

**Where do I go from here? I still don't feel a ""need"" to go for the girl who confessed her feelings to me, but I'm wondering if that's because of fear that I can actually get her, or if I'm simply not interested despite her being great.**
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I've really improved the past few years school and career prospects wise, but put my social life and romantic life totally on the back burner. I denied a girl who is incredibly interesting and compatible, and I think it might be out of fear of exposing my lack of romantic experience. I never felt a strong attraction to her but didn't view her as purely platonic either. What are my next steps to take in my social/romantic life?"
55xgyv,18,2016-10-04,I created a Spreadsheet which graphs my monthly spending by category and a pie chart of my total allocations of my spend per year.,GBHYTFVNJU,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/55xgyv/i_created_a_spreadsheet_which_graphs_my_monthly/,"Reddit's extensive spreadsheet collection motivated me to create a spreadsheet.  Hopefully mine will motivate others!


I just graduated college mid December 2015 and was lucky enough to make some connections though my internships to land a job and start immediately after graduating.  I have been pretty good with money in the past, but I wanted to see where my money was actually going.



I started off creating a basic budget to see what I could afford and started using Mint to help me track.  Since then I decided I wasn't really looking at Mint much so I created this spreadsheet with my basic Excel knowledge.  I do, however, still use Mint to track spend by category so I can fill in the cells at the end of the month. 



I created this spreadsheet near the end of May and back filled the information.  As of now, I have all 9 full months of 2016 and I think I am doing pretty good.  A few big notes on the spreadsheet- I opened a checking account which gives me 3% interest and moved most of my money into it (hits on spreadsheet in March and April).  I still have my other account which only has what I need to live per month and pay all my bills and fluctuates at around $250 at the end of every month.  I do not include this account on my spreadsheets because the spend is broken up in the cells.  



I just bought a used car last Friday so the debt is on the account for September, but I do not have the value of the vehicle shown as of yet.  My Dad gave me a loan when I graduated to help me out with an initial emergency fund for the first year as long as I paid him back with interest by the end of the year.  I am thankful he did this for me, but I haven't been financially dependent on him since I was 16 and bought my first car so it was stressful for me.  I just paid him off in full as of yesterday and it feels good to get that off my chest!   Also not included are my assets such as furniture, clothes, electronics in my apt because I do not wish to check the values of this every month due to the time it would take.  I plan on calculating the values every 6 months and then including it just in the net worth graph.  



Each year will be a new spreadsheet using the same form so I can create a 'Data' tab with a compounded breakdown of my spend over my lifetime. All cells that are editable are indicated with a gray 0's and then you enter a value which turns it black.  Any cell that has black text will auto populate using the formulas I created.  It's still pretty basic, but I wanted to share because than what is typically shared on here and it may give some others ideas for tracking.  



I am more than open to suggestions on how to make this better!  Hope you enjoy my hard work creating this [Screen Grabs of Spreadsheet!](http://imgur.com/a/1E8M1)

----------
Edit: 3% cash back was a local credit union.  I would check out the rates if you have any in your area.  Even if they don't have something this high, typically they CUs have better loan rates too.  As I mentioned I just bought a used car, look out a moderate loan- dealership offered me 4.25% for a 3 year contract, my national Bank offered me 4.5%, a different local CUs rate was 2.49% for the same 3 years.  Plus, it will drop to 2.24% after 6 months when I opened a checking account and had my loan taken monthly straight from the account.  All i do is auto pay that amount into into the account each month.

----------
Edit #2: I worked on the spreadsheet straight after work until now.  All personal data is cleared and I added a lot more columns to fit other peoples needs!  I still need to verify all of the new formulas and also still make sure the graphs display correctly.  I will continue to work on this tomorrow, but if everything works out I think I should be able to add the spreadsheet tomorrow night!  Worst case, it doesn't work perfect and I'll need to more editing, but I will get it up sometime this weekend.

I am in search of a part-time job, preferably in North County San Diego, although I can travel if needed. I am very dependable, hard-working, and resourceful. I have had many jobs in different fields and now I am finishing my Bachelor's degree. I am a veteran and 27 years old. I would love to work for someone that can be somewhat flexible to my school and internship schedule (it is my last semester, so possibly full-time after). I also do not want to go back to working minimum wage jobs because I know my full capacity as an employee. 

I have applied and am constantly applying for jobs from different resources, however I have not had much luck. So I am reaching out to this great community (with a throwaway) and hopefully something comes up. I can guarantee you that I am trustworthy, a very quick-learner and would be an excellent candidate for your team. I am not homeless or need of quick cash, I rather be a great fit for the right company. 

My experiences include, but not limited to: logistics, management, driving, merchandising/B2B sales, coaching, great computer skills (office, mac, etc), among many other things. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this and have a good day.

I know I shouldn't but I can't help myself.,play_time_is_over,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/55ymif/my_ex_wants_to_get_back_together_i_know_i/,"I broke up with her 5 months ago. Telling myself once I was rid of her I could be free and take over the world.

The first 3 months I was motivated. Lost a lot of weight, signed up to the gym, got my back belt, rebuilt broken relationships, quit playing video games completely, started getting high distinctions at uni and lined up an internship. That was the first 3 months, but all I could remember was how fucking cold and lonely it was.

The reason I dumped her was because she didn't get on well with my family, I felt she was holding me back from focusing on my studies 100% and she was very manipulative.

I slept with one girl on tinder since I broke up with her and it was terrible, I hated it. After that I gave up on chasing women all together. I got top marks in my studies but it didn't make me feel anything. Life was so empty I got on anti-depressants.

Now it's 5 months since I broke up with her and honestly I don't even feel like I'm alive. Each day is a walk along the path to nowhere. I try not to waste my time, I try to be productive and creative, however my projects seem to just go in circles with no real destination. I don't care about social media or socializing at all. I just don't care about anything, and it's hard going from day to day and trying to be productive, applying for jobs, working on uni projects, resisting the urge to play video games and going to the gym... yet these last 6 weeks I've been a complete fucking zombie.

Then I got a text from her. Saying how she's been hurting so much these last 5 months, how she's tried and tried but hasn't been able to find a connection with anyone. How she just feels like I'm her soul mate and she just wants to drive her car off a bridge. I had no idea honestly, she put on a good act. 

Then by a twist of fate she gets on the bus with me, the first time ever, and sits next me. We talk, I ask her how she's been, she suggests we get coffee. We talk more, apparently she hasn't slept with any other guys for 5 whole fucking months. Basically just waiting for me to see if I change my mind. Which I find hard to believe because she is quite attractive and has had a lot of offers. Today... woke me up. Talking to her woke me up, I feel like I've snapped out of it - I feel like my reason is to be with her.

All my friends and family hated her though. The thing is, I'm growing more and more distant with my family anyway, and I haven't made any new friends, and I only see my friends once a fortnight. I feel like getting back with her is wrong for 101 reasons except one major reason. It would make both her and I happy.

I haven't met anyone with the same values as me like she has, I haven't found anyone close to her sense of humour, we have an undeniable connection that I can't feel with anyone else. I haven't found anyone else willing to be 100% on my side. I've never felt closer to anyone than her, she knows me completely. I know I'm going to get myself into a world for shit, but we're going to the beach this weekend... I just don't care what everyone else thinks, my own happiness is more important to me."
55ypdr,2,2016-10-05,Apple's non-mobile OSes are dead. We need to get over it.,tombiscuit,macsysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/macsysadmin/comments/55ypdr/apples_nonmobile_oses_are_dead_we_need_to_get/,"I'd like to write a longer blog post about this over at http://mackungfu.org. Alas I just don't have time but I think it's something that needs to be out there and that we need to start discussing as a real possibility – if not a certainty. So I'm going to put on my Gruber hat and give it a try here. 

Despite the name change, which is a cursory fresh coat of paint if ever there was one, Apple clearly has it in its sights to kill off macOS within maybe 5-10 years. *They might not even be aware of this yet themselves.*

The evidence:

* Apple partnered with IBM recently. They're flogging iOS, not macOS. It's about mobile and nothing else. 

* iOS is maturing into a desktop OS with the iPad Pro. It's nowhere near there yet but unless you're myopic you can't fail to spot a clear trajectory. Notably, this is where Apple's hottest software engineers are working. 

* Most but not all key new features added to macOS/OS X in recent years have been there to prop-up iOS devices/mobile. Continuity. Copy and paste between mobile/desktop. Apple Pay in desktop Safari. Desktop/Docs in iCloud. Messages ""improvements"" (a shadow of iOS). What's happened to introducing features like Spotlight, or Smart Search, or Folder Actions? Things that actually HELP desktop users? 

* The new features added to macOS this time around are incompetent and unfinished. Nearly everybody agrees. The new PDFKit is driving people crazy, with people saying it was seemingly created by an intern. Some of the GUI design is straight from Windows 98 (the new file management system to free-up space). Many features are undocumented and lead to unexpected outcomes (iCloud Docs/Desktop integration). Siri on Mac is just a single window with limited system integration in terms of carrying out tasks other than searching (ask it some questions and it answers with iPhone answers – say ""Silence"" to it and see what happens). 

* Apple is allegedly having trouble getting the best engineers because its corporate culture is considered toxic. The new campus is so insular and inward looking in spirit and design. Those employees with the best skills and talents want to work on mobile, because that's what's hot. I imagine there's a real trouble getting anybody with real talent to work on macOS, and that's what it really really needs right now. And it shows clearly. 

* No new Macs! It's actually humorous to look at the Macrumors.com ""buy/don't buy"" list. http://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac. 3-4 years since updates! OK, so this is set to change over the coming weeks but Apple's tardiness until this point speaks volumes. 

* Apple's working hard on new ARM chips. Where's the investment in x86? Oh, there isn't any. Yes, x86 has multiple issues but there's an arbitrary cut-off happening here. Apple *could* invest in x86 chip building. They always could've done so, since the first Intel Macs. Was using Intel's chips ultimately a stopgap measure until ARM matured? Are there abandoned blueprints for an Apple x86 chip somewhere in Apple's labs? 

macOS will still have a place, but it'll probably be as a server release largely to prop-up iOS devices (enterprise provisioning), or for high-end video/photo editing, which Apple will support like it always has. It'll be like 2000/NT – capable, but no frills. 

For those of us oldies who still stick to their desktops then we'll have to choose a desktop release to stick with for the future. It may well be Sierra for me. For many it may well be El Capitan. 

EDIT: I realise the title of this implies Apple TV OS is dead. It isn't. That's kind of in the mobile camp.

560329,198,2016-10-05,My boss [40? 50? M] unfairly extended my [23M] internship. I need the job. Can I do anything about it?,izzziezzzie,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/560329/my_boss_40_50_m_unfairly_extended_my_23m/,"A month ago I began working at a company as an intern.  It's a full-time job that not only pays a salary but also covers my graduation school tuition (tuition in addition to salary, not that the salary is enough to cover tuition).  I love my job and it's has given me a lot of great opportunities to advance my career almost immediately.  However, things were rocky from the start.

To begin with, I was supposed to start working while my first semester of school began back in May.  I needed one last interview with my boss to see what level of position I qualified for.  When my boss called me for a phone interview, on a Saturday, I told him I was at a family event and asked if I could call him back another time.  He sounded extremely annoyed and said he would call me back, but never said when.  I emailed him a few times after that to ask for a specific time and he never responded with an actual time for the interview.  He finally did manage to call me for an interview about a month later.  Then he kept telling me he was waiting on paperwork, or that I needed a follow up interview, and this dragged on for another two month.  I didnt begin working until end of the month of August.

By the way, in August my boss made me do a routine errand for the job (optional for employees, they have the right to refuse).  The errand usually invovles driving to a local facility to fix/install something.  I agreed because I wanted to make a good impression, and this was before my boss ever gave me a definite date to start my job so I was really eager.  He didn't say what to do on the phone, he told me to go to the office.  When I got to the office he handed me something and told me tk drive this to another city about 3 hours away.  I wasn't aware that it was going to be such a long drive and that I would pretty much be driving the whole day.  I also drove an unairconditioned car (I would've taken my other car with working air conditioning if I knew).  I spent an entire miserable day running this errand.  My boss told me on the phone that he was going to pay for my time and mileage.

In early August I had a vacation planned.  I was still waiting for my job to start at that point, with no eta from boss.  I called him ahead of time to make sure he doesn't need me for another last-minute bullshit.  Turns out he wants me to go on another errand the exact day I wanted to start my vacation.  I rescheduled my vacation because of it.  He also finally told me over the same phone call that I could start the week after.

First day of work, my boss told me that he was only going to pay for my time actually working on site for that first errand I ran for him.  To put it in perspective, I drove a total of about 6 hours, was on site for about 2 hours.  I was unfer the impression that he was going to pay me mileage for the 6-hour drive.  I told him that's not reasonable and he reluctantly agreed to only pay me for half the drive.

When I first began working, my boss said that according to company policy I have to be an intern for a full month.  If I perform well he could pull me out of internship early.  If I don't he could also terminate my employment at the end of the month.  Shortly after working my boss told me he would let me do a full month of internship because it looks better on my resume (he didn't explain why nd I skeptical of that part).  Either way I signed a contract that said I would be an intern for a month.

Monday was supposed to be the end of my internship. Up to this point I did my job perfectly.  In addition I went above and beyond my job duties.  I often worked weekends and nights on my own time.  I also brought a problem to my boss's attention that ended up saving him a LOT of money.  Overall he has been really impressed. 

On Monday I made a big mistake at work that could've potentially caused us to lose a big client.  Luckily it turned out okay.  But I know I screwed up and I apologized for it.  My boss then used that as an excuse to extend my internship for another two weeks.

I have since found out from a long-time employee at the company that my boss isn't allowed to extend the internship.  In fact, he isn't allowed to have interns to begin with.  My boss's company is a small branch of a much larger company and the employee who informed me of this works for the larger company.  He told me I'm entitled to be paid back for all the work I performed for the past month (as intern I get paid a fraction and enjoy no benefits).

I want to talk to my boss about this but I don't want to lose my job because it covers my tuition.  I'm concerned that he is simply going to let me go.  How should I approach this?
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Worked as an intern for a job that covers my school tuition.  Boss extended the internship over a mistake.  Found out he wasn't supposed to have interns to begin with and that I was entitled to employee status and pay the entire time.  Want to be treated fairly without losing my job. 

  ---
  **Update**: Thank you all for the advice, I was at work and could not respond but I have read through every one of them.  Just to clarify a few things: first and foremost, this job is really important to me and I really want to keep it.  I have no illusions about being treated fairly at this point, but at the end of the day it keeps my tuition paid and it's still decent salary.  When I'm done with school I am going to take my great-looking resume and go find another job asap.  But until then I only plan on losing this job as a very last resort.

Having said that, I still believe I was entitled to full employee status from day 1 based on everything I've been told, but of course I don't want to act irrationally.  So here are the things I've done so far:

- Asked my boss for a letter of recommendation as advised.  Told him I wasn't planning on leaving, just wanted to have one.  He said fine, he would get one to me by the end of the day.  He then said ""you know that means I'll be harder on you right?""  I wasn't sure what he meant, I think it's because I asked him for something so now he gets to be harder on me??  Then I asked him twice over the rest of the day and by the second time I asked him he told me that unless I was planning to quit, I need to relax.  Then he left for work early without giving me the letter.  Not sure what I should do there.

- I  cannot go to HR or go above him.  Not to say that it isn't valuable advice but it simply does not apply to my situation.  Even though my boss's  company belongs to a bigger one, he is pretty independent.  He has no HR.  The office consists of him (CEO), his brother (also executive-level), a receptionist and me.  I think my best bet is to simply talk to him, unless I want to lose this job.

- I am currently looking for the document that shows that he can't have interns.  I have documented my hours over the past month and have calculated the exact amount that he owes me.  I will put everything in a formal e-mail to him and request that he pay me for what is owed and  and then put everything in an e-mail to him (because I want to keep written record of our communication now, as one of you advised).  I am going to leave the discussion open-ended.  I don't care so much about getting paid in full for my past month of work, but I am going to request that he not extend the internship further - that is my bottom line.  But I won't tell him of course.  Who knows, maybe he'll agree to pay me something?  I can only hope.

- I am aware that once the e-mail goes out, I risk losing my job and my tuition.  But I think this is a big enough issue that I have to talk to him and I can't just sit here and let him continue to treat me unfairly, especially if I plan on staying in this position for the next year or two.

- I am also looking for opportunities to transfer to another location and basically work for another company under the same big company.  I don't think this is likely to happen but I will try.  

That's all the update I have for now.  Thank you all again for your help!  I definitely learned a lot, and it was extremely nice to at least know that I'm not alone in feeling like I have been treated unfairly.

  --

  **Edit**: Also, a lot of you were giving me advice on reimbursement for my travels.  I included that as an example of how cheap my boss is, I am not looking for further reimbursements.  Obviously, for future jobs like this, I am going to make sure everything is put in writing.  

But to clarify, the job went like this:  got a call from boss to come into the office in the morning.  Got there, received an item and was told to install it in another city, 3-hours away.

So to explain myself a little, I graduated in 2014 with my Mechanical Engineering degree, but right after I graduated, I decided to enlist in the Army (long story).  Anyway, what I was doing in the Army had nothing to do with ME, and now I'm on my way out looking for ME jobs.  I had two questions:

1. I'm a little rusty on a lot of the material, especially with regards to thermofluids, and strength of materials.  Any advice on reviewing material?  I've been thinking of maybe studying for the FE exam, and through that review a lot of the stuff, but I don't know how good of a review that would be.

2. What do you think of my chances of getting a job?  I graduated with a 3.1 GPA, and I didn't get to do any internship (applied like hell back in college, but didn't get anything, but at least I kept myself busy in school with lots of leadership opportunities).

3. (Sorry, I had 3 questions) How long do you think the hiring process takes, and any tips for getting hired?

Thanks!"
560b7o,7,2016-10-05,Career Decision From Small GC to Large GC,wrx_ing,Construction,https://www.reddit.com/r/Construction/comments/560b7o/career_decision_from_small_gc_to_large_gc/,"I recently applied to work as a field engineer at Kiewit and I have made it through everything and I have my final, in person, interview next week. I did an internship with a small GC, graduated and worked for a mid-sized GC, and then went back to working for the small GC. I have always wanted to work for a large company like Kiewit but the more I look at the reviews the more I question whether I want to do that. A lot of people have said that it is miserable working for large GC's, especially one like Kiewit because the work hours are extremely long (60-80hrs). I have an opportunity to possible work about 40-50 hours making more money with the small GC I am currently working for but I feel that having the Kiewit name on the my resume will help me tremendously in the future. I am currently making about $57k at the small GC as a project manager but my next project would be far from home so I would be getting per-diem most likely which will increase my income significantly since I will most likely sleep in the construction trailer and pocket that money and I will try to work a 4-day work week into my deal. If I work for Kiewit I will probably make somewhere between $65-70k but will be working long hours and possibly weekends. The decision seems straight forward, work less hours and potentially make more money, but it is not. I get no satisfaction working for the small GC because it is mostly rehab work but I also do not want to work 60+ hours minimum. 

Can I get some advice from some older people in here? I am young and graduated just over a year ago and I feel like it would do me some good to hear what people who have worked at large GC's have experienced (especially if you have worked for Kiewit). Any advice helps.

560p9z,103,2016-10-05,My [24F] grandmother [76/F] has dementia and is incredibly angry with me.,DementiaDilemma,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/560p9z/my_24f_grandmother_76f_has_dementia_and_is/,"I'm going to try to explain this as well as possible. 

For my entire childhood, my grandma was a fantastic grandmother. She loved spending time with us grandkids, doing things with us, and just overall great. However, she has always been a difficult person in general. My dad (her son, 50sM) always said that in her mind, she has the only correct worldview, anyone who remotely disagrees is just wrong.

She would cause fights with my mother (her daughter-in-law) over things and just create family drama in general. All the same, we love her, and I have very fond memories of her.

A few years ago, she was diagnosed with dementia. Over the years since, it's gotten much worse. Due to her now current confusion (which I understand is completely out of her control) she has become mean and hateful to the point that even my grandfather (her husband, 70sM), that takes care of her almost 24/7 has to take mini-breaks from her.  

As a kid, I was the perfect grandchild. I was enthusiastic, hardworking, and did everything within my power not to disappoint any of my family. Even as a teenager, I visited them every couple days and in college I visited and called routinely. I am also the only granddaughter and the only grandkid to go to college (my cousins aren't dumb, they just chose different paths, which is awesome for them) and my grandparents did put a lot of pressure on me to be the ""shining star"" of the family (their words). If my GPA was a 3.9 instead of a 4.0 they asked ""What brought you down?"" 

My grandma always said she didn't have a favorite grandchild, but pretty much everyone in the family acknowledges that even if I wasn't a favorite, I was ""special"". I'm not praising this or ""bragging"", nor did I want to be more ""special"" than my cousins. This is just for context.

However, last year, I got really busy. School was way more intense, I had an internship that took up almost all my after school time and weekends. I didn't have any time to visit or call that much because I was busy from 8am-11pm most days and I don't have a car (don't need one where I live) so I relied on my other family to drive if we scheduled something. 

I did call when I could though. However, because I did all this less than I have in the past, my grandmother got angry with me. She put down all my pictures, told everyone how selfish I was, and all manner of things. My parents and my grandfather, and myself, tried to kindly explain everything to her, but because of her condition, she didn't understand. 

I missed the Christmas family gathering because my family scheduled it on a day I had to do my internship, and it couldn't be changed. I visited my grandpa later on in December and he said we weren't seeing grandma because she was having a bad day. I was there for Thanksgiving last year and my grandmother refused to say a word to me though she socialized with everyone else. I talked to her, but she ignored me and that hurt. Pretty much any time I see her since has been like that. 

I've only gotten busier with work and school, and as a result I have been more unable to visit my hometown. Because of having to organize rides, a lot of times planning stuff doesn't work out. If I had a car, I would absolutely be there as much as I could, and I try to call but she doesn't want to talk to me.

It gets more complicated because she remembers things incorrectly. She claims I haven't been there for holidays (I have), that I never call (I do), that I never give her birthday/Christmas gifts (I do) and stuff. If someone corrects her, she gets angry and asserts that she knows she's correct. 

My other cousins never go to see her unless it's a holiday, but she doesn't hate them for it. Even my dad moved across the country and almost never calls and she's not mad at him. It seems all her anger is directed at me. 

I've given up on trying to reason with her (that sounds mean, but she cannot really understand reason anymore). I'm not angry at her as I know this isn't her fault in the least. I've accepted that she isn't the same person anymore. I want to spend as much time with her as I can before her condition worsens or she passes away, but she's so angry at me and I don't even know if my efforts will help, with her being confused and not remembering things. 

I feel tremendous guilt over this, like I've done something horrible. Maybe I didn't try hard enough before. I'm already doing all I can to schedule more visits and I'm calling regularly, but it doesn't seem to be helping right now.

How can I try to repair my relationship with my grandmother on some level? Maybe I didn't try hard enough? How do I make this right? 

  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My grandmother has dementia and doesn't remember me visiting or calling, even though I do. She is now incredibly angry with me but I don't know how to make it right. "

560qb1,2,2016-10-05,My [22F] girlfriend of 8 months has all but completely shut me [22M] out of her life. Her Dad passed away in June and I don't know how much longer I can be supportive...,ThePopesicle,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/560qb1/my_22f_girlfriend_of_8_months_has_all_but/,"
Hey guys. I don't post much on Reddit in general but I can see that this is a safe and great place. I've had trouble sharing this with my closer friends since we share the same circle and it seems like a lot of advice that I get is biased in some form. 

Our relationship has been a little rocky from the start, but through most of it I've remained head over heals for her because I really do love this girl. She confessed her feelings to me after a year and a half of friendship, which was perfect for me because I had just given up on trying to impress other girls and decided to wait until the right one came along. This was great; we shared almost everything in common and really enjoyed one another's company. There were just a few issues. 1.) She didn't share the same faith/religion as me (which I really don't think should be a deciding factor in a relationship.) 2.) She had a bad habit of cutting me off in conversation and telling me to “shut up,” but I was willing to put up with it and work on it for now. 3.) She was leaving for an internship in Florida (3000 miles away) in just a month. 

So we talked about doing long distance and it seemed that we were both determined to make it work. We talked on the phone at least twice a day, constantly texted each other etc. She struggled over there at first making connections and friends but after about 2 months she really started to hang around some great people. I even got to fly over there to see her and meet them. The GF and I booked a hotel together and made a vacation of it. I had to fly back before school started but it was nice knowing that it would only be a month until her internship was over and we could be back together. She hadn’t even met most of my family and greater friend group yet.

It was only 5 days later she got the call about her Dad and she was flying back home.

Her relationship with her Dad was historically pretty great, but recently they had distanced themselves from one another. He had been struggling with alcoholism for a long time, and ultimately a rough batch of pneumonia caught up with his weakened immune system. He was only 50. She was destroyed at first, taking the first flight home and leaving everything in Florida. But within the first few days, she had appeared to grow numb to it. She has told me before that she will always be strong for others before she cares for herself. I constantly tried to be there for her. Sometimes she was open about how she was feeling, but most of the time she just wanted to be alone. She quickly grew short tempered, and appeared annoyed at my very existence. I could tell I was being closed off.

She really still blames herself for not being at home when he passed, despite the fact that her internship was an opportunity of a lifetime. We went through the funeral service, saw all the distant relatives and took in all of the well wishes. Eventually she started working again, picking up a part time job at a coffee stand. With school starting up again soon, I advised her to take less hours, but she took more instead, and eventually got a second part time job. With her working 35-40 hours a week and taking a full course load she’s all but disappeared from the face of the earth. I haven't seen my girlfriend for more than 45 minutes in the last 25 days. I call, I text, I show up at her house and knock on the door. Nothing. She's immensely depressed, I know. When she's not working or studying, she's sleeping. She's constantly sick. When she does talk to me it’s very short. I keep trying to get her to open up to me and she did say that she would talk to me eventually, but that was 10 days ago. 

This is the current situation. Still rarely talk, and when we do, there’s typically something to be angry with me about. She said she is starting medication and professional help, but given her recent tendencies I think it’ll be a while until any appointments are scheduled. I feel useless. In one of the few conversations we had recently, she literally told me that there is absolutely nothing I can do. In response I asked, “then what good am I? Why are we dating?” Nothing.

I still love her, but the feelings I once had a very much gone. I know what verbal abuse is like and she dishes out plenty, but I’ve been taking every punch with the belief that it’s not coming from the real her. Things are really starting to take a toll on my own mental well-being. I had a panic attack on stage at church last Sunday. My depression and anxiety, which I’ve been fighting off my whole life, are back in full force and I don’t know if I can win with this much baggage. I so desperately want to be strong for her, but she thinks I’m useless. No sign of a break up on her side anytime soon.  

Where do I go from here? What can I do (as a boyfriend or just as a friend) to help both her and I? I’m not necessarily looking for answers, just any sort of input to help me with my situation. 

TL;DR my GFs Dad died 3 months ago. The reality has caught up with her and we have hardly talked in the last month. She refuses to let me help. When we do talk, she makes it clear how useless I am and how no one can help her. No idea what to do.

Edit: we finally talked. It sounds like she was very much aware of the toll it was taking on both of us. We ended it, but set clear parameters on how we're going to maintain our friendship "

“We lost another receptionist. You know the one down on 3? Yeah she didn’t show for work today” Ralph Marks told the human resources woman. “No, no don’t worry about it. I’ll call for a temp while I interview for a permanent replacement. Good help is so hard to find these days.”
	
Ralph began clicking the necessary buttons on his computer screen that would post the online job posting for the now vacant position. This receptionist had lasted just four months but that was practically a record for Alcore Industrial Kitchen Supplies. The turnover at the company was remarkably high and as the president of sales and staffing it was Ralph’s responsibility to hire. He looked over his calendar for the coming month, thinking he could probably squeeze a few interviews in throughout the next week. He hit the intercom to allow him to speak to his own receptionist, “Mary, please free Friday afternoon for interviews. We lost another receptionist.”

	“Will do Mr. Marks,” Mary replied. 
	
Leaning back in his chair Ralph sighed, if only all the women he hired could be more like Mary. Always present, on time, cheerful and competent. She had been his secretary for long as he had held his position and he hadn’t had a problem yet. He knew he was very lucky to have her.  It can’t be easy coming into work every day not knowing who will be sitting out there answering your phones, typing your correspondence, bringing your coffee. First world problems as they say, but it really can make all the difference. 

	Of course it didn’t hurt that Mary was attractive. Blonde curls, blue eyes, curvy, stereotypical hot receptionist; but Ralph had always made it a point to keep things completely professional, as had Mary. 
	
His wife Lisa had never approved of Mary, had always been jealous. She constantly compared her mousy brown hair and flat chested figure to the other woman’s bouncy locks and hourglass shape. His marriage had really never been the same since he got the promotion to president that afforded him his own secretary. Though he explained again and again that he was confident in his choice of marrying her and that there was absolutely nothing going on between him and Mary, she never quite believed him. She didn’t believe him when he said that he was working late, even if he called her from his office phone. She always imagined the worst. 
	
They had never been able to have kids, and while Ralph was secretly happy about that fact it left Lisa with a lot of free time. She didn’t have a career or hobbies or even many friends so she spent nearly all of her time worrying about him. 

	There had been a brief period where things had actually seemed to be looking up. Lisa had started volunteering at the local women’s shelter. She really took an interest in the cause and had taken a special liking to some of the women. She took them on lunch dates, shopping, that sort of thing. Ralph wasn’t thrilled with her spending so much of his hard earned money on these women and this caused a minor tension between them but in the end he backed off, letting her have her fun as long as it kept her occupied. 
	
Lisa’s favorite was a 20 year old girl named Jessica. She had two young children and an abusive ex boyfriend. She was small and mousy just like Lisa. Ralph guessed they bonded over that and of course Lisa was crazy about the kids. There were two boys, age two and four. Even Ralph had to admit they were cute little things, all big eyes and curls but they were also loud and sticky and rambunctious. Definitely not his cup of tea and he didn’t like having them around the house too much. He was also suspicious of their mother. He thought she might steal from them. Lisa was well aware of his feelings and did her best to keep the visits to the house to daytime hours when Ralph would be at work. 
	
For almost a full year things were going well. Lisa was fulfilled and Ralph was just happy to be able to come and go as he pleased without her constant nagging. The couple had never been that passionately in love but it seemed as if they were back in the early days of their marriage. They were actually happy to see each other after a long day apart. They even went on a few dates. Overall things were great, until the day that Ralph came home to find his favorite watch missing. It was a very expensive item and he was sure he had left it on the mantle, but when he returned home from work that day it was gone. In his mind there was really only one explanation. 
	
At first Lisa denied that Jessica could possibly have had anything to do with it. “She would never do that to me,” she said. Soon enough though as days came and went with no sign of the watch she had to concede that maybe she did take it. As far as Ralph could tell there was a big blow up when Lisa confronted Jessica about taking the watch. She vehemently insisted she was innocent and was so taken aback that Lisa would make such an accusation that she said she hoped to never see her again. 
	
This hurt Lisa very much but she continued her volunteer work.  She didn’t seem to get attached to the women anymore though. She just did what she needed to and left her heart out of it. Eventually Jessica called and apologized to Lisa for the things she had said, though she still didn’t admit that she took the watch Lisa was ecstatic that the relationship could be repaired.  Ralph had made it clear that they were not to return to his home so Lisa had immediately made plans to visit the three of them at Jessica’s new apartment. 

	As Ralph was just finishing up some paperwork for a big account he had landed his phone rang. Since it hadn’t gone through the secretary’s desk he knew it had to be someone with the direct number, unfortunately only one person used that line to call him. He let the phone ring through to voicemail. He was in a great mood from his big sale and refused to be brought down by Lisa’s nonsense today. To his great annoyance the phone trilled again just seconds later. He snatched the phone up, “What?” 

	“Oh Ralph! I can’t believe this, I just can’t” she wailed into his ear. 
	
“What is it?” Ralph asked, alarmed rather than annoyed now. 

	“They’re all……dead. All of them. How could this happen?”

	“Ok, now I need you to slow down and explain what’s going on. I can’t possibly help you if I don’t know what the problem is. Who is dead? Oh no, it’s not your parents is it?”
	
“No Ralph not my parents, Jessica and the boys. I went to their apartment for our visit and…..just please get home. I can’t be alone right now” she cried.
	
Ralph sighed. He really wasn’t in the mood to deal with this at all. “Ok, I’ll be home just as soon as I possibly can. You just rest for now. I’ll be there soon.”
	
He wrapped up what he was currently working on and called Mary to let her know he would be leaving shortly and that she could have the rest of the day off as well. Mary was gone by the time he walked out into the outer office, he turned off the lights and locked up. Resisting the urge to check things in the showroom, he headed home. 
	
Lisa was sleeping on the couch when he got home. Her face was red and puffy from crying. Ralph tried to be quiet in order to not wake her but her eyes snapped open as soon as he walked in to the room. At first she looked confused then her face crumpled in on itself as she remembered what was happening. 

	“Oh Ralph it was horrible,” she cried. 
	
It turned out that Lisa had been the one to find the bodies. She was stopping by for a visit. After knocking several times, she tried the front door and found it unlocked. Inside she found Jessica’s body lying in a pool of blood in the kitchen. She was beaten black and blue and barely recognizable. The boys were still in the bed they shared with their mother. They could almost have been sleeping, she said, if not for the gaping wounds in each of their heads and the congealed blood drying on the pillows. 

	“At least the boys didn’t suffer honey,” Ralph said comfortingly, “they probably didn’t even know what hit them.”
	
Lisa burst into tears again. “I know who hit them” she cried. “That crazy ex- boyfriend of hers. He must have tracked them down and killed them when she wouldn’t take him back. She always said he’d be the death of her.” 
	
The next few months passed with Lisa in an increasingly depressed state. She became desperately needy and while Ralph tried to be patient and supportive his patience quickly grew thin. He paid for the best psychologist around who diagnosed Lisa with severe depression and PTSD. She was on a laundry list of medications but nothing could seem to pull her out of the dark place she was in. There was a brief period where she seemed to be coming around, until she found the watch that she had accused Jessica of stealing under the couch and broke down all over again. She called Ralph at the office crying and almost incoherent. At this point he had had enough, he was missing work left and right over her silliness. He had even lost a big client because he wasn’t able to make an important business dinner.

“Lisa, this is getting to be unacceptable. You need to grow up and move on. Those people were not your family and were nothing but a burden on society. I know you loved them but they are gone and will never come back, your moping and crying and calling me at work will not help them.  If you want to be miserable go right ahead, but leave me out of it.”
	
There was silence on the phone for a long moment and then Lisa whispered “Ok” and hung up. Ralph felt he may have taken it a step too far, but what else could he do? He didn’t see any other way to handle the situation that wouldn’t have been equally hurtful. So he put the situation out of his mind and focused on his work. 

There were no more phone calls from Lisa that day. No more calls for the next three days in fact. Ralph felt that he had done exactly the right thing, Lisa had been more herself lately. Very quiet, but he quite enjoyed that. Ralph took advantage of that by working later and later each day. 
One night he came in around 10 o’clock at night and found Lisa waiting for him at the kitchen table. He was even later than usual and opened his mouth to give some sort of explanation or apology, but the look on her face stopped him. Her calm demeanor from the last few days was nowhere to be found. Her face was twisted into a sneer that he would have sworn she was incapable of. Her generally sweet and amiable attitude was what has attracted him to her and the thing he still counted on from her. The way that she was looking at him now, he barely recognized her as his wife. 
Ralph decided to ignore the strange way Lisa was behaving. 

“Hey, sorry I’m a little late. It was a crazy day. How are you?”

Lisa snorted mirthlessly, “Oh I’m just great. It’s always so nice to sit at home alone waiting for my cheating husband to get done fucking his secretary and come home.”

Ralph was dumbfounded by the outburst. He shook his head and sighed rubbing his eyes.

“Lisa, I thought we were past this. I know you’ve been having a rough time lately but let’s not over react.”

“What would you have me think then?” she demanded. “Should I believe that my husband is working late into the night selling kitchen appliances?” She laughed again but there were tears leaking from her eyes.  

Ralph started toward her, meaning to touch her arm. “Lisa, please..” but she cut him off. 

“No. I’m done looking  the other way. I’ve been your quiet little mouse for too many years.”

“What’s brought this on?” Ralph asked. “I don’t understand.”
Lisa was quiet for a moment then she sighed loudly and seemed to deflate. It was as if she had pumped herself up just enough for that exchange and anymore would completely exhaust her. 

“Maybe” she begins, in a shaky voice, “maybe I’m just finally letting myself say what I’ve always know.”
With that she turned away from him and headed down the long hallway to the bedroom they shared. When she reached the doorway she hesitated for a second before turning around. 

“Fire her or I want a divorce” she said, then turned back around and walked back into the bedroom, closing the door behind her. 

Ralph sat down heavily at the kitchen table. This was an unfortunate turn of events, he thought. He knew he couldn’t fire Mary, she had been with him for far too long and he knew that good help like her was hard to come by. On the other hand, he couldn’t lose Lisa. He wasn’t actually opposed to being a bachelor, in fact it sounded like exactly the lifestyle he would enjoy, but having a wife completed his trustworthy good guy image. As a salesman half the battle is convincing the client to trust you, no one trusts an adulterer. 
He took care of a few things and then lay down on the couch. He thought everything would probably work out for the best in the end, nothing he could do about it now anyhow he told himself. 

	Everything was quiet the next day when Ralph awoke. There was no sign of Lisa. He ate a quick breakfast and rushed out the door. He was running late, the excitement the night before had worn him out more than he would have expected. He stopped briefly to grab a duffel bag full of some things to store at work and was soon speeding down the highway. 
	
After he had parked his car, right up front in the spot with his name stenciled on it, he looked at the duffel in the backseat. He decided he’d deal with it later before he went home. It was nothing that couldn’t wait after all. He was in an especially good mood that morning as he pushed the large glass double doors and made his way into the lobby. He greeted the security guard at the desk and made his way to the elevator that would take him to his office. 

	“Good morning Mr. Marks” Mary said when he walked into the outer office. She was smiling her customary bright smile. Ralph returned the greeting with a smile of his own and went into his office, closing the door behind him. He made a mental note to check into a raise for Mary. 
	
Ralph spent the morning making calls to clients, following up on new orders and attempting to persuade the new pizza place downtown that they would really benefit from the newest oven model they had just gotten in. He invited the owner to come on down and take a look at it. It had been Ralph’s idea to convert the mostly unused basement into a showroom of sorts for the products. A show model of each of the high end products they sold was housed down there; most were fully functional so that potential customers could try them out before committing. Things were looking promising for a sale when he hung up. He slogged through several interviews for the open position that he knew were dead ends. After he had walked the last candidate out and thanked them for their time, assuring that he would call them just as soon as something opened up, he sighed. 
	
“No winners, huh?” Mary asked.
	
He smiled sheepishly, “Guess not.”
	
“Don’t worry, you’ll find the right one, you always do.”
	
“Well,” Ralph replied as he walked into his office, “they can’t all be as good as you, now can they?’ Mary smiled at the comment and went back to the letter she was typing and Ralph went into the office and closed the door. He just couldn’t understand how Lisa could really think anything was going on between the two of them. They were always professional with each other. 
	
The rest of the day passed quickly and before he knew it Mary was popping her head in to let him know that she was leaving for the night. 

	“Six already?” he asked. 

	“Afraid so,” she replied. “It seems like you practically live here though. I bet you’re not even close to leaving are you?” 
	
Ralph chuckled, “I’m actually just wrapping up. But you are right, I can’t help it. I just enjoy my work.”

	“I can tell. I definitely admire your work ethic. Have a good night Mr. Marks.” 
	
After Mary closed the door behind her Ralph’s smile seemed to evaporate. Her comment worried him. Had anyone else noticed his long hours?

	He decided that it would be a good idea to go ahead and head home. He had pulled on his coat and was locking up the office door when he remembered the bag in his car. He didn’t really feel like dealing with it at the moment but he had never been one to put things off so he decided he’d better go ahead and get that taken care of. He was anxious to check on things in the showroom anyway. 
	
He nodded to the security guard as he pushed the doors open. 
	“Sir…excuse me. Will you need back in tonight?” the young guard asked him. “I’d like to go ahead and lock up but I wouldn’t want to inconvenience you.”

	“Oh, I just have a few things to put down in the showroom. You go right ahead and lock up. I’ll go in the back door” he told him with a smile. 

	He heard the lock click behind him as he made his way to his car. The day was unseasonably warm and the car belched out hot, musty air when he opened the door. Ralph grimaced at the smell but slid behind the wheel and pulled his car around the building to the rear entrance. He debated on parking in the no parking zone for only a moment before throwing the car in park right alongside the back door and getting out. He decided that he would risk the ticket. He didn’t plan to be inside long anyway and the bag was pretty heavy.
He made sure to prop the door open before wrestling the bag out of the backseat. Sweat was dripping from his brow by the time he made it down the long hallway and into the showroom. He sat the bag down for a moment in the doorway to catch his breath. The room was enormous. Along one wall were large industrial sized ovens and grills, another displayed dishwashers and countertops. There were various specialty items along another wall, meat grinders and giant mixers. Ralph often felt like he imagined Jack must have felt stepping into the Giant’s kitchen. What Ralph wanted was against the back wall where the walk in freezers were lined up neatly side by side. A large padlock hung from the latch of each of them. This was another of Ralph’s ideas. They couldn’t, after all have the stupid interns playing around in these things and possibly getting locked in. It would really be a lawsuit waiting to happen. 
	
With a grunt Ralph hefted the duffel and headed for the freezer in the very corner of the room. It was an older model than the rest and there was slim to no interest in viewing it, but still Ralph kept it around while the rest of the inventory was rotated every few months or so. When he finally reached the freezer he dropped the bag with a thud and started fishing for the key to the padlock. He finally found the key and opened the big door. He took a deep breath and lifted the duffel bag over the threshold and followed it with a sigh. 
	
The first thing he did was pull the door shut behind him, being careful to wedge a thin piece of cardboard into the opening so he couldn’t be locked in himself. Then he turned on the overhead light and went to work unpacking the bag. With that done he sat down for a moment to rest. He felt a lot better having taken care of that task and was actually pretty tired all of a sudden. He leaned back against the icy wall and watched his breath make frost in the air. He always felt more at ease here.
	
Within several minutes he was snoring lightly, chin touching his chest. His eyes snapped open when he heard footsteps in the showroom. He got to his feet with effort, his joints stiff from the cold and hurried to the door. 
	
“Mr. Marks? Are you down here?” Mary called. 
	
Thoughts bounced wildly in his head. Should he remain silent and hope that she went away? Or should he come out and hope that she wouldn’t question why he was there in the first place. His mind finally settled on a solution and he opened the door just enough so that she could see him. 

	“I’m in here Mary, what brings you back to the office? I thought you’d gone home already?”
	
“I did start to head home but left my purse in the office. Along with my keys, so that I couldn’t get back in when I realized what happened. I had a feeling you might still be here though. Thank goodness” Mary laughed at herself a little, “you must think I’m such a blonde.”
	
“No of course not” Ralph said with a smile. “We all make mistakes sometimes. I’ll be glad to let you into the office, but hey would you mind giving me a hand over here for just a minute?”
	
Mary hesitated for the slightest moment and then walked toward the freezer door. 
	
“So, what’s going on? Something wrong with the unit?”
	
Ralph didn’t say anything until Mary was within arm’s reach. He stepped back and opened the door wider. Mary’s smile faded and was replaced by a blank, confused stare when she what the freezer held. She tried to back away instinctively but Ralph grabbed her arm while simultaneously clamping a hand over her mouth and pulled her into the freezer with him. He held her against his body and said quietly, “Can you promise not to scream? If you can promise me that, I can let you go. We can sit down and have a talk.” 
	
She quickly nodded her head and tried to say something under his hand. He removed his hand from her mouth but kept it up, ready to replace it at a moment’s notice. She remained quiet though she was breathing heavily and making whimpering sounds. She looked around in horror at Ralph’s prized collection. 
	
Eight women were placed around the interior of the freezer. Seven of them were seated along the walls. They were all made to look like they had just sat down for a rest after a long day at work, still dressed in the business suits and dresses that they had last worn. They were all blonde and bore a disturbing resemblance to Mary herself. The thick layer of ice on all but one of the women ruined whatever illusion Ralph had been trying for. The last woman was a brunette. She was dressed in a sweat suit and sat away from the rest of the women.
	
Finally, Mary whispered, “why Ralph? Why would you do this?”
	
“You don’t like my collection?” he asked, he sounded truly surprised. “Do you recognize any of them?” 
	
Mary looked closer at the women and gasped, recognizing several past coworkers. 

	“How Ralph? How could you possibly do this?”
	
“Ahh, I’m glad you asked,” Ralph exclaimed, he had been terrified of anyone finding out his little secret but now that it had happened he found himself excited to show them off. He held out his hand and pointed to a woman in the corner, she had clearly been there the longest. The thick layer of ice almost obscured her face. 
	
“Courtney here was my first. She was working late and I happened to bump into her headed out the door. She didn’t want to accept a ride from me, but it was raining so she did. I didn’t really plan to kill her when I offered to take her home. But it was almost like someone took over my body, once it was done I knew I couldn’t just throw her away, so I brought her here. Then I realized that I could keep her and see her anytime I liked. It wasn’t long before I thought she needed a little company.”
	
At this point he had eased away from Mary, engrossed in his own story he was moving closer to the bodies and farther from the door. Mary’s eyes darted from him to the door quickly. 
	
“So, you killed eight women just so that you could keep them here to look at? You know that makes you a serial killer right?” 
	
“No, no, no Mary!” he exclaimed. “I killed seven of them to look at, the last one was an unfortunate necessity.” With that he chuckled, “You know my wife always thought that we were having an affair? She actually gave me an ultimatum last night, fire you or get a divorce. I didn’t like either of those options so I made my own choice.”
	
“You killed your wife?” Mary questioned, she was determined to keep him talking until she was able to get to the door. 

“How could you do that? Didn’t you love her?”
	
“Of course I loved her, she was my wife. But what option did she leave me?” He frowned and turned to stare at Mary. “Everything was fine before that girl and her little brats came into my life. If only they had stayed away I wouldn’t have had to kill them and she wouldn’t have gone crazy. How was I to know the watch had fallen into the chair in my study?”
	
Mary is confused by this latest outburst, but she nods, “of course. You did what you had to.”
	
Ralph nodded and continued speaking, droning on about each of the women in his collection. Mary knew this was her last chance to make it out of this situation alive. She took a deep breath and made a break for the door. She pushed it open and got one foot out before Ralph grabbed her and pulled her back inside. She screamed for help but the door was already shut and there was no one close enough to hear anyway. 
	
“I thought you were going to be quiet?” Ralph asked. “Why would you do that?” He seemed genuinely upset, “I thought I could trust you? Do you know how hard it is to find a good receptionist?”
	
Mary was crying profusely. “I won’t say anything. I swear. No one will ever know about this.”
	
Ralph thought for a moment, Mary could almost see the gears turning in his head. 
	
“You also said you wouldn’t scream” he said and started toward her. 
	
The next morning Ralph got to the office later than usual. The outer office was dark and empty, no one had put on the coffee and the phone was ringing ceaselessly. He sighed and unlocked the door to his office. He sat down at his desk and picked up the phone. 

	“Yes, this is Ralph Marks, I’m going to need a temporary secretary. Yes as soon as possible please. My secretary hasn’t shown for work today. Good help is so hard to find these days."

I am a recent college graduate, I've been working an internship since mid-July and am keenly interested in looking for work/educational opportunities in applied data &amp; statistical analysis. My degree was in Public Policy Analysis with a certificate in Energy &amp; the Environment. My last year and a half in school I began to become more interested in stats and data after taking the Introductory Stats course. I then decided to take another course dedicated to Regression Analysis techniques, a Statistical Probability course, and a course on Applied Big Data in Energy &amp; Science. I certainly would have continued to pursue courses in this area had I more time as an undergraduate, and now want to develop these skills and knowledge further. In terms of areas I would like to apply these skills, I obviously have a lot of interest in policy and energy, and how data intersects these fields. I am currently located in D.C. and am searching for opportunities here given my experience and background as it stands now.

For those out there with more experience and working in the capacity I envision for myself, what advice would you have for me right now? I'm looking to work for two years at the moment before considering full time graduate education; however, I am certainly open and more than willing to engage in educational opportunities that are available and doable while working. What kind of jobs should I focus on looking for? (thus far trying to find entry-level data analyst positions or positions where I can work with data to some degree). What kinds of potential graduate programs would you recommend? (Applied statistics, business analytics, etc.)

I consider myself as having a motivated and strong work-ethic. If I can find a job that allows me enough time outside of work, I would want to spend that time setting goals and self-learning with available resources. I only took Calculus I &amp; II in school (performed so-so, unfortunately wasn't as motivated or had direction as a freshman), did pretty well in Probability, and have basic-to-intermediate experience in R (what we used for all of my stats courses). I know that I will likely need Linear Algebra and Calc III, what's the best way to go about learning those? (local community colleges, online courses, etc.)

I'm not the strongest quantitative person I know, but I definitely have an interest in data and want to be working with it no matter where I am, and am willing to put in the effort to get there.

Thanks for any advice or help!

tl;dr Want to get more into data analysis, have some experience, need advice on continuing to grow."
560z58,8,2016-10-05,Sent a followup email to my Rep,hardycore4,kratom,https://www.reddit.com/r/kratom/comments/560z58/sent_a_followup_email_to_my_rep/,"Despite the substantial support we have received for our cause, I was not happy by the lack of response from my representative, Nydia Velazquez. Here's a copy of the letter I emailed to her:

Hello Nydia Velazquez. I have contacted you a number of times in the past regarding the DEA's intent to schedule the active alkaloids in kratom. The fight being made by myself and fellow kratom users has been very successful thus far. The Pocan/Salmon Dear Colleague Letter which I urged you to sign on to has had the support of over 50 representatives, and a similar letter penned by Orrin Hatch has had the support of 9 Senators. Additionally, our Senator Kirsten Gilibrand has issued her own letter of the same type to the DEA. Currently, the DEA has yet to schedule kratom, but there is no guarantee that they will make the ethical choice.

As your constituent, I was very disappointed when I never heard any response from you when I urged you to sign the Pocan/Salmon letter. On one afternoon when I had called your office, an intern had mentioned that I was the only constituent that had been contacting you regarding this issue. This makes sense considering the relatively small area you are representing. However, it should be clear now more than ever that this is an extremely important national issue that must be taken seriously. In New York State alone, 2,175 opioid related deaths were reported in 2013. Countless anecdotal reports from citizens have supported kratom's usefulness as an aid for pain and addiction, and researchers have been dismayed that the DEA's scheduling could harm their work in learning about kratom's benefits:

http://www.forbes.com/sites/davidkroll/2016/09/28/top-kratom-researcher-discusses-potential-medical-use-in-opioid-withdrawal/#4494ffcd265b

It is fair to say that, considering how ubiquitous opioid use is throughout the nation, there are many in your district who suffer from addiction who deserve the opportunity to access an alternative such as kratom.

I would love to consider you as a Congresswoman representing my values in an extremely important personal and national issue. However, until I get an indication of support from you, or any response at all, I will not support your reelection this November, and I will be vocal about it.

I just had a really bad week with video, where stories that have no business being video stories are still assigned to me and I have to produce videos...so I end up having to act like a television cameraman, getting interviewee talking heads and shooting staged footage for b-roll...for example many times we cover profile stories and I get sent down to make a video of say, a runner, and I have to get him to run around solely for the sake of getting shots for my video sequences, or have a scientist 'act natural' as he walks around his lab fake-looking at stuff.

Then I spend hours editing the footage into something I won't even care for watching myself. The videos end up looking like a freshman school assignment or corporate PR fluff at best. This was not what I signed up for but my editors don't care as long as we get video to put on Facebook, and the views keep coming in.

On the rare occasion I get to cover a worthwhile story, shooting video is more bearable but I hate that I'm compromising on my still pictures by having to do both at the same time. 

I really wanted to give video a chance, and I've seen some really great video work done by photographers turned videographers/filmmakers, but I'm starting to think it's just really not me. 

Anyway, does anyone have transitioning to video stories to share? Would like to hear more from anyone in similar situations.

I have been seriously considering going to culinary school, but with a lot of reading I have learned that it may be a more responsible option to simply intern and learn on the job instead of pay ~$40,000 for school.

I am interested in becoming a pastry chef. I have quite a bit of home training, but am interested in elevating my techniques and learning how to make ""fancier"" desserts as well as chocolates and other confections.

I was wondering if I may get some opinions from professionals on what is the best option. If interning is the best option, how would I go about approaching bakeries and restaurants for jobs without any relevant experience? I am in the Los Angeles area.

Permission Slips and Explosions
---

The incident at the church besides, my family and I was settling down in the new neighborhood pretty well. Despite Janice’s warning, I hadn’t seen the Junker. I hadn’t heard anybody talking about it anymore since that first day either. It seems everyone had moved onto another topic. Fred occasionally found me in the hallways in between classes. He stayed true to character, chatting my ear off about whatever came to mind at the moment. At least he wasn’t talking about the Uncannies anymore.

   “So, you’re going to come, right?”

   “What?” 

   I wasn’t paying attention. I already made a habit of tuning out whatever Fred was saying, like white noise on a radio.

   “You *are* coming to the meeting after school, right?” Fred repeated.

   “What meeting?”

   Fred rolled his eyes. “The meeting for the Uncanny Investigation Club. Duh!”

   “I’m not going.”

   “What? Why not? It’ll be cool!”

   “There’s no such thing as Uncannies. I don’t buy it.”

   “And that’s *totally* cool. There’s no rule against not believing the Uncannies exist, although that’s kind of the point of the club… All you really have to do is hang out… It’ll be fun!” Fred added when he saw my overall lack of enthusiasm.

   “For the last time Fred, I’m not joining your stupid club!”

 *It was late spring, just turning into the beginnings of lazy summer days. The intense pacing of all those winter projects had slowed to the languid stretch of the last few months before summer vacation. Yet there was still excitement in the classroom during this past week, with today climaxing to a feverish pitch. The teacher had a heck of a time trying to calm everyone down enough to begin class, although she looked just as excited as her students, and for a good reason. There was a not-so-hushed whisper that had infected the class and its name was “School Camp”.*

  *School Camp is when the classes of the oldest grade in the school would go out to the summer camp in the forest outside of town. Students would go there by school bus, leaving early Monday morning and coming back late Wednesday afternoon. They’d be staying in cabins, just like they would at Summer Camp. In fact, there wasn’t any difference between School Camp and Summer Camp, except that the former happened during what would ordinarily be school time. What student didn’t enjoy an excuse to avoid school and do something fun instead?*

  *“Alright class, settle down!” The teacher had to be louder than the standard ""inside voice"" to be heard over the din. “As you all know, today is the last day to hand in permission slips for camp. *But,*” she added even as bags shuffled and papers shifted to pull out sheet upon sheet of precious forms. “Before you do, we have a guest today from an ecological research group that has been working near where you’ll be staying. Please make them feel welcome.”*

  *The class applauded as the intern who’d been waiting patiently outside the door finally came in. The intern looked simultaneously intimidated and pleased at the sudden attention and puffed her chest out before she began.*

   *“H-hello there boys and girls.” She cringed at how she sounded. What was she? A show host on one of those corny kid’s shows?*

   *“Uh… Uhhhh…” Shoot. She was drawing a blank.*

   *She always froze up in front of crowds, never mind that these were a bunch of kids. The professor she's working under really should have come here instead, but he was still recovering from the accident at the lab.*

   *“Ahem. Wildlife,” the teacher prompted, much like she would for any of her students if they’d forgotten their lines during a play.*

   *“Oh, right! So, you guys are going on a camping trip right?”*

   *There was more or less unanimous nodding of heads.*

   *“Okay, that’s what I thought. Uh, well, you see… There’s been some concerning animal activity in surrounding areas, especially around the campsite where you guys will be staying at. Some of the wildlife has, uh, become unpredictable and may be dangerous if approached.”*

  *A concerned murmur floated from seat to seat, although briefly, before being firmly grounded again by a hush from the teacher.*

 *“Uh… Like I was saying… The affected animals are dangerous, so d-don’t go near them, okay? We’ve already notified the camp you guys are going to, so you might not go hiking, but I-I’m sure you’ll have fun anyways.”*

   *“Thank you for telling us, Doctor…?”*

   *“Oh, uh, I’m still just a student. The Doc was supposed to come b-but… stuff happened.”*

   *“I see… Actually, I was asking for your name Miss ‘Student’.”*

   *“O-Oh.” Miss “Student” turned Miss “Scarlet”. “M-my name is Jean Rose.”*

   *“Well Miss Rose, would you be willing to accept some questions?”*

   *“Um, I won’t be able to answer everything you have to ask, but I’ll do my best.”*

   *And so the Q and A began. Most questions were centered on what Jean did, what to do if they came across a dangerous animal, and what a dangerous animal looked and acted like. The last question, however, was a completely different sort of beast.*

   *“Is the explosion from a few weeks ago making the animals act funny?”*

   *The class went dead silent. No more excited whispering; they were all ears. Everyone knew and remembered about the explosion that happened in the woods; the kids all heard it loud and clear from the school. The newspaper said that it was an errant explosion of swamp gas, a rare phenomenon on such a powerful scale, but nothing more than that.*

   *“Uh…” Jean couldn’t speak.*

   *Poor Jean shrank under all those intense stares. You could see on her face an expression that was eerily similar to the expression of a mouse that's cornered by a particularly hungry feline; panic.*

   *“Uhhhh…”*

   *What could she say to these kids?* 

   *“Uhhhhhhhhhhhh…”*

   *This is not what she signed up for when she decided to intern.*

   *“…Maybe…?” She squeaked.*

   *Nobody looked impressed by her performance, least of all Jean herself. She made a clumsy show of checking the time and muttered something about being late and needing to ""get back"" before leaving.*

   *With the guest visit over and done with, the teacher started to collect permission slips, just like she said she would. Everyone handed in their slips, even Maverick, the school’s trouble maker. The teacher raised an eyebrow upon seeing his slip. It was surprising that his parents would let him go considering the trouble he got into on Tuesday.*

   *“Maverick,” she called, just as he was walking back to his desk. “Would you come back here for a second?”* 

   *Maverick gave a dramatic sigh and strolled back to the teacher’s desk.*

   *“What?”*

   *“I’m just surprised that your parents are letting you go to camp after what you did last week.”*

   *There was a shrug, but no other response from Maverick.*

   *“…Well?” The teacher tried again.*

   *“Well, what about it?”*

   *“Well, how did you convince your parents to let you go?” Another shrug. Maverick looked nonchalant, but he was sharper than most gave him credit for. He didn’t need to say anything; a permission slip was a permission slip.*

   *“Can I go back to my seat now? Everyone else’s waiting.”*

   *The teacher assented reluctantly and gave a hard look at Maverick’s permission slip. Maverick smiled to himself as he watched her from his desk. She could stare all she liked, but she wouldn’t be able to find anything wrong with it. Maverick had a look of utmost confidence afterwards, as he should, having practiced for so many hours.*

   *Once all the slips had come in, the teacher took a quick look through the stack to check if anyone had forgotten to hand theirs in. Sure enough, all the slips were there except…*

   *“Timothy,” the teacher called, “did you forget to hand in you slip?”*

   *Timothy, a very small, very pale boy with blonde hair so light it was almost white, perked up at the sound of his name.*

   *“I-I-I, n-no miss.”*

   *“Are you not coming then?”*

   *It was probably for the best. Timothy was hemophilic. A single scratch could be an emergency. Of course, all of the staff were well aware of the fact, so they took measures to ensure that Timothy stayed well away from any and all possible hazards.*

   *“A-actually, I h-haven’t been able to ask my p-parents yet.”* 

   *Also understandable. Timothy’s parents were both very busy with their jobs in the municipality, and he was such a shy kid too; it would be tough for him to ask.* 

   *“C-c-could I m-maybe hand it in on the day of? I-I’m sure I c-could get my parent’s s-signature during the w-weekend,” Timothy added quickly to explain his unusual request.*

   *“I’ll see what I can do.”* 

   *As long as that slip was signed, the teacher was quite happy to have Timothy on the camp trip. Timothy’s parents were very well respected in the town. It wouldn’t do to have them disappointed over a late permission slip. Although, she would have to keep a close eye on Timothy if he did come.*

561nal,4,2016-10-05,I recently applied for a job to take care for the mentally disabled - I have the interview on Friday.,justinmiko,aspergers,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/561nal/i_recently_applied_for_a_job_to_take_care_for_the/,"So, I have been diagnosed with Asperger's twice, and it has always affected my social life - I've always kind of been able to hide it to a certain degree, but with the increased stress from my current job I noticed it's particularly hard hiding it in public now a days. 

I have a current job as a Replenisher at a grocery store (have been working for that company ever since last year September - and have had 4 different positions within it - and am getting a Cashier position next week).

But despite me being there for a long time I always feel so incredibly stressed out at the end of the day, to a point where I personally believe it's taking an effect on my mental health.  I've been having increased feelings of depression (especially with this Replenisher position). 

The grocery department has a reputation for over-working their employees, and use me and my coworkers as tools to make us do their work (which gives us 6-8 hours overtime every week). 

So I asked for a new position within the store, they said they'd like me to be a backup checker (Which is technically a bagger + cashier), at this point anything would be better than a replenisher (besides a manager position). 

But anyways, I recently saw an ad come by on FB about a caring home for the mentally disabled, and since I had an internship in the Netherlands for a couple weeks (both NT children as well as mentally disabled teens), I know for certain that such a job is right up my alley (making a difference in someones life and creating bonds is honestly something I've always wanted to do.) The job would be M-F from 8-4, which I'd be okay with. 

But that poses a problem with my current job, as they are looking to get me upfront- and have been working on it for the last couple weeks. I also have insurance with my current company. 

The thought of having 2 jobs at the same time (that both require so much social contact) seems very daunting, but at this point (to keep my insurance with my current company), I'm thinking of doing both jobs. But if I had to choose one - I'd most certainly go after the caring home for sure. 

But anyways, with all the basic set-up out of the way - I have an interview for the caring home on Friday, and I really want to nail it!

So, is there any advice on how I should approach this interview?

I'm considering telling them that I have Asperger's - as a way to say that I can relate a bit more to the patients, but I've read it isn't smart to reveal something like that at the interview stage - so I'm thinking to drop that out. 

But should I also keep this current job if I happen to get the caring job? I'm honestly getting tired of being used by the managers within that store, and they always treat me as if I'm a simplton, which is rather hurtful for my self-esteem. But the HR department has put in so much effort to get me upfront that it would seem like a dick-move to just quit as soon as I do get it. So, how should I handle that situation? 

Also, any interview advice would be very welcome! Thanks in advance! :)"
561rxw,1,2016-10-05,How would you structure compensation tied to company performance (I'm negotiating it in a raise)?,equity-negotiation,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/561rxw/how_would_you_structure_compensation_tied_to/,"**TL;DR;** I want to be paid some amount based on how much the company is selling or profiting and my boss is open to it. What kind of arrangement should I suggest?

I'm the lead software developer of a small, private company in the midwest. My official title is Chief Technical Officer. In addition to software development I also handle all our technical infrastructure. I make $150,000 (give or take, for privacy) salary with 3% IRA match. No health insurance. Last year our company grossed about $3.5M. 

I want to negotiate my next raise to include some form of compensation tied to the company's performance so that as the company continues to grow my compensation automatically increases with it. How would something like this be structured? The first simple idea that comes to mind is a flat percentage of gross sales - like 1% of previous year's gross sales paid to me sometime in Q1. Does it need to be anymore complicated than that, or is there a better way that I should seek to structure it?

I already broached the subject with my boss when I asked for my last raise and he's open to it. For what it's worth he appreciates happy employees and strives to compensate people well. I started at $70k and was at $90k in 18 months. Then I left for a year for personal reasons (worked for the same boss on contract instead from home). I went back full time for $65k but that quickly rose and early this year I got my last raise to ~$150k after 4 years back. I ask for a raise about once a year and I don't know if I've ever gotten one less than $10k, the last two raises were nearly $20k each. 

Sometimes we get bonuses but it's totally random. One year we got three for a couple/few thousand each and other years we've gotten none. I'd also like to ensure I'm getting a large bonus type payment once (or a couple/few) times each year as a guaranteed part of my compensation.

I feel like I'm in a good bargaining position because if I do say so myself I think I killed it this year, implemented some great products and nailed some time-sensitive and ballooning scope custom work for a couple of very large customers. My efforts directly enabled the closing of at least $30k/month gross. We've also grown our developer numbers from 3 to 6 in less than a year and a half and I have more responsibility overseeing everyone and integrating new developers.

Last year we aimed for $3M gross and in Q4 it looked like we were going to surpass $3.5M. We usually have a presentation about the numbers each year but I don't think the files are available. I asked about doing another presentation this year but the boss is pretty busy so I don't know where we're at. I do know we've done quite well this year, signing a couple very large customers (to the tune of $30k/month). We've also added I think 3 full time people to the crew in 2016, moved into a bigger office, and we're about 18 months into switching a large part of our infrastructure to the cloud (at significantly increased cost).

I started in early 2010 and we were 6 people. Today we are 16 full time in the office and a few more part-time (one intern in and couple/few editors outside the office). We've grown a lot in the last 3-4 years, about doubled in size person-wise. Our gross sales have increased 30+% for the last 3 or 4 years in a row. We've been on lists like the Inc. 5000 and similar state-level lists for being one of the fastest growing private companies as well.

Our company is actually two companies - call them A Inc. and B inc.

I am the CTO of A Inc. and my most of my work is with A Inc. I do still work with B Inc. A Inc. is the most exciting and has the most potential for growth or any sort of ""sell out"" opportunity (my boss would sell if the price was significant enough but it's his baby and he'd want a big cash out).

A Inc. is a subscription based media and data service. We serve a particular industry and we've positioned ourselves as leaders in providing particular kinds of content to this industry. In 2010 we had a few hundred subscribers displaying our content in a few thousand locations. Today we have several thousand subscibers (under 10k) displaying our content in something like 100k locations worldwide. Our main data service application sees around 10 million requests per day.

Profit scales very well in A Inc. Our cost to produce content is often fixed and sometimes a percentage of its sales. Plus of course fixed costs like salaries and servers, etc. But ultimately our margins are quite high.

B Inc. used to be a general web dev shop where we made a variety of websites on contract, particularly custom e-commerce solutions. Our largest customer in B Inc. is the franchiser of a handful of retail chain stores. A few years ago we decided to reduce B Inc. to serving only this one single customer. B Inc. is maybe 1/3rd of our gross income and still growing, but we sometimes struggle with keeping up with the workload (plus I'd say the particularly good developers are pulled towards A Inc.) and there's always a looming threat of them going with other companies. That said, they'd be hard pressed to leave our system it would be an enormous undertaking for them. We've built a whole lot of software specific to their needs over the last decade.

562jat,93,2016-10-05,"Everything I own has been stolen, I'm on crutches and I'm financially independent. It's the first day of college. What do I do?",Wellthatjustwentdown,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/562jat/everything_i_own_has_been_stolen_im_on_crutches/,"So here goes…

I'm 23, support myself completely due to some pretty run of the mill dark and depressing parents (Drug addiction, abuse, prison!) and have been since I was about 19. I was admitted into UCLA at that time but due some even more exciting new life trauma took 3 years off and worked in various industries, did internships, went through some serious (mental) therapy and generally lived my life to the best of my ability.

1 year ago I had surgery on my foot for a bone spur, managed to save enough to take the 3 months off for recovery, came back and went to Community College and worked full time, and got into Columbia and UCSD (and others but this diatribe is too long already).

Around 6 months ago my foot/ankle started hurting again and it was revealed that my surgeon had performed a 30 year old medical procedure and as a result my tendon ripped and had begun subluxing (pulling off the bone, feels great, I highly recommend it). I continued to wait tables 20+ hours a week while attending school on this for 6 months in order to pay for the subsequent 6+ months of recovery I knew I needed once I was able to have the surgery.

I settled on UCSD due to the rather lovely scholarship I received from there which covers almost everything save roughly 11,000 on rent/food/etc, and considering I had bought/saved everything I could possibly need, I thought I would be good until I could start working again in January (hopefully).

2 weeks ago I had the surgery, packed everything I owned into my car (which I also bought myself) and drove down to sunny San Diego. I parked in front of my friends house, hobbled out on crutches and passed out on his couch.

In the morning I awoke with dreams of a new life only to crutch outside to a an empty parking spot and shattered glass.

Everything I own was in that car. Along with my passport, 3+ years of tax returns, 3+ years of medical records, computer, clothes, meds, all the free (unused) condoms I’d collected over the years from Planned Parenthood, etc.

I was on crutches and it was the first day of school and I literally own the clothes on my back, a pack of Big Red (got to stay fresh), and my backpack.

Guys, girls, and intersex members of the reddit community, I am terrified.

It’s gotten a little better, but I was near suicidal and was considering dropping out of school, luckily I wandered into a counseling office and the lady there was quite nice to me and calmed me down a bit. It might sound a little dramatic, but I’ve been through such an insane amount of shit to get to this point and to have everything taken from me is just a bit too much.

It’s been a week or so, and so far I’ve spent roughly $1000-1500 to re-buy textbooks, computer, bare minimum of clothes, and what not. I’ve still got more to buy, but I think I’m nearing the forced spending spree. This is in addition to paying the $500 to recover my stolen car, which was stripped, windows had been shattered, and everything inside taken. Mechanically it seems ok, but there are some odd noises and I’m not capable of paying for repairs at the moment. The rest of my savings is going to go pretty fast, as I had to move to a more expensive place closer to campus to be able to get to class, as the place I had been going to move in wasn’t bus accessible.

I’m trying very very hard to keep the anxiety down and just stay focused on school, but obviously the financial/life/stability circumstances of this are weighing on me. At the same time, I do feel free in some respects and there is a lovely lesson here on the meaningless of materialism.  Any advice on scholarships, avenues to get out this situation, and magical time machines would be deeply appreciated.

P.S. I have already frozen my credit, changed my account numbers, filed police reports and filed for a lost passport.

My question to everybody: What the fuck do I do here?

**TL;DR Life took a massive steaming shit on my face, crippled me and then stole all my stuff.**

(New account to avoid some truly horrendous identity crisis situation)

Edit: I didn't have renters insurance or theft on my car. Live and learn."

SN: I went through 3 GM's in the time I worked there.

Anyways, I had gotten approved to take a month off for an internship as I am a student. The day I was scheduled to leave, my GM fired me. At first she tried to say it was because I called in sick without MOD approval and no one to cover my prep shift but I showed her the messages I had with the MOD as well as getting someone to cover the last 4 hours of said shift. Then she tried to say that it was because I hadn't thrown up an hour before my shift and i was fine to come in. I had never called in sick before but I know that's not the rule.

I figured she had overheard that I didn't agree with the way she was running things and the people she was promoting and was thinking about switching stores so she fired me before I could quit.

In the same sentence she fired me she told me I was one of the best workers. It sucks because I really did love working for the company but the GM was moved up from SM and completely skipped apprentice and when I called corporate I never got a call back. She also played favorites up the ass.

I'm just really confused how I could be put on the no rehire when I've never been suspended, never missed work, always covered a shift when needed, and was never told I was bad at what I do.

Can someone help

tl;dr: fired for no reason and put on no rehire"
562yly,2,2016-10-05,Why does looks secretly matter,MeaningOfLife-Dream,depression_help,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/562yly/why_does_looks_secretly_matter/,"A lot of people say looks doesn't matter and it all depends on your skills. Have everyone ever thought because looks matter that people would make the good looking person more comfortable and more people easily approach them. I'm hideous, while one of my childhood friend is considered the most handsome man alive. My parents never cared about me and took extreme measures just to teach me such as locking me out of the house if I get low grades for a couple of hours during elementary school, while my handsome friend get low grade and his parents doesn't care too much about it. His looks make it easier for him to make friends cuz people want to talk to him regardless whether he has anything interesting to talk about or not. That look is very powerful. Me on the other hand, I suffered a bad childhood experience and no one approach me cause I'm hideous. One could say he wasn't a good friend cause he never realized this, but even though we knew each other for so long, we were never close. 

During HS, he was cutting for 3 years and people still worries about him. I didn't cut HS but felt so empty, no one worries about me. I didn't have much friends cause they were all his friends. Even now people abandoned me cause I wasn't good looking or anything. He graduated HS on time cause of all the independent study that the school provided him, but I wonder now if I cutted would I had made better connections. Most of the people still remember him even tho he was never around.

During college, we both went separate college at first but then he later transferred over to the same college as me. At first I thought everything changed and I was able to be more independent and find a group I belong to. But it wasn't the case, even though I temporary connected with some clubs in school, everyone wanted to meet him when he transferred. I worked hard to find an accounting internship that take me, but my GPA was pretty low so it was hard to find one. His was much lower than mines but people were more willing to hook him up as a way to meet him rather than because he trust him. Now I'm working at retail, while he working as a bank teller. His look saved his life, but my hideous appearance killed my life. I feel so empty lately, I been researching on how to make poison to end my own life. Darwinism is cruel against the world, and nothing can save me from it. Before this entire text, I told him how I really felt and I secretly hated him. I told him everything about how empty I was and even if he said we were close, we were never close to begin with.

He pretending to be a good person told me not to end my life and keep going, but what does life have with an hideous person like myself. Yea, life keep going on and eventually something will come up, but have you ever thought that no one really cares about you until you actually die and disappear. I wish one day that when I die, I'll be reincarnated to a more handsome individual but I'll never find out. "

instead i chose to remain quiet all day at school and run back home to my computer the moment my classes were over. i was depressed and alone and often did not have the energy to go to school. i missed lectures and did terrible on my tests. i barely passed all my classes and now i'm about to graduate, but once i leave the safety of school i will be alone and inexperienced in the real world. i will have no friends and no job. my parents will question what i did the past 5 years to end up in this situation and i won't know what to say. maybe that i did nothing. nothing to break out of my shyness and try new things. i took no risks and only sought safety and comfort, and because of that i will have neither by the end of the year.

Over the past 6 months or so we went from just interacting (in a close friendly way) at work, to playing online games together multiple times per week, to finally hanging out multiple times per week and talking on the phone for hours at a time. It seemed to me that we were getting very close to starting a relationship.

This has all changed in the past few weeks as office politics have shaken things up. The team that we are both on is set to be disbanded at the end of the year, forcing us to look for new positions. I have found one at a different company in the city, while she has a team at our original company that wants to hire her. She is not incredibly excited about the position, but it's a good job with good pay.

Since this work drama began, she has been spending more and more of her weekends visiting her family in a rural town a couple hundred miles from here. Coinciding with her visits has been a distance between us (far less hanging out and deep conversations) and her exploration of positions in this small town near her family. The particular position she is looking at is a significant downgrade in pay and career opportunities, but I think that it is currently her preferred choice.

I think that this decision to try to move back to her family is being heavily pushed by her family. All of her older sisters are stay-at-home mothers, while she is in her late 20s and unmarried. She also (after she began visiting more often) has gone on a couple of (low-key) dates with a guy from her family's church. So far nothing serious has come of it, but it informs my conclusion.

Now that background is out of the way, I get to my dilemma/ask. I think that her (very traditional) family is taking advantage of this work uncertainty to try to push her to move back to them and start a family. This hurts me because she has become my best friend over the past year and I really hate to see her leaning toward following their advice. She is incredibly skilled at her job and it would be a horrible waste for her to give it up for something worse. Additionally, she has become a very important part of my life that I had been thinking was going to be either a lifelong friend or potential romantic partner.

I see two options before me, and really need to make a choice before this tears at me anymore (it has already brought back depression that had been absent for almost two years):

1. I can let her go. I think that if I do not act in any way that she will likely move away in a few months.
2. I can try to make a personal appeal for her to stay. This bothers me because it is ultimately a selfish request (""Stay here because I don't want you to leave""), but I feel that it has a decent chance of making her at least strongly consider staying. Other, more career-based appeals are already being made by other coworkers (I am not the only one who thinks this move is a bad idea).

What choice do you think I should go with?

  **tl;dr**: Best friend and crush of nearly a year is likely to move far away because of (suspected) family pressure to settle down and start a family."

I will give a basic overview of what’s been happening, then some further details after. The events I describe started around June 15th, 2016 up until now. Please, if you have experienced, are experiencing, or know anything about DP/DR, I am reaching out to you. Here goes…
I woke up from a short sleep after a night out and headed to work. I felt pretty tired and foggy but chalked that up to a hangover. But for some reason over the next few days the feeling intensified. I was getting hazier and more worried by the day. About three days after I started feeling like this, I was on my way home from work when suddenly a horrible feeling came over my body. My legs got heavy, it was hard to move, and my heart was skipping beats so hard I was gasping for air. Having a minor history with heart issues I thought something might be seriously wrong. I sat down on a bench and called 911. Ambulance came and took my blood pressure and did an EKG on the way to the hospital. They said the results were normal. The doctors did some more tests on my heart and blood and said those were normal as well. They weren’t really taking me seriously until my heart rate spiked. My monitor started beeping and a bunch of hospital staff rushed in. I was breathing fast, and I guess I hyperventilated because an intense pins and needles feeling shot down both my arms, my hands clamped shut and I couldn’t move them and I couldn’t stop twitching my leg. Scariest moment of my life, I thought I was about to check out. They hooked my IV up to some anxiety med or sedative and I eventually calmed down, but still didn’t feel right. They kept me overnight for observation but nothing else happened and they let me go in the morning. Here’s where the depersonalization/derealization kicks in. After the hospital I felt like I was in a different world. I was in a complete fog and it felt like I was in some new form of reality that didn’t seem real, like I was in Purgatory. Everything was a blur, literally. I became completely self-aware, watching my feet walk and my hands do things, but felt like I was just watching, not really doing the things I was. It is very similar to watching a video from a first-person point of view, like when someone has a GoPro strapped to their head. I would look myself in the mirror and be completely confused. Anything and everything seemed totally unfamiliar. Family, friends, objects, activities, I was completely losing my grip on reality. It was impossible to hold eye contact while having a conversation without freaking out. I just couldn’t get out of my own head, constantly thinking that I had brain damage, schizophrenia, a neurological disorder – something. I became a serious hypochondriac, thinking every little thing I felt go on with my body was a sign of death. The number of physical symptoms has been endless. Heart palpitations and skipped beats, relentless sleep-starts (jolting awake in a panic as I was about to fall asleep), heavy limbs, fatigue, you name it. I continued to go to work, although I probably shouldn’t have, but did because I got a really nice internship and didn’t want to screw up my future. The days flew by in a blur, and my memory is completely shot. A lot of the time I can’t even remember what it was like to feel normal, but I know it wasn’t this. One of the scarier parts has been the floods of existential questions and worry that flash by. I question reality, God, existence, and the very foundations of life. I can’t stop myself from thinking about how my conciseness is merely the result of chemical reactions and fluids in my brain which is being carried around by a fleshy vessel which is eventually going to die. It’s absolutely terrifying. After about two and half months my internship ended and my stress levels started to go down, then my symptoms slowly started to change. I was on a weekend vacation with my girlfriend who I had not seen all summer, since she was away on a school trip. I remember briefly leaving the hotel room to go downstairs and ask the front desk to borrow a pair of scissors. I was on my way back up to the room when for a split second my mind went completely blank, and I stumbled to the floor, catching myself on the wall. I was terrified on the inside but was trying to hold it together so my girlfriend didn’t think I had lost my mind while she was away. The same thing happened again a few minutes later when looking myself in the mirror in the bathroom. Weirdly, after these near collapses the fog that had had my brain in a choke hold for the past few months felt like it had let go a bit. I did not feel normal again by any means, but…different. The rest of the summer went by and I returned to school. By this point the haze that had surrounded me had pretty much disappeared, but the derealization and feeling of being outside of myself and detached from reality has not. Actually, without the fog, this sensation feels even more vivid and disturbing. I will be sitting in class listening to my professor lecture, but my mind will feel like scrambled eggs, I’ll look around the room and classmates who’ve I known for years will look like aliens to me, and a constant fear looms over me. A new symptom that has arisen recently, and that is a completely blank mind/confused state when I wake up. I open my eyes in the morning and I not only not know who or where I am, but what I am and what is around me. This lasts for only a few seconds before my brain starts to turn on, but it is still really scary. Since my first initial hospital visit, I have seen a cardiologist, three regular physicians, and another ER visit. My cardiologist was the only one who sympathized with me, and she gave me 0.25mn Xanax, about 20 pills, to take if my symptoms got bad. I took at least one a day for the next couple weeks, as my anxiety/panic/DP/DR were completely constant. They helped a little. After my most recent trip to a physician, she gave me some more 0.25mg Xanax to hold me over. They don’t help as much anymore. The latest ER visit was brought about by the feelings described above, but really intense. I needed to step out of class as it felt like my brain was about to implode. I got a drink, splashed some water on my face in the bathroom, and nearly collapsed again, catching myself on the counter. Be extremely worried and fed up I pulled it together as best I could and drove to the hospital, only to leave upset and virtually hopeless. I checked in and, while sitting on a hospital bed with my sense of self completely non-existent, feeling like my brain had been pulled from my head and was floating above my body, explained what happened. I got another EKG witch came back normal, and standard bloodwork which was normal as well. The doctors helped me set up appointments with a neurologist and a psychiatrist, but said there was no point in me being there. They didn’t give me any medication. I have another standard doctor appointment in a few days but the neurologist and psychiatrist are a week or two away. What is going on with me? How do I keep my brain from racing and get rid of this feeling that something is terribly wrong? It has been going on for almost four months now and I feel like I am losing control. Please let me know if you have any advice.

Information I’m not sure is relevant but will include anyway.

•	On two separate occasions of smoking a small amount of marijuana, my heart began racing, my mind was in a paranoid frenzy, thinking everyone was talking about me or relating everything to God. It felt like my brain was going haywire. After a while I began to cool down, but then, ON BOTH OCCATIONS, I felt a warm, slow stream of liquid start coming from my right ear. I know I did not hallucinate this or anything because placed my finger in my ear and my finger was wet. Still being in a pretty paranoid state, I thought my brain was leaking or I was losing spinal fluid or something. My foggy state and DP/DR started about 2-3 days after the second time this happened. I have completely stopped smoking pot since then.
•	Around the time of my second ER visit, I started to feel a pressure in my ears, like the kind when you fly on a plane. My ears haven’t stopped popping since. They pop every time I swallow. Now, this could very well be paranoid/hypochondriac me desperately searching for answers. I just find it odd how this started to happen around the same time my symptoms began to change, and how this all started shortly after I had a weird liquid come from my ear after smoking.

5646tv,5,2016-10-06,Anxiety affecting my career,Throwaway19284628,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/5646tv/anxiety_affecting_my_career/,"My anxiety is becoming unmanageable at work. Mostly at my internship. I'm in a graduate program where we have an internship requirement to graduate. My current placement is at a large government institution. The branch I'm working in is newly merged, and not well managed. Everyone is burnt out and stressed. Tensions have been building, and this week culminated in the most hostile branch meeting I've ever encountered. I thought I'd have a panic attack right then and there. I made an excuse and left the meeting, and ever since have been incredibly anxious. So much so that I'm making excuses not to go in, leave early, or blow off my work. It's like my brain would rather just shut down then deal with the tense situation. I'm disappointed because a month into the internship, they expressed a want to hire me. Now, assuming I don't undermine that relationship first, if they were to hire me, I'm positive I wouldn't thrive in that environment. Additionally, my husband is unemployed. We're running out of savings. I'm not sleeping. I have GI issues. I feel like I'm barely holding myself together, and any moment I'll break."
5669xn,0,2016-10-06,[F4M] The Basic Protocol - New World Order,Dark-eyed-dragon,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5669xn/f4m_the_basic_protocol_new_world_order/,"""War"" may be a bit of an exaggeration, but anyone who claims that Western society is living in racial harmony has their head buried in the sand. Just turn on the news, the US, Europe, it's the same story everywhere. It's not anyone's fault, really- we're genetically designed to associate with those like us. But we're also designed to compete and conquer...

Let's introduce the Black Broadcast Capitalist Enterprises. International underground firm that is part of almost every market imaginable. News broadcasting, commercials, auctioning, farming, construction, law, politics, the film industry, sports... Everything. Though they always have cover-ups, ghost companies used to hide them from true sight. Most of the world has slowly been taken over by BBCE, and now they control enough to start moving.

Nearly every employee for the BBCE and their underling companies is of African descent, and the ones that aren't are very attractive white girls. Well, they weren't very attractive white girls at the start, but the BBCE works in the research industry and the cosmetic industry, and also the plastic surgery industry. They are very attractive now. Though they don't date, they deny any man that talks to them. Apart from a black man. And then if a girl talks to them, well, they'll introduce them to that high-paying secretary job at BBCE, and the cycle continues...

Now, however, they can start their original goal. To make the Black Race supreme. They've always been working towards this goal. Money is funneled into interracial porn productions, sent as child support payments to Black men and the women they breed, used to fund tuition for Black students to attend historically white colleges and universities and support the propaganda spewing Tumblr blogs they write filled with smut. In fact, BC Enterprises is the largest source of funding for the advancement of the Black race the world has ever seen- and it's working. Only, they are ready to launch a new initiative.

the Basic Protocol. Designed to target basic white girls, ones that are cute and the ones that are stunningly hot, the goal is that by the end of the year, nearly every white girl will dream of BBC stretching them out and being filled with the superior sperm. Of course, that takes time... And testing. If people suddenly get suspicious of the copious amounts of interracial porn that they can watch, targeted towards them in particular... No, the BBCE got to where they are now by patience and waiting. They were slaves by these stupid white men, now they'll enslave them. Only, they won't realize they are being enslaved until all their women are breeding black children and every job is taken by the superior black race.

The BBCE control everything, as mentioned above. And when I say everything... I truly mean everything! Every market, every business, everything is managed and monitored. If the BBCE want a famous celebrity to go black, for example Kim Kardashian... They start to influence her. Replace her friends' thoughts and let her friends convert her. Whisper in her ear. And then they put down their hand-made celebrity Kanye West to sweep in and finish the job. Now, millions of teens on instagram look up to Kim, and her sexy black husband...

This is only an example. The first step to the project is to pick a fresh target. I am sure that you boys can find a nice picture of a pretty girl who is ready to be tested and moulded into her ideal image! Then, the influence begins. Start replacing boys in her school with black ones, have her watch her crush get beaten up by a gang of muscular black guys. Surround her with pretty black men and... Her friends. Her friends will be converted in advance, on a more... Enhanced version of the protocol. Sped up. Her friends already love black cock and eagerly work for BBCE. They giggle and point out things like how much bigger and more dominant black men are...

And then they steer it towards sexual conversation. Is it true that black men are bigger? Is it true that once you go black, you can't go back? Stuff like this. Questions that keep our target up at night, pondering about them... At this point, we'll begin to convert her family. Take the men of the house out, her brothers and father, replace them with a new black step-father. This is a long process, but the black agent who will play as the step-father will begin to play subliminal messaging and hypnotic videos that are disguised as films. Ones that get her horny as the sex scenes get steamier, the ones that make her close her eyes at night, but not for sleeping.

Then we amp it up after a few weeks of this. After this amount of time, she's into black guys. But still into whites... And that can't do. We'll make her give a BJ or have sex with a white guy and his tiny penis, and then afterwards, a few days later, have her accidently walk into her step-father, or maybe find a beefed out black guy in the gym showers... Maybe asked on a date from the basketball player in school. And they'll get it on, slowly but surely.

She should have her first black cock within two weeks of amping it up. Then, we give her more black cock, and tiny white cock as well. From there, she'll make her choice. We'll get her addicted to the stunning pleasure of BBC, and then the BBCE will give her an internship at one of their prestigious offices, far away from her family. There, they'll pump her up into an airheaded bimbo secretary and... Rinse and repeat. Until they get the formula for the Basic Protocol down.

Then... They can release it upon the world.

---

The best message to me would be starting off the roleplay by writing about one of the girls. You'll play any man that comes up, and the world and how it reacts to the Basic Protocol, but also about the brainwashing and the effects it has on the four girls! So mentioning how they find themselves thinking about black men... Stuff like that. I'm more likely to ignore you if you don't write a response to the roleplay and get stuck in straight away, just because I can see your writing talent and whether we'll be a good match!"
5669zf,6,2016-10-06,"Love SO, but blending families is so hard.",dummybumbum,stepparents,https://www.reddit.com/r/stepparents/comments/5669zf/love_so_but_blending_families_is_so_hard/,"I have been with SO for over 3 years now.  We aren't married yet, but we have been living together for more than half of our relationship.  He is an amazing guy.  He is great to my son (14).  I am up-and-down with his daughter (6).  I despise her BM.  I think she is a negligent mother.  

I know I still do great things for my son, for my SO, and sometimes for his daughter.  I am stable for my son.  I can't seem to extend it 100% of the time to his daughter.  It is for this reason that, for the first time in my life, I am not proud of myself. 

My son is not perfect, but he is a damn good kid.  His dad was a great dad and the primary caregiver before our divorce because I was the primary breadwinner and attending University.  My SO has handled my ex with such grace and composure and compassion since the very beginning.  He handles my son with incredible care, love, and consideration.  My ex has been on a steady downward spiral since our divorce.  The most recent issue with my ex has been difficult (DUI, jail time, drug addiction).  The other night when I was talking to my son about how he felt about all the stuff going on, he was hopeful and rooting for his dad's rehab.  But he knew my SO and I were fighting.  And it was only when he asked me if we were breaking up that he got teary-eyed.  He loves my SO.  He looks up to him.  He feels safe and loved by him.  My SO has been an example to me that I know I am not matching.

It's difficult when everything I do garners the response, ""My mom does...."".  She's only 6.  Understandably, her mom still walks on water.  I love that my son feels the same way about me still.  Yes, in my heart of hearts, I want her to feel that way about her mom.  But, to me, her mom is negligent.  And I am very hurt and angry that her negligent mother gets this absolute adoration when she doesn't deserve it.  And, yes, I know there are differences in people's expectation of what ""a good mother"" is.  I know that if I were to call child services, nothing would happen.  I have to accept that for a little 6-YRO it doesn't matter that her dad and I are always stepping up to make sure she has everything she needs.  It doesn't matter to her that her mom would rather buy a bass for herself rather than buy clothes that fit her daughter.  It doesn't matter to her that she's been in school since August and that it was only yesterday her mom finally got her a ONE full uniform (one shirt and one pant) for school.  It doesn't matter that she has had to come to our house every morning and change into uniform and will have to continue to do so except for ONE day a week.  It doesn't matter that her mom doesn't bathe her regularly.  It doesn't matter to her that the custody schedule is ""50/50"", but that it's only 2 Sundays per month that she doesn't spend time at our home.  It doesn't matter to her that for three years her mother refused to give up her Friday (party/play) nights and/or Saturday (""my only day to sleep in"") mornings so that her dad could work and I could complete a required internship in order to graduate.  It doesn't matter to her that her mother leaves her with people without telling us and we only find out because we call to talk to her and her mother has to tell us that she's not with her - or her daughter tells us after-the-fact.

It only matters that she feels loved by her mother when her mother does actually spend time with her.  

Yes, her mother has made improvements in the last three years.  Yes, her mother does now give her at least one bath while she's with her.  Yes, her mother will never be the mother that I want this little girl to have, and that despite all my efforts, I will never hold the same light her mother does.  The most important thing to this 6-YRO when we go out in public together is that people know that I am not her mother.  Yes, I know that I am not her mother.  Technically, I'm not even her stepmother because we aren't married.  But does she really have to announce it unsolicited?  She has literally said, ""Hi, I'm (name) and this is not my mom."" Ouch.  It's not even ""Hi, I'm (name) and this is my friend.""  If someone mistakenly calls me her mom, she yells (and I mean yell), ""She's not my mom!""  She has silenced an entire salon and made every person look down at the floor rather than look at me in the face.

Yes, I know. I am the adult.  I should bear this and continue to make the right choices and hold my emotions in check.  I know I am not perfect either.  I am probably doing as much wrong as her mom is.  I'm about to the point of just not being home whenever she is present because I am just so damn hurt and I just don't know what to do anymore.  I'm walking on eggshells.  She's walking on eggshells.  My SO is walking on eggshells.  I am in therapy because I have so much residual anger from my childhood and my previous marriage.  Some days it is all I can do to get out of bed.  Some days I have so much hope I feel like I can more than do this - I can conquer it.  But the former has become the status quo and the latter is occasional.  

So how come I hold it completely together with my son, and I can't extend it to her?  She's just as innocent as my son.  I am so embarrassed and disappointed in myself for failing like this.  I thought I was better than this.

This is so damn hard."

Last night they came to my school (Bill's great-grandparents founded the college) for a live interview. They were so charming and wonderful. They were so funny and gave great advice not only to TV writing, producing, and acting specifically, but to work ethics. To never let your ego get in your way, and to never get lazy. (They said it much more artfully than I, of course.)

I got to talk to them afterwards for like 45 minutes while they answered specific questions from me and my classmates. They're as personable as you could ever dream. I was blown away by how at-ease they made me feel (I usually get so starstruck and lose my words).

To be able to shake Bill's hand and tell him how much his work meant to me, and for him to express his thanks (so many celebrities are jaded by it, but he's one of the exceptions) so meaningfully and sincerely... it meant the world to me. He gave me such solid advice on internships and recommendations that left me with incredibly newfound empowerment.

To be able to shake Christa's hand and tell her how fantastic I think she is (being the iconic Jordan AND MUSIC SUPERVISOR aka **the honest reason I am here and alive today**), and for her to tell me that I'm going to pay her back next semester by meeting and convincing their daughter to attend this school... How cool are they?! 

**TL;DR: Bill and Christa invalidate the notion that you should never meet your heroes. Meet them and be blown away.**"

It started off as an internship where everything was going really well - learning a lot, i'd a lot of time to explore my field and get to know what I could possibly do in the future.

The day I went full-time, things changed. I was put on the small boring jobs. I was hassled for work constantly with impossible deadlines. I was never thanked or praised for all the great work I constantly put in. If I was a few minutes late, he complained. If I left on time he complained that I seemed uninterested about the work (??!?!?!?!?!). I ignored the passive aggressive comments made about me when I wasn't in the room. ""He's so lazy..He's a spacer.. He's a sadcase.."".

Today I called in sick and my boss straight away accused me of lying and brought the workload up straight away. There was a 6 hour gap between when i called and when he responded (morning and closing time). I had to go to the doctors as I'd a problem with my heart due to intense stress and anxiety. I've had mental health issues for the last while and work related stress was the main problem. I'm incredibly ill at the moment and I somehow manage to crawl into that hell hole every morning but this is it.. Best of luck to you, and your business, you can't bully me anymore, my notice is in, my sick note is in and I'm packing up before you come in.. I QUIT.

On the plus side I've something else lined up!"

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Headroom_broadcast_signal_intrusion): 

The Max Headroom broadcast signal intrusion was a television signal hijacking that occurred in Chicago, Illinois, United States on the evening of November 22, 1987. It is an example of what is known in the television business as broadcast signal intrusion. The intruder was successful in interrupting two broadcast television stations within the course of three hours. After a brief and only partially successful attempt to break into the signal of intended target of WGN-TV, the signal pirates, whose identities were never found, succeeded in getting their broadcast intruded onto WTTW during an episode of the Doctor Who serial ""Horror of Fang Rock."" The pirate broadcast, which lasted 90 seconds and was pre-recorded on videotape, featured an individual disguised as television character Max Headroom parodying WGN and television in general. The incident made national headlines and the people responsible have never been identified. This is the best known broadcast hijacking, due to the oddity, the same people interrupting two TV stations, and utilizing the mask of a famous TV character in the intrusion.

Six years ago, a Redditor came forward with info [claiming](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/eeb6e/i_believe_i_know_who_was_behind_the_max_headroom/) he knew who was responsible.

Last year, he [revealed](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsolvedMysteries/comments/3oaxi5/new_developments_in_the_max_headroom_incident/) that the people who originally ""accused"" were ruled out, claiming that after further investigation the incident would have to have been done by someone inside the broadcast industry, not his civilian friends.

So what do you make of all this? Could it have been someone from within one of the attacked stations, or a local competitor? My money is actually on a local broadcasting collage student or intern, based on the maturity level of the humor involved. I would love to hear some more theories on this, now that it's been a full year since any news.

Mr. James Goodman, multi-billionaire owner sat in his office behind the dark mahogany desk. The room was massive but empty and cold. Even the sky was a cloudy grey, so the floor to ceiling windows allowed in dull light. Mr. Goodman was not working. That is to say, not doing work for Good Pharmaceuticals, though he considered this work much more important. It was two weeks into the summer intern program and he was looking over all the fresh faces that were hired this summer, not their applications, but through the webcams on their computers. He was looking for ones that showed potential to be brought into an 'accelerated program'.

In the middle of the display was Claudia Busker, a beautiful 20 year old. According to her file she was studying economics, but he didn’t really care about that. But what he cared about was her behaviour. She hadn’t been late yet  and always finished her tasks ahead of time. She also had a certain fire in her eyes when she worked. *She should do just fine* James mused. Claudia’s  gorgeous Nordic look – blond hair, deep blue eyes – didn’t hurt either.

Just then erupted a coughing sound from beneath the desk. Mr. G frowned, pressed a button on his desk which resulted in a muffled yelp. “Number 1-0-7-6 was getting sloppy, and not in a good way,” James thought to himself. James was referring to the gimp chained under his desk. It too had been an intern not too long ago. Now it was covered from head to toe in tight leather, the only part of it visible was the inside of its mouth, but that was usually wrapped tightly around its master’s cock. #1076’s other holes were plugged as well, fitted with electrodes to administer punishing shocks for poor behaviour.

Mr. G pressed another button, this time the intercom. “Come.” His voice was gentle, yet firm. He didn’t bark his order, but it was clear it wasn’t a suggestion. Moments later the door to his office opened. His assistant, Miriam, strode in. She had not been an intern, but a toy he had bought himself in Japan a few years back. He was so impressed by her, he even gave her a human name.  She wore a tight top threatening to burst and a pencil skirt that hugged her legs down to her knees. Though the skirt restricted her movement, Miriam walked perfectly on the 10 inch stilettos. Each step was precise and the click of shoe on marble echoed through the room. She stopped at his desk, hands behind her back, head looking straight forward.

""I've made my decision. These are the ones I want."" He handed Melissa a small stack of folders. Claudia’s name lined the folder on top. She took the papers, “Yes, Sir. Right away.” Melissa turned around and Mr. Goodman gave her a nice hard slap on the ass as she walked back out. James turned his attentions back to Claudia. He hoped she would be receptive to the training, he’d rather have her sooner than having to wait for her to be broken. He administered two quick shocks to #1076 and he could feel it immediately impaling itself on his cock, deepthroating him. It held its position and James revelled in how it spasmed, desperate for air"

Why is she breaking up with me and what to do from here?",kappamaki12,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/568kri/my_20m_girlfriend_19f_of_1_year_broke_up_with_me/,"I am new to Reddit and made an account for this. Please bear with me.


I met my girlfriend at the beginning of Sophomore year in college. I knew from the moment I saw her, I fell in love and getting to know her personality made me even more drawn to her and that she was the one I want to be with for very long time. I approached her and we hit it off very well. In 1 month, we began dating and things were going well until summer break. This was my first relationship and 3rd for her, which the other two ended in her boyfriends breaking up with her.


I thought it would be a great idea to surprise and take her to Disneyland for our one year anniversary, so I decided to look for internship to get money for it, which I did with great effort. I was able to get enough money for the trip to Disneyland and bought one year anniversary necklace.

Since I was in another country over the summer, for the first half of the summer, we skyped and texted often; however, second half, I was so busy with my internship, It was getting difficult to skype and text her. 


When I came back from the summer break, I moved in and after long day of moving things around, I finally met up with her. I tried to hug her but she didn't move. I thought that's a bit weird... I took her back to my room and I gave her all the gifts I brought back(everything but necklace and Disneyland trip surprise). I then tried to hug her... She didn't move. That's when I noticed something was wrong. She broke up with me that day.


The main reason she told me was that she doesn't think she can meet my expectations and my family's. And that getting reminded to do things was too much.

I didn't agree with that(as I did not have much expectation that  I was pushing on her) and not a reason to breakup of of blue. I talked to her a week later asking what her real reasons were. We talked for 4 hours. She mentioned that its gonna be hard finding time and what not, but in the end, it was that she needed to figure herself out. She needed more close friends at school and be independent. At least that's what I settled for.


The thing is we both still love each other. (I don't exactly know what she means by love at this point.) 


We told each other that if we really are meant to be, we will be back together once she figures herself out.
The problem is that we don't know how long it takes for her to figure herself out and its not something you can measure. I don't even know when I can approach her again. At least she said she wouldn't date anyone for a while either way. We are still friends at the moment. 


What should I do? I don't know if the reasons were the actual reasons she broke up with me. I really want to get back together with her. I can't give up on someone so beautiful and kind, especially if she still have feelings for me.

Should I be patient and wait for her to be ready? the thing is it is not guaranteed that she will be together with me. Now, she wants to be back together with me, but after long time, she might go for someone else. 

Besides, what do I even do with all this love for her? the hole in the chest that I can not close? I am very depressed, broken-hearted, and don't know what to do.

I need advice on what I should do from here. I really want to get back together but I also do not want to wait for a year or more just to see her get together with someone else.

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: gf of 1 year break up with me. We both still have feelings for each other. Should I wait til she is ready to be together again, risking all the time I will have to wait for her?"

A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused.

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

----------------

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

The prompt above doesn't have to be the start or involved in it... just an example of some writing.

Can be different and have a male celebrity and their journey. (Check out my 'Famous Life' posting in my post history for that)

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Megan Fox, Margot Robbie, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba. Though.. the female celebrity can be an original character that is made up would love her to look like Madison Ivy or Lana Rhoades though also into Lindsey Pelas, Emily Sears and Claudia Alende.

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

P.S Also have a recent posting in which I mention all the rp's and things I'm interested in for a long term rp, so check that out if you want, particularly interested in doing a Marvel Black Widow RP or a Post apocalyptic/dystopia world that is similar to Fallout or a Bioshock rp. Also a Walking Dead rp.

568opq,0,2016-10-06,When is an acceptable time to take a loss in a stock?,Batvatar,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/568opq/when_is_an_acceptable_time_to_take_a_loss_in_a/,"So i've been thinking about this for a long time, and figured i'd take the time to ask the question.. here is the scenario..

about 3 years ago, I decided to invest heavily in marijuanna stocks (heavy for me at least).. i took roughly 3k and turned it into about 8K in profits. I decided to cash out before they all dropped. These were all short sales so i had the stock for less than a year and paid taxes on my earnings. All of the stocks eventually went back down, and i decided to take my earnings and reinvest in the same stocks again in hopes they would go back up.. so i put almost all of the money back into the same ones.. they all tanked... so basically ive been sitting on the tanked stocked for about 2+ years now... never moving, never selling or buying more.. they are just sitting there worth about 1k... so the questions is...

if i sell now, i'll take a pretty hefty loss of probably 4K+..... i know this, and you may be saying, why sell just wait it out... 

well i've hit some money troubles recently due to some family issues, so that 1K is something i really need right now... Now on to my question... 

i'm having a hard time financially right now and i need every advantage i can get.. i need the 1K, but i also need to not get eaten alive come tax time... i heftily put money in my 401k and have been since i was 22 (i'm 30 now).. i always put 7+% of my income in my 401k.. so i can count on that during tax time to drive my AGI down.. i also have student loans, and i've maxed out on the interest paid to them that can be deducted which i believe is 2,500$... so here's the rub... i'm making more money this year than i ever have before, but i'm paycheck to paycheck right now because i'm supporting my gf of 7 years while she does an very good unpaid internship (Which will be worth it in the end)... as well as other family members.. 

sooooo, basically...

is now a good time to take this loss, when i need the money the most? the way i see it.. i'll get my 1K and take 4K+ in loss on stocks i have had for almost 3 years... so that 4K loss... Could? or could not? be deducted from my AGI this coming tax season?

TL:DR

will taking a loss on my stocks held longer than 2+ years be advantageous if i really need the money now, and need my AGI reduced this tax season?"
568zna,8,2016-10-06,"Me [28F] with my brother [24M], it's been two years since he graduated college, and moved in with my mom [49F]; he still hasn't found a job and we don't know how to talk to him about it anymore.",broneedsajob,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/568zna/me_28f_with_my_brother_24m_its_been_two_years/,"Throwaway because brother reddits. Basically, my younger brother, Ron, has had trouble finding a job since graduating from college. 


Ron graduated in December 2014 with two science degrees, and wanted to get into research of some sorts and eventually wanted to become a PA. After a year he still had not found a job, and realized that he was lacking some certifications needed for the type of research jobs he wanted (no idea what, that's just what he told me and my mom).


Ron decided to get certified as a Phlebotomist through a program at one our local community colleges. He finished that program in May, which included an internship and certification test. He passed the physical portion of the test and then several weeks later passed the written portion. It's been five months since the program ended and he still hasn't found anything. 


He was able to pay for the program because my grandpa (70M) gave him a loan to do so. My grandpa owns his own business, and my brother does do work for him once a week, and then one or two weekends a month when there are shows they are selling at. So nothing sustainable, but it allows Ron to earn a little cash so that he can pay some of his bills each month. Otherwise my mom covers the majority of his expenses. 


Today my Mom called me and told me that my brother seemed more ""grumpy"" than usual, and wondered if I knew what that was all about. Ron and I had just gotten back yesterday from a short road trip, and she wondered if we had talked about his job situation at all. I told her that we hadn't because in the past anytime I've tried to talk to him about it he immediately gets defensive and stonewalls me or whoever is trying to talk to him. My mom said that Ron told her that he feels like working for my grandpa gets in the way of him applying for jobs, and so that was one reason why he wasn't working the show this weekend. Another reason he wasn't working it was that this particular show is a slower one and is therefore ""boring."" 


I understand that he is frustrated. But what I don't understand is how unappreciative he is. Not everyone has a relative they can go earn some money from while they're down on their luck. Not everyone's mom would be willing to pay for the majority of their expenses as an adult. I get that my grandpa's business can be quite dull, and that spending a weekend at a show is a drag. I get that living at home with your mom as an adult is frustrating and can make you feel like you lack independence. What I don't get is his crappy attitude towards both these situations. Many times when my mom asks Ron to help out around the house he gets angry and tells her no. My mom travels a lot and when she comes back she often finds the house and her car dirty. Asking him to complete simple household tasks (clean, grocery shopping, etc) will often get a reaction from Ron that is seriously mind boggling. He pays no rent, most of his food and some of his monthly bills are paid for by my mom. You'd think he'd be grateful and be able to help out around the house in order to somewhat ""repay"" my mom for her generosity.  


I have tried to speak with Ron and tell him that while he continues to look for jobs related to his education, maybe he should also apply to retail, food and other such jobs so that he can add job experience to his resume (he has basically none) and earn more money than what he gets via my Grandpa's shop. Literally everyone I know has had to do this after they graduated from college. I *still* don't have a job related to my bachelors, and I probably never will. And it took me until very recently (so 6ish years since graduating from college) to get a ""career worthy"" job with benefits and decent salary. It took my husband two years to find a job in his field, and during those two years he worked retail. I have several other friends who have all gone through this same exact cycle (hell most of us millennials get the pleasure of doing this) and Ron knows them all. So there is no lack of good example of how the system works, and yet... here we are. I know first hand that working crappy jobs with low hourly wages blows. But they also provide some sense of accomplishment, no matter how small. And they give you skills and job experience, things Ron lack currently. 


So, I guess what I'm looking for here is some advice about how my mom and I can have a conversation with Ron in a constructive way to help him get on track, and to avoid him getting defensive and angry about it. I know my mom won't cut him off or kick him out, so some suggestions about how we can get him to see that while he is unemployed, he needs to be more *willingly* helpful around the house would also be appreciated.

Need advice. Thanks!

I (18F) am in my sophomore year of college. Prior to college, I lived with my Nmom and three brothers. On the weekends, I stayed with my dad. Last year, when I started college, I began LC with my Nmom, but went home every weekend to my dad's house. Over the winter break, I stayed at her house for two weeks, and at my dad's the second two weeks. My dad and full brother (17M) helped me to keep it a secret whenever I was staying with my dad, letting her believe I had not come home at all, and that I had to go back to school early over winter break for my work study. This past summer, I told her, via text, that I was staying with my dad. This was a huge step for me; while my 17-year-old brother had been allowed to spend summers with our dad, I was expected to stay at home to watch my other two half brothers (11M and 9M) and feed the pets (Nmom is an animal hoarder). I got my first real job this past summer (which was my excuse for staying at my dad's house), and after we found out she had screwed up my financial aid (after months of bugging her to do it) by not turning it in on time, my second real job just off campus. Through a fluke, I also got back my work study job, as an internship instead. So now I have two jobs, and am taking a full courseload of 15 credits. This has kept me too busy to go home at all this year. 
I saw her twice over the course of the summer, and haven't stayed at her house since last winter break. 
About a week into the new semester she texted me:

""How would u feel about me renting out Ur room for a couple of months?""

I was extremely upset; I broke down crying to my boyfriend. Her ""renting out my room"" would essentially mean that my two younger brothers would be told to throw out everything in my room (she would never do it herself) and I would lose everything there. Also, it just made me realize how little I've been able to see the two younger boys, and that she would soon be disowning me and no longer allow me to see them at all. I love my brothers; I want to be able to see them. I didn't respond immediately, and had to go to class and work not long after. About four hours later, I receive another text from her:

""I am no longer paying Ur phone bill. If u thought u were going to keep ignoring me n not answer text after text u played the wrong game. I am done playing.""

And she cut off my cell service not long after. She's been threatening me with this for years. But she's never gone through with it before, as she knows it's the only thing she has left to hold over my head. She did it this time, cutting off her only reliable way to get in contact with me, as well as cutting the last major thing she has over me other than the two FASFA forms I will need to finish college. 
My dad and step mom helped me get a new phone and number under their plan the very next weekend. I've been careful giving out my new number, and my dad and 17-year-old brother have agreed not to tell her I have a new phone. So, she has no idea that I have it.
Because she thinks she managed to cut me off completely and that I don't have a phone anymore, she messaged me on Facebook yesterday:

""How about we come up n take u n (boyfriend) out for dinner for your birthday on Saturday the 22nd?""

My birthday is in a couple weeks and this is the first contact she's made since she cut off my phone. I haven't opened the message (read it in the notification bar), so she doesn't know I've seen it. I almost never post on Facebook, so it's unlikely she'll know I was on Facebook at all unless Facebook notifies her that I recently liked something. It bugs me that she thinks I've jut completely forgotten about the phone thing and is trying to play the ""good mother"" for my birthday. I just don't know if I should open the message and respond or continue to pretend I never saw it. What should I do? Do I respond? If so, what do I say?

TL;DR: Nmom wanted to rent out my room to a stranger, cut off my cell service, hasn't contacted me since, and now wants to take me out for my birthday as if nothing happened."

Mr. James Goodman, multi-billionaire owner sat in his office behind the dark mahogany desk. The room was massive but empty and cold. Even the sky was a cloudy grey, so the floor to ceiling windows allowed in dull light. Mr. Goodman was not working. That is to say, not doing work for Good Pharmaceuticals, though he considered this work much more important. It was two weeks into the summer intern program and he was looking over all the fresh faces that were hired this summer, not their applications, but through the webcams on their computers. He was looking for ones that showed potential to be brought into an 'accelerated program'.

In the middle of the display was Claudia Busker, a beautiful 20 year old. According to her file she was studying economics, but he didn’t really care about that. But what he cared about was her behavior. She hadn’t been late yet and always finished her tasks ahead of time. She also had a certain fire in her eyes when she worked. She should do just fine James mused. Claudia’s gorgeous Nordic look – blond hair, deep blue eyes – didn’t hurt either.

Mr. G frowned, pressed a button on his desk which resulted in a muffled yelp. “Number 1-0-7-6 was getting sloppy, and not in a good way,” James thought to himself.

Moments later the door to his office opened. His assistant, Miriam, strode in. She had not been an intern, but a toy he had bought himself in Japan a few years back. He was so impressed by her, he even gave her a human name. She wore a tight top threatening to burst and a pencil skirt that hugged her legs down to her knees. Though the skirt restricted her movement, Miriam walked perfectly on the 10 inch stilettos. Each step was precise and the click of shoe on marble echoed through the room. She stopped at his desk, hands behind her back, head looking straight forward.

""I've made my decision. These are the ones I want."" He handed Melissa a small stack of folders. Claudia’s name lined the folder on top. She took the papers, “Yes, Sir. Right away.” Melissa turned around and Mr. Goodman gave her a nice hard slap on the ass as she walked back out. James turned his attentions back to Claudia. He hoped she would be receptive to the training, he’d rather have her sooner than having to wait for her to be broken. He administered two quick shocks to #1076 and he could feel it immediately impaling itself on his cock, deepthroating him.

56aekh,3,2016-10-07,"Finally have the resources for top surgery, but still have some doubts... advice?",unique-eggbeater,ftm,https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/comments/56aekh/finally_have_the_resources_for_top_surgery_but/,"Hi guys, 

SORRY FOR THE WALL OF TEXT. PLEASE feel free to skip to the TL;DR at the bottom, you won't miss that much lol. Also, I know similar posts go around all the time, but I felt the need to talk about my personal take on the topic so I could get personal responses from you guys - it helps a lot to talk directly to people who have been through this stuff, even if I can find similar posts from other people. 

So, this summer I landed a really really good internship, and saved up enough money to get top surgery. I'm looking at Dr. Beverly Fischer right now as she's less than 2 hours away from my location in the states. 

My boyfriend has agreed that he'll help me get to and from the office and help out after surgery. It's unlikely that I'll be able to do it over winter break because I would need to get therapist and GP letters for insurance &amp; I'm currently doing a semester abroad, but spring or summer break might be possible. (Or I might just pay out of pocket and do it over winter break.) Basically, I'm in a pretty good position for getting surgery, all things considered.

I've wanted top surgery somewhere down the line ever since I came out as trans about five years ago. I've had persistent top dysphoria; I've frequently tried to deny/minimize it by doing stuff like not binding for a while, but I've never been able to resolve it to the point where I don't think about it. So a big part of me thinks that top is necessary for me, that there's no way for me to somehow ""get around"" getting it and that delaying it is just that, delaying a medically necessary procedure.

But another big part of me wishes I could somehow come to terms with being a guy with titties. The thing is, they're not causing problems in my life apart from dysphoria. My boyfriend, who is 100% gay, is fine with them and frankly seems to like them much better than I do. They're small enough that even completely pre-T, I would occasionally pass while not binding or even wearing a bra (technically I'm a D cup, but have a very small band size). 

There's stuff that makes me think my chest dysphoria is going to be permanent - if it were purely social dysphoria, I would think some of it might be resolved by the other effects of T, but the top dysphoria affects me deeply when I'm alone as well. According to my bf, when I'm topless I literally treat my chest like it doesn't exist - I don't look at it, touch it, or acknowledge it in any way. Physical sensations on my chest feel almost disembodied. I quite literally barely feel it when I'm touched there, and touches feel strange and incredibly uncomfortable, almost like being touched on your foot when it's fallen asleep. So I think that there really is a part of my body map in my brain that says ""no boobs"", and I guess T isn't likely to change that. But I still am sort of holding out hope that somehow I'll wake up one day and be proud of being a guy with boobs, even though I think rationally that it's unrealistic that that'll happen anytime soon.

I guess I don't want to go through an expensive and scary procedure, especially one that's likely to cause some problems with my parents, if down the line I end up being OK without it. I'm almost 100% certain that if I *do* get it, I won't regret it. But it will make a big difference to my finances over the next few years (getting the procedure would, if out of pocket, wipe out a good amount of my savings), and may affect my ability to move away from my unsupportive parents, which is also a huge impact on my mental health. So it's something I'm weighing very carefully.

Basically, it would be very convenient for me if I could delay surgery for a few years, and in theory I don't see anything wrong with being a guy with boobs, and I wish I could be okay with it and didn't feel so desperate about it. But the fact is that I DO feel desperate about it and deep down inside I feel like I owe it to myself to get top done as soon as possible. 

Anyway, I'm sorry for the huge wall of text, I guess I just wanted to get this out there. Has anyone else struggled with feeling like they *shouldn't* need top surgery, and accepting that they may in fact need it? Conversely, has anyone who thought they needed top surgery ever come to realize that it wasn't the right choice for them? Is there anyone who hated their chest but found a way to view it differently? Is there anyone who felt guilty or wrong about getting top surgery, but came around to the idea and ended up happy with their decision, and if so, how did you resolve your feelings about it?

**TL;DR I finally have the money for top surgery, but although I have persistent physical chest dysphoria, I feel weird about getting a procedure to ""fix"" something that's natural about my body, even though I psychologically need to have them gone. I've felt this way about my chest for years. Is there any chance my feelings will change, or should I accept them and go through with surgery? Did you ever have similar fears or insecurities, and if so how did you resolve them?**"

**432** writers *critiquing each other* for **7 months!**

My name is Brian and I work as an intern for a literary agent. I joined reddit mostly to play Pokémon Go, but after some time I stumbled upon /r/writing - a place for writers. For the last six years I've been writing fiction seriously with the intent to be a published author. And all I've wanted for a long time was a community of writers who could support me and I could support, who could encourage me and who I could encourage, and who were dedicated and could keep me honest. And so I posted an AMA in /r/writing (after I figured out what an AMA was) because giving is a great way to find a community. I work for a literary agent - ask me anything. The response was unlike anything I had expected. In 24 hours I ended up with a massive amount of questions, including a mod who needed verification (because I hadn't even been on reddit for more than a few weeks, so the idea of being verified was totally beyond me). After proving my identity and answering 200 or so questions via direct mail and comments in the AMA thread, and after the mods complimented me on my long-form answers to all the writerly questions, I decided perhaps I should stick around to try to help this community.

So for the last 6 weeks I've been helping - posting a twice-a-week series called Habits &amp; Traits and attempting to help out. But many writers on /r/writing were simply too new to provide the community I was looking for. You see, in writing, this type of thing happens a lot. Writers go to public forums to get advice and feedback. They meet a few people they like and notice the valuable critique on their work. And then they start communicating only with those few, leaving the public forum behind. As they get published works, they stick to their tiny circles and lurk, often watching and chuckling at those fumbling in the dark. They generally don't go back to the big groups full of needy writers to help or encourage, because they have their tiny solitary circle community and they get greedy about who knows what -- because knowledge is power. I can't tell you how much I disagree with that mentality, or how much I wish more published authors would take a genuine interest in mentorship in the public groups. One of the few published authors I know who actually does try to help the community is Diana Gabaldon (known for the Outlander series) and for her I will always have nothing but the utmost respect. To my knowledge, I cannot find a single instance of another major published author who attempts to build this type of community in an open forum. All I could find was a giant vacuum of struggling authors trying desperately to weave their way through the dark while the experienced only pop in for a moment to plug their books and flee.

And that's when I found /r/writerchat. They were new. They were small. They had an IRC for quite a while and decided to move to reddit. They didn't have a power-trip mentality. They were friendly. At first, I joined their IRC under a pseudo to see how they treated new people. They welcomed me with open arms. They were kind and supportive. I told them about a made up and intentionally terrible-sounding project, and they still tried to help. I was annoying and they were patient. I was all the things that most writers scoff at, and they didn't scoff. And that, right there, is why I want to nominate this place. I joined with them, partnering with the mods to help direct writers to the IRC and the forum. I offered whatever assistance I could, answering live publishing questions in the IRC and on the forum. Back in /r/writing young writers continued to post questions and get flamed for asking them. Other writers decided to criticize the quality of all the writing on /r/writing, and though it wasn't meant to personally harm me, it enraged me because the post attempted to undo all that I was trying to do (build up new writers, not criticize and tear them down). And so I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/writerchat/comments/50ihsw/discussion_this_place_is_the_cure/?), and meant every word of it -


I wanted to nominate /r/writerchat because I believe in them. I believe that they can be an open community with valuable content that is accessible to writers of every level -- something I have wanted for a long time, perhaps even something I had given up trying to find. I know I'm not the only writer who feels this way. I know there are a lot of writers out there who are struggling to find a place where they too will be encouraged, supported, respectfully critiqued and challenged, where they can grow in their craft, a place to call home. I know because it took me a long time to find anything even resembling community. And now that I've found it, I want to point others there too.

I hope you'll consider /r/writerchat. I hope you will take a look around their forum at the time they spent creating their tools and bots to help encourage writers. Writerchat is the bunker that writers can go to when they feel like they are the worst writer in the world. It's a place that lifts writers up and encourages them. It's a safe haven for writers of all levels. It doesn't try to speak out against the lack of community -- instead it's trying to be the solution.

&gt;##1. What is the purpose of your subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**dogsongs:** /r/writerchat is a community for writers and readers to discuss anything with like-minded people. While writing and all its parts come up - planning, editing, publishing - we aren’t limited to it. Sometimes we stray. Above everything we’re a group of friends. We like that.

&gt;&gt;The sub started as a hub for [our IRC (our real-time chat channel)](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.snoonet.org/writerchat), and a lot of the activity remains there. In the IRC, we have trivia night every Friday, Word War Weekends, and voice chat nights. There’s also a lot of talking about nothing. It’s great.

&gt;&gt;We also hold contests with a new theme/challenge every month, and critique partner sign-ups for when you want some as-you-write feedback.

&gt;##2. How does the credit system work and what are your reasons for including it?

&gt;&gt;**dogsongs:** The credit system was implemented as a measure to make sure that no one takes too much without giving something back.

&gt;&gt;In its current iteration, someone - the OP - posts a piece of writing for critique (which takes up 10 credit, or if it’s their first time, it’s free), and then people respond with feedback. Based on the quality of each person’s feedback, the OP can give up to 5 credit as a reward. Mods can also give credit for good content or discussion posts.

&gt;&gt;Ideally, the system turns cyclical and the community starts feeding itself with more posts, discussions, content, and feedback, all in the name of receiving credit so that each member of the community can continue to receive critique on their own work while giving back to the community itself.

&gt;##3. One of the most alluring aspects of your sub is that it's a tightly-knit group of people. Do you see any danger of this changing after your sub is featured?

&gt;&gt;**dogsongs:** Definitely not. We are very friendly and open to newcomers and are ready to welcome them to the community. WriterChat was created by a close group of friends, but it's the community that keeps it going and helped shape what it has become. The more people we have, the better. Everyone gets along and there’s some really productive conversations. There’s also some deeply unproductive conversations, and we love those too.

&gt;&gt;Our core is in the real-time chat, the IRC. The sub was born from the chat first and foremost.  New people may come or go but the regulars stick around to talk shop, vent, or indulge in some entertainment.

&gt;##4. Which mod is the absolute worst with narrative tropes?

&gt;&gt;**dogsongs:** Are we allowed to say mods of our IRC? /u/SushiGoldberg plots with a bottle of Pinot and hardly writes. She is a walking trope... Does that count?

&gt;##5. Have you written anything you'd like to present to the greater reddit community?

&gt;&gt;**dogsongs:** The difference we have noticed about our community vs others is the amount of writers we have who are continually producing and releasing writing. Looking at our combined user wordcount over projects recorded on our IRC, we have over 3,000,000 words and counted written in our community.

&gt;&gt;If anyone is interested, they can view the list of community projects here: http://dogsong.net/projects.php

&gt;##6. Anything else you care to share?

&gt;&gt;**dogsongs:** Although it’s not the most popular aspect of the sub, we do have a critique partner feature. The critique partner feature was implemented so that people could work 1-on-1 for the month with someone else from the community. This is intended for longer pieces that go past the wordcount limit we have imposed on regular posts submitted for critique, such as in progress novels that someone may need help with. Critique partner posts are made at the beginning of each month, and at the end of the month a post is made to allow people to give credit to their critique partners for their help.

&gt;&gt;For those who would like to join the IRC, we would like to mention that we are very proud of our chatbot, Ampersand. Every weekend, Ampersand holds automated Word War Weekends, which are events in which writers compete with each other to write the most in a set amount of time. He’s also pretty sassy.

I am a junior accounting student with a 3.7 GPA, member and officer in my BAP chapter, currently interning at a private firm and going through the recruitment process to try to score an internship for the spring semester.  As the title suggests, I have been rejected by 3 of the 5 firms I have interviewed with so far - 2 of the rejections were from small firms with 1 being from a mid tier firm. The other 2 are 1 small firm and another mid-tier firm.

I feel that I have done the best I can during the process. Through BAP and other campus events, I have always made sure to network and let my name be known to those prospective firms. I applied to these positions through my university, did well in the on campus interviews, and made the call-back interviews when applicable. At those call-backs, I feel that I really bonded with the employees and staff and made great conversations and connections. I did great at up-talking my current internship experience and my BAP officer experiences. I even made sure to follow up the day after each interview to thank the interviewer.

To blatantly put it, I am freaking out and really need advice. With the amount of effort I put into this process and my background, I feel that I should be receiving more offers than I am (I really do not mean that to sound cocky, but I just want to have a better understanding of why I'm receiving so many rejections before it is too late). But obviously, my efforts have not been enough, which is why I need to come to /r/accounting for advice. 

Thus, I have the following questions:

Should I respond back to my rejections, thanking them for their consideration and ask them for advice about how to do better next time?

I currently have a misdemeanor on my record for marijuana possession that will be cleared early next year (have to wait a year after court date). Is this what is standing in my way of getting an awesome internship?

In general, what is something more that I can do to make sure to be a better and attractive candidate for these positions?

I really do need these answered, but to be frank, in my head I'm screaming ""WHAT DO I DO??"" Thus, I appreciate all of the advice that any of you can give. I will keep you all posted on if I receive offers or rejections from the remaining firms.

Thanks in advance and I wish you all the best today.

Edit: I apologize for typo in title. So far, the two remaining firms still have not reached back out with a rejection or offer."

56edgl,10,2016-10-07,"I'm [21 F] moving out, but I feel bad for taking all of my stuff from my roommates [20s M &amp; F]",kkdb5568,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/56edgl/im_21_f_moving_out_but_i_feel_bad_for_taking_all/,"So, I recently found out that I was accepted for my dream internship, and it starts in a couple months (Yay!)

The only problem is, this means I'm going to have to move out of my house that I've been sharing with three roommates. They're close friends of mine, and I've loved living with them. 

Unfortunately, most of the stuff in the house is mine. The TV, the TV stand, the microwave, coffee maker, electric tea kettle, every lamp, table and chair. You name it. 

I feel terrible, because I'm the one who told them not to buy anything because I had lived alone before and already had it all. Now, I'm worried about how they're going to afford to replace everything if I take it all with me. They aren't very well off,  so I have a feeling they'll just go without.

Since I'm going to be living a few hours away with my sister at her house, I was contemplating leaving some of the stuff behind on the condition that I get it back after the semester is over. For example, I won't need an extra microwave at her house, so I would just be taking it and putting it in storage somewhere. Wouldn't it be better to leave it for my roommates to use?

The only problem with that idea is, I won't be there, so I won't know how my stuff is being used. What if they accidentally break something and don't want to pay for it? I consider them close friends, but I'm still kind of hesitant to basically loan out my stuff to them. People always say to never loan money to friends and family, only give them money if you don't want it back. This might not be money, but it would still be a loan. 

On the other hand, I'd feel like a piece of shit if I practically cleaned out the whole house and left them with nothing but a couch and a rug halfway through the year. 

My question is, how should I go about this?

TL;DR I'm moving out but feel bad about taking all my stuff and leaving my roommates with nothing. "
56g73b,2,2016-10-08,[EVENT] The Quest to Build a Fully-Functional Aircraft in Mexico,_Carloss_,GlobalPowers,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalPowers/comments/56g73b/event_the_quest_to_build_a_fullyfunctional/,"*""The assembly of a fully-functional aircraft in Mexico is only a matter of time. with growth rates averaging 17.5% a year and exports growing at an average of 15% the industry is expected to account for $12 billion worth of exports exluding the defense,  civil and corproate aviation markets. Brazilian firms managed to produce full aircraft in 20 yearas and Mexico must achieve this in a shorter timespan: for it is a matter of national pride and international notoriety, especially for a developing country such as Mexico""* - **MEXICONOW**

----------------------
In ten years time Mexico's aviation industry has grown from basic harness assembly to the assembly of full structural aircraft components, composite aiframes and micro-tolerance parts. The industry now employs 55 thousand people and it is estimated that by 2020 this number will reach somewhere between 75 to 105 thousand people. The aerospace boom has greatly contributed to the number of engineering students which now stands at 50 thousand graduates anually and - thanks to industry partnerships with education institutions - very advanced education schemes conbiming internships, pre-hiring, vocational training and other components have gained fertile ground in Mexico. 

But Mexico's aviation potential has not been fully exploited. Whilst complete ""skeletons"" and subsystems are presently being manufactured in Mexico for a tenth the cost of labour in the US no ""full"" aircraft are being manufactured in Mexico. The main reason this has not occured is because of issues rpetaining to FAA approval of aicraft and regulatory concerns. 

Presently there are four firms operating in Mexico which effectively manufacture the entire aircraft in Mexican facilities:

* Bombardier manufactures it's [Learjet 85](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learjet_85) in Querétaro.

* Cessna manufactures it's [TTX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cessna_400) in Chihuahua.

* Brechcraft's  [Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beechcraft_Baron) and [Bonanza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beechcraft_Bonanza) are also manufactured in Chihuahua.

* Textron de México manufactures several Bell helicopters in Chihuahua.

In the case of Bombardier's Learjet 85 operations the key issue is ""certification"". Despite practically the entire aircraft and subsystems being manufactured in Mexico without an FAA Airworthiness Certification an aircraft may not fly at all. And despite the Bilateral Aviation Safety Agreement (BASA) establishing reciprocal certifications for aviation products the process is still in it's infancy stage. A lack of adequate human and administrative resoruces also prevent Mexico's aviation industry from reaching higher in this subject. Trust is also an issue: each customer has it's own requirements for avionics, engines and finishes and it - like the automotive industry in Mexico - would presumably take manny years for customers to fully trust wholly-Mexican manufactured aircraft.

Textron de México's helicopter manufacturing operations are perhaps more promising. The helicopter cabins are 20% short of being fully-fuctional rotorcraft lacking only the avionics and rotor assembly. Helicopters are build for inventory and thus the market might be less resistant to wholly-Mexican airframes. 

But despite the hurdles foriegn aviation companies have faith in Mexico as has been shown by Bombardier when it chose Querétaro for it's Learjet 85 assembly operations in 2006, and the pressence of a long runway nearby serves as a subtle hint that Bombardier may have desires to move the full assembly process to Mexico should the circumstances improve. Mexican small and mid-sized companies are specialized in carrying out specialized tasks. Assembling fully-functional aircraft has the potential to create major indirect economic growth through improved supply chains and more companies moving closer to the assembly facilities. Perhaps it is only a matter of time before Mexicó's aviation industry trully shows it's potential to the world.

-----------------------
In an effort to adress the issue of certification, human and administrative resources the Mexican Goverment has decided to reform the Directorate General of Civil Aciation (*Dirección General de Aeronáutica Civil*). The organization will be renamed the Mexican Federal Aviation Authority (*Autoridad Federal de Aviación de México* - *AFAM*). The AFAM will be subject to an increased budget to hire more presonnel and adress other issues. Furthermore the AFAM will over the next two years revamp it's regulatory framework to align with FAA and EASA regulations and standards. Negotiations with both above-mentioend aviation authorities will be held in order to allow American and European companies to  manifacture ""full"" aircraft in Mexico.

The National Centre for Aviation Education and Vocational Training (*Centro Nacional de Educación y Formación Profesional de Aviación* - *CNFPA*) will be an autonomous organ subordinate to the AFAM. It will work with the private sector and educational institutions to implement the succesful education schemes conceived by partnerships between the aviation industry and education institutions and will strive to implement them on a natonwide level to create higher standards of education and employment in the aviation industry.

Hey guys, 

I'm a 23 y/o Dutch guy, I’m a student (bachelor), am pretty lazy, got some social anxieties and love to play games. I have a depression. I take meds since February and currently I’m in a ""healing"" process. So, I’m going to spare you all the self-pity stuff and how I turned into an average person to a depressed one and start right at the beginning of my first breakdowns. 

**First breakdowns** *March 2014*

So the first time i got emotionally destroyed was when my dad told me ""If you want to live like this it's better to just go to the hospital and get a shot"".
I was lazy, my grades were shit, I reduced my social circle, had no side-job or anything at all. I played soccer and that was about it. So I needed to get an internship, failed to get one and my parents were really disappointed seeing how i lived my life. At that moment they didn't realize how hard it was on me already. Why he said something cruel like that? Emotions, work/stress related home situation and his negative personality. Never got over this to be honest. 

**Rejections** *September - December 2014*

So after 6 months or so I started looking for an internship again, got invited to almost all companies I send an application too, got rejected at every interview.. for an INTERNSHIP. I'm not even good enough to learn the practical side of an occupation, I collapsed again.
My mom talked me into getting more help from my University. Eventually a teacher of mine recommended a great place where I could learn and my internship with them was great! However, what changed? well I was happier for a bit, the problems were procrastinated. But I didn’t tackle my problems, my personality. And every day I started to dislike myself more to the point where i hated myself more and more and my wish for miraculously being killed changed to having suicidal thought. Did I have a plan? No, not a date. But enough ways, I knew where we kept the round-up (strong poison), had a car for necessary means. What really set me off to have these thoughts? The continues struggle with myself, wore me out. Seeing my select friends and environment moving on, while i was still the same pathetic kid as 4 years back. The feeling never made someone love me. Always being reminded of bad things from the past, some everyday not nice thought could enter my brain any time and I could only scream it out. But I couldn’t scream cause i didn’t want too. It wore me down mentally a lot, sometimes I feel like my depression had a negative impact on my brain capacity.
*I had my internship from February till July 2015*

**PART 2**

**My mask, my savior?** *December 2015*

Fortunately my mask, which I wore for years, begin to wear cause even that mask couldn't hide my true face. My parents got really worried and my mom talked me into seeing a professional. I did. He was concerned and send me to a so called ""crisis team"". I didn’t had to wait to start my therapy, luckily.

**My therapy** *Februarys till now 2016*

My cognitive behavior therapy started, but still lazy AF it's hard to actually focus on this therapy on a frequent base. I also got meds, 10 mg Paroxetine to start with (got 30 mg now and its sufficient). I was lucky not to have a lot of side effects in the beginning (I had a lot of problems upgrading from 20 to 30 though). So the therapy and meds helped me to change myself a bit, too start shaping old me into something better. I started working out, fitness, trying to see my friends far more and I got an organization where I could do my Thesis. The change in mere weeks were huge, far, far too huge. It went well but I couldn't handle it all. 
But first let me take you to *the importance of fitness*; so I weighed about 55 kilo being 1.80 m tall. I was a plank yes, 5 % fat. Now I weigh 66 kilo, 8-9 % fat and can push 45 kilo easily on the bench and can push 50 as well (so nearly my own weight). So I started fitness with a friend, at first it was just fun to do. Being in a **SAFE** environment. Going to a safe environment is really important here, go somewhere you feel comfortable. People were nice, we got a training schedule and it went good. My friend was active in searching new trainings to do and i got a bit into searching how to optimize your training. Soon we had our own schedules. Fitness made me feel better about my own body, the anxiety of being bullied as a plank there were unrealistic and the effort i put in it payed. I could see my improvement, it became part of my mental therapy and still is.

**PART 3**
**My study / thesis** *February till now 2016*

So the Thesis I’m working on, you can imagine that going not too well every time. The change in my life was too HUGE to make everything work right away. In the end life comes with ups and downs, a curve. So sooner and later I did inappropriate but innocent things at my workplace. I couldn’t hide my depression from my boss and my work, so I had to tell a few off them. My boss and his wife are one of the most amazing people I have ever met. He accepts that I’m in a journey and helps me. So over the course of my time there (i still am busy with it) my thesis / project got delayed and I ran into some problems every now and then.
But things cannot go great always. At one point it all **collapsed** again, the thesis kind of sucked, i failed a really important test for my bachelor and a girl in Scotland -*to whom I confessed, we made plans to meet each other at her city*- told me she changed her mind. I still went to Scotland and met her, but it was all one big disappointment. There's far more too that story, but it's too much to write down now and I'm very embarrassed by the story itself.
So ye I collapsed here again and realized i should take it easy, realized my brain is **not functioning optimal** and that my journey will crash if I take the wrong road. So I took a long vacation to get some well-deserved rest (It feels that way). ATM I’m doing good, I’m learning to schedule and control my life better.

**PART 3.B**

**Other people who helped me.**

**N** *April 2016 till now*

Apart from my counselor, parents and boss there were some ppl who helped me. The first one I want to mention is Nexus and his girlfriend.
He gave me courage and helped me trust myself to interact with girls. *Cause there IS NOTHING wrong with me*. I met him via dota 2 btw, I have MAJOR respect for him and his way of life.

**Parc 3.C**

*Please go to the comments as i have some problems with heavy scripting and texts.*

**PART 4** 

**My current situation**

I'm actually really frustrated by the actions I have to take to get to these points and the next steps. Why? cause I don’t want to take them? No. But because the effort I put in things is incredibly high and the reward is often just not noticeable or even terrible. **questions like**: *""Why can't I just be happy""* or *""Why does it have to be this way""* and *""What will go wrong next""* are only a few of the daily struggles I may or may not encounter. For **example**: So I’ve been flirting with a girl a bit lately and yesterday I asked her out in a really spontaneous and cute way, she loved it as well. So we'll be having a drink or w/e sometime soon but, here are some things my mind **WILL** go too, that makes me **DOUBT**: After nearly 4-5 years of depression (without handling it), a lot of rejections in almost every aspect of life, one can understand that my confidence and experience with girls is below zero. IT doesn’t help that this girl is quite younger than me. So I can't help but think that it probably end in a disaster. I hope I’ll be able to talk to this girl IRL as I can on chat. I hope I won't be a *disappointment* to her. And even IF she **likes** me, what should I do then? I really, really don't know. I have this insane idea to get an escort. I actually called one last Wednesday and wanted to make a ""date"" with her for like next Saturday or something. She was like ""*Dude, wtf man. call on the day you want something, Jesus.""* She sounded very agitated from the beginning. But that idea is still in my mind.

So far my story, obviously there are a lot of aspects I didn’t told you guys. The girl in Scotland. How I didn’t deal with all the rejections from internships, other psychological trauma like events, no matter how small they can shape a person if you make it big enough. Anything Pre 2014 i did not cover

For some I hope my story inspires them to make a move. For others it may be a realization / example of where first world people can struggle with. But mostly I hope that you'll realize and see how a depressed person need some people whom he/she can use to better him/herself.

America loss the chance to have this moral superiority complex and outrage when it comes to the sanctity of the White House when a sitting President had sex with an intern in the White House, lied on TV to the American people, lied to the Grand Jury, and still continued to finish his term as President. Then was lauded as still being a great President after the fact. We accepted this as a standard that would not disqualify someone to be President. We've set a moral and behavioral precedent that the sexual behavior of a President is not an important standard to the office. 

If we can bring up Melania Trump's magazine spread and sex history, then we have to bring up Bill Clinton's...and by that Bill Clinton shouldn't able to be First Man either... if you're going to be a defender of women, then you have to defend the totality of this issue on both sides. 

We have already shown America will give a pass to sexual deviancy when it comes to the highest position in this country... The position of President has already been tainted by that...and you can't put that cat back in the box...

Can't have it both ways folks...if you're going to hound someone for the things they said...then you have to hound the other one for the things they actually did. 

I'm not condoning anyone's actions or words, but it's pretty hypocritical the conversation around this issue."
56h76o,63,2016-10-08,"[Spoilers, Theory] On the topic of Afton (a VERY expansive theory on everything Sister Location related.)",trollol333,fivenightsatfreddys,https://www.reddit.com/r/fivenightsatfreddys/comments/56h76o/spoilers_theory_on_the_topic_of_afton_a_very/,"Despite what everybody is saying, that we don't play as Afton, I just had the simplest realization today that blows the theory over. Ready?

Afton Robotics and Circus Baby's Pizza World's owners are two different companies. Afton robotics is only a company that makes the animatronics and delivers them to whoever paid for them.

**What does this mean?**

Baby can very easily not recognize Afton. He just created her and delivered her to CBPW, where she was first activated. Baby doesn't recognize Afton because she just isn't able to. She's never seen him.

**What about the daughter and her voice lines?**

Afton's daughter says he built Baby for her. Why is this if he doesn't own the restaurant? Simple. He just wanted to make the kid happy, so he made Baby in the exact way she wanted him to. Imagine if you were a little kid and your dad was able to create robots. What would you want one to do? Make ice cream, blow balloons, sing songs... 

**Why doesn't he want her to approach Baby?**

Stay with me here...

What I believe to be the order of events is:

1) Dead child in vent found, possibly an Afton murder victim.

2) Afton builds Circus Baby with the Scooper or another murder tool installed within her. (Why he didn't want his Daughter to approach her.)

**Furthermore,**

3) Spirit of the vent child possesses Circus Baby (could also be used as proof for why Baby doesn't recognize Afton). It's impossible for Baby to not be possessed, since she's sentient, self aware, and aware of surroundings. Something that HandyUnit cannot do.

4) Baby uses the murder tool unwillingly after her systems and systems overtake her, Afton daughter dies, and the spirit creates a body for itself, Ennard.

5) Afton takes the night shift in CBPW.

6) Afton meets his daughter and they come back home to live a ""normal"" familly life.

**OR**

6) Baby, Afton's murder victim, gets revenge on Afton, and mauls his bones out to replace them with ennard. Note that she doesn't know she got vengance since she didn't recognize Afton when he first walked in. 

The funny thing here is in both 6) Afton reconnects with his daughter, but in very, VERY different ways.

**In that case, why does Afton still kill children even after his daughter (Ennard) took control of him?**

Why do the children in FNaF 1 want to kill the guard? It's just a quirk of the FNaF universe, every lost soul is filled with unbound amounts of anger and violence. It's possible that after Fake Ending, the daughter finally realizes the man she's been trying to kill is her father. After all, the room before the Scooper Room was pitch black, and the Fake Ending office wasn't that easy to see in either.

**What about HandyUnit? Why does he lecture Afton if he's the one that made the instructions in the first place?**

As I stated before, HandyUnit is NOT sentient. It's all prerecorded. That's why he doesn't notice Baby, Ballora, and Funtime Foxy being off stage half the time.

**Okay, so... What does this mean for Afton?**

This could actually explain quite a bit about Afton. As far as I'm aware, Pink Guy only appears in GoGoGo and TakeCakeToTheChildren. He has black eyes then. Every other time we meet him he's got white pupils and he's slightly bulkier. This would be the Ennard metal instead of bones.

**Why doesn't Afton attack anybody during his normal work shifts?**

The thing Baby and Ennard have both figured out is playing pretend. Because, after all, FNaF is all about playing pretend. Just like Ennard pretended to be the CBPW's cast. 

And Afton is still alive when Ennard takes over. Unfortunately, we don't have all the info on how Scooping works with a person, so we just have to assume Afton's brain still carries over to the ""new"" body, hence why he's still able to work as a handyman.

**What time does SL take place in?**

I believe SL takes place between 1983-1987. I still think 1983 was just the date that FFD was BUILT and the bite (and consequently FNaF 4) is in 1987. Also, as others have said, it's possible CBPW is just part of Fazbear Entertainment's ownership, and it's just a lower part of Fredbear's Familly Diner. Not only that, Afton seems to have an obsession about FE, only murders there, only works there... So this would keep up that theme.

Fake Ending also shows us that FNaF 4 is still related to 1983, and even shows us the Fredbear plush, but since the plush isn't haunted here, I'm just gonna assume it got possessed AFTER 1983 for further counter proof against Bite of 83. Even then, it's possible to brush Fake Ending as being non-canon and everything related to it being non canon, so... either way, sorry 83. No confirmation for you today.

**Gas Leak location?**

Baby mentions how they used Springlock suits in her previous location, which probably was the gas leak one. Not to mention this also makes Afton's obsession with FE seem even stronger, since he worked for both FFP, FFD, and CBPW. 

I also think the Gas Leak location went on to become FF, because a Gas Leak would easily explain why the place burned down. It also makes Afton's demise in FF all the more satisfying, since he died in the exact same spot where he once worked internship for FE.

Also, Fake Ending's office seems to suggest that FFD (the place that SL was build under) was later built into FFP from FNaF 1, so they just reused the doors and the fan and... everything else really.

**Phew!**

That sure was a long read. I hope you enjoyed. Let me know what you think."

Why does Bill Clinton matter here? He is not running for president, and this video is not about him.

Also: http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/29/politics/donald-trump-bill-clinton-lewinsky/

This article ^ contains like no reasoning for why Trump is bringing up Bill again.

A quote from Trump's twitter: ""Hillary Clinton has announced that she is letting her husband out to campaign but HE'S DEMONSTRATED A PENCHANT FOR SEXISM, so inappropriate!""

Honestly, what does sexism have to do with campaigning? And what does having several affairs with interns have to do with sexism?

Keep in mind that there are numerous mentions of Bill Clinton's scandals I see on this sub and /r/The_Donald every day.

Why do they matter? It's Hillary's race, not Bill's. Isn't there enough dirt on Clinton for Trump to just focus on her scandals?"
56icfq,6,2016-10-08,How to handle a Tech career as an Alpha Male.,joefiggins,asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/56icfq/how_to_handle_a_tech_career_as_an_alpha_male/,"So I'm in a computer science program right now and I'm trying to network with people, get internships, and attend career-development events like hackathons.

It has become apparent to me that this field is being dominated by feminine male geek personalities. The top players are men who will dedicate 90% of their waking lives to mastering technology for the sake of only gaining social credit in a feminine greek culture.

There is a noticeable lack of testosterone and sexual energy. I feel like I am surrounded by a bunch of androgynous man-children, whose brains have grown to a great size, yet whose testicles remain underdeveloped.

If you doubt any of what I'm saying then you must experience it for yourself before you comment.

This low-testosterone, sexless, male geek culture has taken over the field and dominates the industry from the top down: Facebook, Google, Amazon, etc. They are staffed and managed by people just like this. They shape their corporate culture to accommodate these kinds of people: there are friggin slides and adult playgrounds in their offices for these man-children to play on.

My potential colleagues around me have almost 0 value to me outside of knowing how to code and hack things.

Perhaps 1/100 of the people I meet seem like normal men with healthy testosterone levels and well-rounded passions and interests. But of course these men, like me, are pushed to the margins. We're smart and interested in the topics, but we don't fit in.

And since this culture dominates the field. I will face an extremely extremely hard uphill battle both getting jobs, working with colleagues, and advancing. 

It seems futile and self-destructive to try to succeed in this environment. (1) If you are beta in the field, your ""alpha"" leaders are really omega males who are only known for their tech skills. (2) If you try to be alpha, you wind up being omega because not a single one of these feminine men will be interested in following someone who displays masculinity and courage or interests outside of coding, video games, and whatever other things real men would never be caught doing.

I'm not so sure what to make of the situation anymore. It seems like either of two things will happen to me: I will either have to become a dull beta following an omega in a feminine geek culture in order to hold down good jobs. Or I will be naturally forced out of the field by the fact that my testosterone and red pill worldview doesn't allow me to fit in or lead anyone.

Frankly I am so resolute in my masculinity that I would rather be forced into poverty than spend the rest of my life as a neutered tech bro making 200k but never feeling like a man. There are homeless men who are more masculine and get more pussy than these pathetic creatures will ever be regardless of how much money they make or their social rank in the geek culture."

I am 26 years old, and I have PMO'd for years now. My obsession with it began very young, and I wish to understand how it came about. I can remember as young as 8 or 9 years old, I used to have pervy thoughts about actresses. They were not about sex because I didn't even know what that was at that point, it was just thoughts about naked ladies.

I grew up in a home where the father is mentally abusive to the mom, and I grew up hearing him shout a lot. Unfortunately my mother is timid and could never stand up to him. I remember as young as 4 (or so my mother has told me), I used to try come to my mom's aid. 

I have had a weird fetish for spanking porn, since the age of 14. It could be because I'm an ass guy, but I suspect it could have something to do the circumstances I grew up in. I only very recently came over that fetish, and haven't had a thought about it in weeks.

Watching porn began when I was 12, and I discovered masturbation at 14. From the age of 15 to 19, I probably masturbated once a day at least.

Moved abroad for college, and my freshman year I had such a good first semester in dorms (4 months) that I actually remember going days without PMO. Second semester however, with the stress of classes, I got back into it.

2nd year of college and I moved into an appt. Got back heavily into PMO now that I had a room of my own. I remember my internship at the end of 3rd year, I had 3 months with not much to do. Every day after work, without fail, I'd have tabs of porn open and masturbate at least once.

Graduated and started working at 23, and the habit continued. I remember there were times when I'd masturbate twice in succession lying in bed before going to sleep.

I finally put my foot down at 24 (2014) and decided to promise myself 'no porn weeks'. I'd still masturbate, but not watch porn for the period of a week. At the end of the week, I'll watch a lot of it for a couple days, then make the promise again.

Got my first girlfriend at 25, and had a relationship for 3 months. We had a really good time, I had my urges of course but I was never pushy. She never called me thirsty or desperate or anything, in fact now that I think of it, I'm surprised at myself that after so many years of abstinence and desperation, I could hold myself back. We got a room on our 4th date and I completely failed when we tried to have sex. She was hot AF, in fact she was just my preferred body type, yet I could barely hold an erection for more than 10 seconds. 
She was very supportive and told me it happens (she was more experienced than me).

Tried giving me a handjob a few weeks later, and in 10 seconds the poor girl's hand had cum in it. Again she was very supportive and laughed it off.

During the relationship, I was a lot happier with myself. I was no longer checking out every decent looking girl on the street.

We broke up exactly a year ago, and my habit continued. In fact, I was masturbating (not watching porn) even when dating her.

A few months after the breakup, I was lonely and missed her. I noticed that I was returning to looking at girls on the streets and everywhere with a pervert eye, something I hate.

A couple weeks ago, I decided that I'd had enough, and came here. I'd heard of nofap, but never been. It struck me how united and motivating everyone here is. I have not watched porn since, but have checked out gonewild and fapped 3 times since. 


I feel that after 12-13 years of fapping and even longer of porn, to come to an immediate stop is not possible for me and will only make my urges worse. I can bring my masturbating down to once a week, which I have done for the past 3 weeks. Should I begin from there?

And I want to ask you guys, what is the purpose behind nofap? Is it not ok to appreciate the beauty of the female body (while trying to not objectify it). So then, is it wrong to look at images and have naughty thoughts?

I had a successful relationship. I don't feel my PMO habits had a negative effect on it, and apart from the fail at sex, we had a great time. (and I didn't tell her about my PMO problems, because at that point I hadn't convinced myself that it was a problem). So then, is it not ok to masturbate less frequently as a medium to let out sexual frustration and as a stress buster too?

Because if abstinence is the purpose, then I don't feel I can ever get there. I can force myself to not watch porn, even images. But I can't force myself to not think about women. Isn't that part of being a man? and viceversa, even for a woman, is it wrong if she fantasizes about hot men? Or am I missing the purpose here.

How I treated my employees. My wife. The women I fucked on the side.

Were it not for my mood swings and, for lack of a better word, bossiness, your internship was perfectly uneventful. And, really, my boorishness was never truly directed at you. In fact, nothing was really directed at you. Aside from the few menial tasks I sent your way, I generally ignored you.

Sometime near the end of your internship, something changed. You don't know exactly what made you say it--maybe it was the argument you had with your boyfriend that morning. Maybe you had just had enough of seeing me swagger around, day in and day out.

""Grab me a coffee,"" I said, not even looking you in the eye. ""Oh, get it yourself,"" you said. ""And get me me one while you're at it,"" you said under your breath as I walked away.

You didn't know what to expect. You spent the next ten minutes chewing me out in your head, saying everything you've been thinking these past few months. Whatever you could have expected, it wasn't this: the cup of coffee I set gently on your desk.

Things were noticeable different from that moment on. Each day, there would be a cup of coffee waiting for you at your station. Your ideas were taken seriously. If you dropped a pen, I was on my knees ready to pick it up for you before it hit the ground. It was pretty obvious you had me wrapped around your finger.

So that's the set up. Let's see how far you can take me. Orgasm denial, forced bisexuality, whatever you can come up with. Make me write your name on my cock and have me fuck my wife. Own me.

While roleplay can be fun, I want you to mostly play you, and I will mostly play me. And I really want to do the things you ask me to do (go ahead, demand proof). I guess what I'm trying to say is, if you are a younger woman who has always wanted to completely boss an older guy around, now's your chance.

Most of the old/famous/tenured professors:
""you need to be deeply interested in your field to shine, and if things don't work out you can always change fields after you have proven yourself""

PhD students offer something very different pieces of advice:
""the key of success is your advisor network, reputation, and interest in you""

My view is that both groups are biased in their own way
the first one is the advice of the winners who made it
the second one is the advice of the ones who are not there yet

Up to now I've been keeping a generic approach studying machine learning and robotics while doing plenty of work on non invasive BCI but in the next months i'll have to choose a lab where to do my internship so it's time to choose.

I have a standing offer for a Marr prize level computer vision (ML) lab
and research internship in a state of the art spinoff working on BCI

should i go for the safe machine learning route and keep neuroscience as my
""hobby"" or go for neuroscience and be a machine learning guy

I like ML a lot, and think it'll have a profound impact on the future but i regard linking mind and machines as an even higher goal."

(2Months)",Needsumhelp91,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/56jpwg/i_25m_havent_had_a_proper_date_in_a_long_time_now/,"**Long version:**
A friend of mine introduces this girl to me, because she thinks we are a good match. She shows me pics of her, and she is very pretty, started to think maybe too pretty. This girl is still living with her parents and siblings downtown, done with college and doing internship, and she is apparently looking for a serious relationship to ""settle down"", you know move out, start a family, save up money for that dream house and dog yadi yada yada. And I'm not really looking for one night stands either, I wouldn't mind something serious after this age and my position.

Fast-forward a bit, it turns out we really do have a lot in common. Similar interests, food, music, share the same values and happens we both want to visit same countries and what not. We've talked a lot and I went from not being interested, to almost nervous about meeting her. I'm usually not that nervous until the last moment before something. But overall a pretty chill guy, some say too chill but I dunno about that.

Oh yes, me? I'm an engineer student on my last year and I happen to study outside town, can only visit town every weekend, and this girl barely has time from her internship. But we will both make room for next weekend and meet up. 

As said I'm still studying, and I have studied nonstop after highschool(went straight into college and tried out several programs, wasted some years in school yes). 


Some ask why I don't get into relationships, I like to think it's because I'm occupied with my studies, haters will say I'm being passive and would need that affection. But in all honesty, I've never really bothered and have usually waited for someone to approach me, and honestly I'm quite stupid sometimes and don't understand when someone is being friendly vs romantic. People have had to tell me several times that some chick was totally in to me and I missed a shot. Seems like all the years without being romantically involved has made me somewhat ""ignorant"" about relationships and body language, if that makes sense. (I don't know, my phrasing isn't quite right, I'm sorry for this wall of incoherent text.)

Moreover, our current state is, we are actively talking couple times of the week. I haven't mentioned to her that my friend told me she was looking for a relationship. It just felt awkward, but I think we both know actually what's up. But no one mentions it. Our first conversation, as I recall It was something like:

- ""Hi, my friend X told me you wanted to meet/talk""  

- ""talk? she actually said so?""

- ""I mean.. yes?.. or no.. Wait where did you even see me, I don't even know you. What did you guys really talk about""

- ""Well let that be a secret for now;) What's up?:)""

It was quite awkward, didn't know what to say. ""X told me you wanted to hook up"" just felt, not so serious? I was trying to sound like a nice guy and not a douche about it. Don't want to make her feel uncomfortable either by going, ""oh so you really like what you see eh, lets go!"" 

So we are talking, sometimes she calls sometimes I am, but there is little to none romantic talk up until now. Maybe, somewhat because we haven't actually met IRL. 

And I'm afraid I will unwillingly make her feel like a girlFRIEND and not A girlfriend. Because she seems to be quite shy and usually waits around for me to call, and want's me to ask her out let's me decide what to do etc. Don't know if that is a ""girl thing"" or if she is being shy but yeah.(Mean it in the nicest way possible, not trying to be sexistic).

Whatever, I haven't really met someone for a romantic reason since highschool I think, and how serious was relations back then anyways? So In the end, I'm a grown up and don't have the skill-set to even think of a date and do something romantic, but not too romantic. Would feel very awkward and stupid to turn up with flowers and take her to the beach. 

I mean I find it difficult-awkwardly confusing, to be 1. Romantic, yet not awkward 2. Not come off as a tryhard 3. Start out our relationship as a romantic one and not friendly 4. Again avoiding friendzoning her, but not being too much at once.

**Short version:**
This girl likes me, but I have since long forgotten what a date is. I also have a tendency to befriend ""hinting"" girls instead of flirting. How do I approach this girl and not end up in /r/tifu. How is an ideal first date? What should we do, I live in Sweden, the weather is getting cold. How do I NOT look as a tryhard, yet still somewhat romantic. Don't think she will be scared off, but I'm just afraid I will be too friendly and not break the ice.

**My question is; girls, what can you remember of a sweet first date you had in your adult lives? And guys, have you ever felt that you don't know how to set up a perfect first date, would love any kind of advice.**
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: This girl is into me and I like her, I can't date. Where should I take her on our first date and what should we do? How do I get romantic?

I am a senior in college and I am an Accounting major. I am graduating this Fall semester and recently applied to above position with SAP because I have always had a strong interest in Technology. I have used SAP before in a prior Finance internship and really enjoyed it and am motivated/excited to learn more about the system.


I realize that this is not the typical route that most Accounting majors go for when they graduate; most accounting graduates drink the Big-4 Kool Aid hard... However, I have never been one to follow traditional paths and never saw myself being fully happy going the public accounting route.


Anyways... I have an interview coming up and I want to be able to communicate that my Accounting background gives me an edge and will allow me to do well in this position, especially as a FICO functional consultant. 


Can someone who has gone through the interview/hiring process provide some insight? Any advice/tips from anyone would be greatly appreciated!!

Hey guys, I've only been in Houston for 8 months and has a job now. Graduated in December last year, I didn't realize my passion in data science until that point. It's a gap year for me and I'd like to eventually be in grad school next Fall, preferably in Houston/other areas of Texas. 

I came across this program in April and was interested. But this seems to be a new program; I can't find a lot of reviews online. I've also heard that UHD is primarily for undergrad, so I'm not sure if their grad programs are solid. I do find the courses and internship matching process appealing, and in-state tuition is absoultely affordable. Any thought/comment? Thanks!"

Right now I feel very alone and I'm tears. I dont know how to talk to about this, so Im here. I think I'm depressed, I've started thinking very negative thoughts (I have for first time in my life called the national suicide prevention number). I am starting my third year of college. Throughout the brunt of it, I've been pretty miserable. Though I understand some of it are the result of my decisions. 

To begin, I chose my college for very, very wrong reasons. Which is a regret I will carry with me to this day and possibly the rest of my life. I was accepted to UCLA and turned it down for another UC school because my recent ex (emotionally toxic relationship from both of us) attended there and my co-dependency thought we might get back together. To make it worse, my father told me his biggest regret was choosing a college based on a SO at his age and I followed in his footsteps.

I was then placed in an asian specific floor and had trouble making friends because 1) I was still so distraught over my ex that meeting other people didnt fill that hole and 2) I felt very awkward and out of place being white when everyone was asian, from very asian cities who specifically wanted asian friends. I got a bad flu which kinda ruined my efforts to join various things and I ended up writing for the newspaper. After a few months, I eventually realized my ex was stringing me along and just sleeping with me because sex and not because of feelings. I finally blocked him 6 months after breaking up officially.

I began a fwb with one of the editors at the paper. I wasnt very good at writing my first quarter but eventually got better and wrote more longform pieces. But I put the paper before my classes and my GPA began to slip. I really wanted to be an editor - everyone on ed staff is super close. I was really lonely and really friends. Spring quarter arrives and I am 1) hired to be a longform investigative journalist editor and 2) fwb becomes boyfriend, albeit a long distance on since he recently graduated. Summer was lonely because everything left.

Fall comes and I have friends on ed staff and stuff to keep me busy. But I began clashing with the other editor over the work i was supposed to be doing (hired for investigative journalist but they ignored that). I started to develop anxiety as I felt that I was too different from them - didnt have nice clothes, wear enough make up, didnt know enough about journalism to have a say, was trained differently. I started to escape to my bf on the weekends - weekends I should have bonded with them. Was getting crappy grades but too afraid to quit. Frustration builds and this goes on for the year - a cycle of missing events/bonding with them to go to bf because of my anxiety and insecurities around them. Like it felt like my heart would beat out of my chest.

Its nearing the end of the year where people graduate and you move up the editor pole. No one talks about whos moving. I decide to not be a news editor and volunteer for science editor. I tell the other editors and get the science editor. Turns out theyre combining science and news and after it was publicaly announced to everyone i would be editor, the new head editor says she doesnt like my editing and wants someone else but i can ""slowly fizzle out."" I decide to spare my dignity and quit but end up publicly chewing them out (not calling names, just saying it was unfair to fire me if they were unsatisfied with my editing if they never brought it up to me and gave me the chance to improve). 

It was super painful and I feel like I lost all of my friends. I talked to a few off and on but I felt too shitty to go back to the newspaper. I withdrew from them. The mutual friends I had that didnt screw me over would always hang with the ones who did. To kick it all off, I found out my boyfriend (who I felt was the only person I could rely on) cheated on me and my world just fell apart completely. 

I dumped the cheater and spent my summer doing an internship in another state. I barely talked to anyone but one person who helped me a lot through it. I just started my third year and everything reminds me of my time at newspaper or of my ex. Its been really painful and I feel like Ill never get over it. I want to drop out or transfer - but my GPA is too low for that and my parents wouldnt forgive me if I dropped out. Im trying to join new clubs but I feel like people think its weird that I'm an upperclassman attending clubs alone. It feels empty.

 I feel like college is supposed to be the greatest time of your life and I hate it. I hate when my friends tell me how much fun they're having and I'm so jealous. And I have so much anger and resentment to myself and the other editors. Mutual friends posted a photo with all the other editors hanging out and I just lost it. I cried and called the hotline, because honestly I feel like i fucked my life up too much to fix it. I just dont know what to do anymore.

**tl;dr: Chose my school for stupid reasons, got put on a floor I felt uncomfortable in and felt lonely my first year. Got a job my second year and a bf but I got screwed over by people i thought were friends and lost my job and found out bf cheated within the same month last spring. Starting my third year with almost no friends and its very lonely and I feel like shit all the time and have a low stem GPA. Can it get better or did I fuck up my entire college career let alone my life? I just dont want it to hurt anymore.**

TL;DR - I am a nonpartisan veteran now voting for Trump because none of them want him.   I was not going to vote for Trump before two things - the touching humility he showed veterans, and the fake outrage of his admission that women like rich and famous men's attention and rich and famous men talk shit like everyone else.

I am JUST now actually interested in who hits the chair.  Their bullshit just actually pushed my last button.  The best they got is that Trump has game, but not enough to play furniture n'chill?   For a man to be hated by the bush clan, the clinton clan, cheney, every major network, BOTH parties.   THAT is the power I was wanting in Office.   He destroyed the whole lot of them with his first public apology - ""Sorry if you were offended.  Let's get back to the issues.""

That shit was hot.  I am actually registering to vote again after moving here to NJ after Obama's last shit show.  I have never seen an episode of any of his shows, not one beauty pageant, never read his books, and honestly did not trust Trump until they asked him to step aside, and he said:

""No.  You Move.""

I do not know your perjoratives and slang here, but I would like to thank the spineless lot of the war mongers and soul stealers in power and influence for showing me ONE MAN still may have the power to turn it all around.   What will happen when a person gets the Chief seat that owes none of them anything we used to wonder.   Now, I hope to find out.

As far as American politics goes,  Benjamin Franklin was my guy.  I was there when we defended the rights of ENTERTAINERS to be FREE.   I was at the nightclubs where there were hot chicks that would play kiss chase with the tourists.  I could give a damn if a woman in office was pegging her husband while he sodomized a willing intern during the State of the Union, if he didn't try to fuck around with The Consititional Rights of the People, and remembered his BIGGEST jobs are to secure our national defense, promote our economic sovereignty, and to save us from a stupid or greedy Congress.   My life has been pretty hedonistic and not exactly conservative.  I was also in the armed services, having went to bootcamp at 17 registered ""Other"" politically and religiously.  I was serving you citizens and taxpayers, and CELEBRATING what I was securing, (GOD?) BLESSED SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN GOVERNMENT SANCTIONED FREEDOM.  I was ALWAYS against the system, but for the constitution.  I saw Ron Paul as a hope for intelligence.   I saw Bernie as a molotov cocktail, but did not ride that train.  I see Trump as a not-so-humble messenger of the People.  I did not vote for Obama, but I would vote for Ice Cube.  He wouldn't take shit, and he has both business sense and a sense of fun.  I would also vote for a woman, man, transformer, or goddam murloc if they got themselves in office without begging like a pauper and pretending they were not wealthy.

The greedy gravy train of the world wanted to make this a goddam clinton bush snuff film again.   The People wanted a Sanders Trump election.   Sanders was rolled, hard.  I feel for his people.  I respect a LOT of his views, but they are not his message not.  I am not sure if Bush is trying to take it from Trump, or if the Masters of Puppets are gonna try to run Pence further into their game, but I am sold on the consititution of character of Trump to stand FOR those who got him this far.

When the fuck did prude become the new liberal?  I never cared if Bill did whatever to anyone sexually, as long as they wanted it.  My question about legal gay marriage was ""why does the government have a different tax status for people who are married in a world of single parents?""  Taxes should be reasonable, and effective to make our livelyhood something of importance to us.

Some of my friend ask me, ""How do you know you can trust him?""  The fact is, if we can't trust him, neither can they.   Trump 2016!  (first time I ever wrote that!)"
56kmjm,5,2016-10-08,Is this internship worth paying for or am I better off planning my own trip?,bondcroft,australia,https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/56kmjm/is_this_internship_worth_paying_for_or_am_i/,"I am a student in the US and I have always wanted to visit Australia. During this upcoming summer of 2017 there is an intern abroad program through my school where you pay somewhere between 6-7 thousand dollars to stay there for a few months. They assign you an internship based on your major and your housing is covered in that cost. The extra money I'd bring would be for food shopping and entertainment. 

A part of me feels as though this is a ripoff but the other part of me feels like if I did all of this myself I might not actually be saving much money. I am also not afraid of traveling alone.

For example, during that time a roundtrip ticket would cost me around $1,400USD. The work visa would cost me like $350, then my passport would cost $150 or so. Housing for 3 or 4 months could run me up to 4 grand if I found a decent apartment in Sydney and that's assuming they'll even let me rent for that short of a time period. And then there's buying food and paying for entertainment. As for the internship, I don't really know if it would actually have much of an impact on my future employment. I feel like it would mostly consist of basic desk work that company doesn't want to pay anyone else to do. I think if I worked hard at networking I MIGHT be able to find a decent job somewhere that will add something of value to my resume. To be honest I'd like to actually stay for a full year. I would live in Australia if I got a company to sponsor me.

So what do you think? Am I better off planning my own trip? Or should I just pay the money and go with my school to save me from the stress?"
56kn2o,222,2016-10-08,"My ex [27 F], who I [23 F] had been rekindling with, threw my laptop out of an 8th story building and I called the cops on her.",Newman5317,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/56kn2o/my_ex_27_f_who_i_23_f_had_been_rekindling_with/,"So I was in an abusive relationship with my ex-girlfriend for a little over a year that I left around 2.5 months ago to salvage my well-being. Around a month ago, she showed up at my new apartment, claiming that she found the address from her friend's Instagram and saw my photos (I made the mistake of geotagging my new apartment name on a recent post - don't do this people). Having been at a very emotionally vulnerable state (I just went through a break up with a person who was abusive but I loved, I had no friends in the new city, and grad school was hard), I actually welcomed her presence back into my life....which everyone around me was wary about. I knew it was not a good idea, but ignored my friends' warnings because I was suddenly happy again and she seemed like she had sincere intentions with me. She was so sweet and apologetic...


Any way, we have been regularly seeing each other for about 4 weeks, once or twice a week. We also had sex. We weren't arguing and everything seemed fine. I would frequently bring up the fact that we weren't back together and that I was free to go on dates with whoever I wanted because that was another big reason to why I left the relationship - my curiosity of other people. She was always bothered by these talks, but accepted any way because she ""didn't want to lose me"" (her words).


So she spent the night two nights ago because on Fridays she has a part-time in my neighborhood and I invited her to stay the night so she didn’t have to sit in traffic to commute in the morning. The next morning, she woke up and told me she wasn’t feeling that well and said she would call into work sick. She seemed fine so I was a little bit bothered by her seeming laziness but I was going to run late to my internship so I left abruptly saying she can stay in my apartment until she feels better and can head home, literally not worrying about anything. A couple hours into my internship, I get a text from her saying that what I’m doing is unfair and that we needed to have a conversation that night. I called her on my way home and she told me she read through my texts (on my laptop that is linked to my imessages – I don’t even remember giving her my computer account password….) with two girls that I went on dates with from right after my ex and I broke up. She couldn’t believe that I could move on so quickly. I sped home and when I entered, I saw one of my windows wide open (I live on the 8th floor). My ex was packing up to leave. I asked her where my laptop was sternly and she said she didn’t know. I noticed that she had her laptop on my bed so I grabbed it and said I wouldn’t give it back until she told me where mine was. She immediately attacked me and pinned me to the ground, trying to take the laptop off my hands. She is quite small so I was able to free myself and leave the room. I was so terrified because she was physically hurting me. I went down to the lobby and explained what happened to the front desk guy and he told me I should call the police. 


Around 15 minutes later, of me sitting disheveled and barefoot in the lobby, the cops came and asked me standard questions about what happened, where she touched me, and what she was wearing, etc. They told me wait downstairs as they went to talk to her. I don’t know how much time had passed but maybe 5 minutes later I decided to go up because I was getting so antsy. I got out of the elevator on my floor and saw my ex being handcuffed….I had no idea they were actually going to arrest her. I didn’t know what the protocol was – I called them at a panicked state. My ex had never hurt me physically before. I was thinking that they would try to calm her down and write down information to hold her legally responsible for my laptop damage if she indeed threw it out the window, which was confirmed that she did.


Any way, she was arrested and now I am in serious shock. Even if she definitely has severe mental issues and is unbelievably abusive, this is someone that I loved for over a year….One of the cops told me that she told him she would pay for a new one, but I don’t think her stating this to the cop is legally binding. I don’t even know how much I should ask for. My original laptop when purchased 3 years ago was $1,500 but it definitely depreciated. Do I ask her to buy me a brand new device? Obviously I have great trauma from her and frankly don’t even want to reach out to her. I don’t really know what legality is involved in this, but I really don’t want to press any charges because I don’t want to complicate mine or her life further. But the finance is a big problem for me….And of course emotional damage but I can’t do anything about that besides decompress and move on. What should be my next step? 
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My ex got angry and possessive over reading some of my text exchanges with girls I’ve been talking to and threw my laptop out of my window. She also physically prevented me from leaving the apartment by pushing me. I didn’t mean to get her arrested but I was so scared that I called the police and they said as long as they were called for a domestic violence issue, they had to take the aggressor to jail.

here's my story, hope it's not too long:
dear people of the internet, things are getting worse by every week. nearly every week something else hits me harder than ever.
let's start back when most of my demons are coming from. one and a half a year ago i lived 2 months in a foreign city for an internship. he was the only roommate and also the only social contact I had (including his friends I got to know). I had a huge crush, since we skyped for the room. I know I fall easily in love with someone and usually I try to give myself at least some weeks to get to know the other person, because in the past this led to a lot of hurt in others, because we dated really intensive and then I suddenly lost interest or thought damn this is just not right, I just fell out of love as easily as that. Well in this new city there was no one to stop me and I was too thrilled by this guy. We kissed the second day and we agreed it wouldn't be a clever idea to have sex if we want to be roommates for the next 2 months. 1 week passed and I couldn't think of something else than him. It happened and he said ""there won't be anything else than sex"". At this point I think I was already so blinded and had the pink glasses on so that I thought ""maybe if we have sex he will fall in love with me too!"". never talked about it, usually I have two ways of coping with guys: a) I'm super shy and self-conscious, can't even stand a normal date with talking because I get so nervous and usually think I'm the worst for the other person or b) I will get madly drunk and get home with a guy on a party, because that's where I can get at least a little sense of intimacy. It sounds so odd, I know :( Usually the one night stands leave a really depressed feeling on me, the day after. I tried to not get so drunk so I can stop doing that. Well, the hopeful thought he will fall in love with me too shattered throughout these two month. He began treating me like trash, I felt used and I couldn't get myself out of this situation. It felt like I was raping myself. I mean I was so dumb and naively in love and everytime we had sex I thought he would stay for cuddling or something. He didn't even kissed me, he just had rough sex with me thats it. The thing is I didn't realized it I didn't wanted sex. Sometimes he just came in my room while I was watching something and he didn't even asked me if he can touch me. He just went on like it was something normal. That time I didn't knew about sexual consent. I have a strong mind so I always said to myself, while he was overwhelming me ""that's something you should do, it's sex"". I can't remember if I enjoyed it. The most confusing thing was that my body was reacting different than my heart (i got aroused during the intercourse, but before I didn't wanted to). My heart was breaking into tiny shattered pieces, day by day. I can't even say what I was feeling that time. I wasn't actually sad. I think it was more a shock state. I was smoking a lot of cigarettes just to help the feeling of being useless, worthless, whatever. Sometimes I was quiet drunk when we slept together and I was just like a doll, letting him switch poses how he wanted. Everytime I think back to those weeks I feel like I need to throw up so hard. In this time, I had a lot of passive suicidal thoughts. It was the only way out. I had no one to talk to and whom should I talk to? I wasn't even realizing what was wrong. That this guy was wrong and not me. Now I know what sexual consent really means. first asking if the person wants to and if it's okay to touch her/him in this kind of way and not expecting them to like everything at every time. very few times i wanted to sleep with him, but most of the time I thought I should. I read too much about friends about benefits and stuff like this, so I thought this is how it should work in this ""new age"". I never said to him I was in love, I was way too shy for that. I couldn't even say my mind. There were so many little things that led to the whole aweful picture. He was so disrespectful to me, he was so shameless with touching me whenever he pleased and he never even cared a bit about my well-being. He also always said something bad about me too, like the way I do things was always wrong. And one or two times he had a ""clear"" moment, and he said he is very disrespectufl. But the worst thing is I know I wasn't able to rescue myself out of this situation. If I didn't had to leave the city for my studies in my hometown (which is thank god far away), I don't know how long I would have stayed in this thing. It was aweful. After that I cut all contact, which was at least something I can. I had one normal semester, barely thought about this thing. The I went one semester abroad. It was the best experience of my life. For the first time I felt peace. I had no responsibilities and I met nice friends and we had a great time travelling together. After 5 month, I went back to my parents home. I cried, I wanted to go back but first I had to finish my studies, there was still my bachelor thesis. I got used to the situation being back in my home country, I made another drunk mistake, but you know, if you do something like this too often you get numbed. Another guy that rejected me and wasn't interested in my personality or my life. He just wanted to have sex.
So now I am here, I have a really nice boyfriend right now but I still battle everyday with the demons of that. 
what is wrong with me? have I done something wrong or was he just too manipulative? What exactly is it? My counselor didn't said anything, but he treated it like it was rape but I have the feeling it's more that I raped myself with him, if you know what I mean?

In an ABC News interview in 1992, Hillary smears Gennifer Flowers, a women Bill would later admit to having an affair with, as “some failed cabaret singer who doesn’t even have much of a résumé to fall back on.” Hillary also referred to Flowers as “trailer trash.”

#2 Hillary slams former White House intern Monica Lewinsky as a “narcissistic loony toon” after she had consensual relations with her husband in the Oval Office.

CBS News reports: ""According to the friend, Diane Blair -- a political science professor whose papers were donated to the University of Arkansas Special Collections library – Hillary Clinton credited Bill Clinton with trying to break away from Lewinsky, whom she called a 'narcissistic loony toon.'""

#3 Hillary, defending an alleged rapist, smears his 12-year-old alleged rape victim, claiming the young girl had a ""tendency to seek out older men."" She also laughs on tape over the cunning way she had vital evidence dismissed, destroying the alleged rape victim's case. 

“I have been informed that the complainant is emotionally unstable with a tendency to seek out older men and engage in fantasizing,” Hillary wrote in the affidavit about the 12-year-old girl. 

Hillary is even captured on tape laughing at the fact that she got the only piece of evidence against her client dismissed: “He took a lie detector test. I had him take a polygraph, which he passed, which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs,” Hillary says, audibly laughing. 

The alleged rape victim told The Daily Beast what she would say to Hillary if she ever has the chance: ""‘You took a case of mine in ’75, you lied on me… I realize the truth now, the heart of what you’ve done to me. And you are supposed to be for women? You call that [being] for women, what you done to me? And I hear you on tape laughing.'""

#4 Hillary disparagingly refers to the numerous women her husband was involved with as “bimbos.""

In 1991, Mrs. Clinton called the onslaught of women accusing her husband of sexual misconduct or consensual infidelity as the “bimbo eruption.”

#5 Hillary reportedly threatens Juanita Broaddrick, Bill's alleged rape victim, into silence at a political fundraiser after the accused rape. 

According to Broaddrick, Hillary threatened her while knowing her husband had raped her:

Hillary sought out Broaddrick at the political fundraiser after Bill had raped her; she grabbed her hand and “thanked her” for “everything” she had done for Bill. Feeling frightened, Broaddrick says she tried to turn around and leave, but Hillary allegedly squeezed her hand tighter and wouldn't let her go. 

Broaddrick told The Daily Wire that there was ""no way"" Hillary did not intend for that interaction to be construed as a threat.

“So many people have said since then that, ‘Maybe she just knew that you had been with him, maybe he hadn’t told her the complete description of what he’d done to you,’” she said. “I still feel like she knew.”

#6 “I mean, I would crucify her,” Hillary says of Gennifer Flowers.

Hillary ""told Esquire magazine in 1992 that if she had the chance to cross-examine Flowers, 'I mean, I would crucify her,'"" notes The Washington Post. ​

#7 ""[W]e have to destroy her story,"" Hillary allegedly said of one woman state troopers sought out for her husband to have a sexual encounter with. 

As noted by National Review: ""When a rock groupie alleged that a state trooper approached her on Governor Clinton’s behalf, Hillary said 'we have to destroy her story.'"""

Almost like it doesn't want to disturb the peace of the people working in the well-lit bank. I stare out over the busy little bees, running with their paperwork across the big hall.

I snap out of it and look down at the table in front of me, only 1 donut left. *I don't like donuts, who am I kidding* I think to myself as I close the box and glance at the clock. 4 minutes left of my break. *Might aswell get back to it* I think and turn to head down the stairs to the ground floor of the bank but stop dead in my tracks as I hear a gunshot, the sound echoing in the dead silent hall.

""You fucking know the drill people, shut the fuck up and get down on the ground!"" I hear a man yell on the ground floor, only me and 2 others are on the upper level where our breaks take place. *Perhaps they don't know we are here* I think to myself, *Unless it's an inside job* I continue in my head as I'm interrupted so rudely by a masked man coming up the stairs. ""Get down with the others, that goes for you too sugar"" he growls.

Moments later I find myself staring eye to eye with the white tiled floor. Only muffled sounds are heard from inside the vault as they are clearing it out. Every now and then, I take a look up around me, scouting for the guy who wants to be a hero, but no one else dares to blink. ""Hey blondie, get the fuck down"" I hear from the vault opening as they exit the vault. And then they are gone, just like that.

The next day, we dont have to work, but we still need to come in for the debrief of what happend. The bank manager wants to interview everyone about the situation, he went alphabetically so I'm last on the list.

The sun has already gone down when I enter my, not so well-lit, workplace. The only light comes from the office of our bank manager and it's blocked as he steps out of it, blocking the light. ""Ah, Amanda, glad you could make it. You are last so please lock the door, we dont want any more incidents like last night, do we?"" He says and nods to the exit. I nod back and go over and lock it before approaching him and being shown in.

He closes the office door behind me. ""There, have a seat"" He says, pointing at a black chair. ""Here, have a donu-.."" He begins as he opens the empty box filled with crumbs. ""Or dont."" He walks to his side of the table.

""Well, well, well Amanda, what are we going to do with you?"" He begins as he ruffles around his desk. ""Ehm...I guess I wa-.."" I start but stops as he raises his hand to silence me.

""You don't think I'm an idiot, do you Amanda?"" He begins. ""No sir?"" I answer. ""You don't think I know what you did? What you are doing?"" He continues. ""I'm not sure I'm following you."" I reply.

""These clueless fucking interns"" He mumbles to himself. ""Gets younger every year.""

""You sit there, with your cleavage and that short skirt, blonde ponytail put up in a mess, thinking a smile can get you off anything but no....honey...this is the real world now. Here, you dont fucking unbutton half your blouse even if God blessed your rack. You dont drop a pencil in the middle of a conference to stop those old corporate people in their tracks, yeah I saw you. You dont let your trashy boyfriends go in and out of our staff entrance.""

""Sir, I di-"" I try to stop him but he raises his hand again.

""And you don't, no matter how much your brain has been fucked out, aid criminals, in robbing the very bank you WORK IN!!"" He yells at me. ""A fucking retard can look at that tape and see that they know exactly where to go, and you just fucking stand there staring while you know full well that there is an alarm button behind THE COFFEE MAKER!!"" He yells again as he slams the desk and rises from his chair. Starting slowly to walk around it.

""Now, I trust you locked the door Amanda, we wouldn't want anyone interrupting our....performance evaluation, do we?"" He says as he stops behind my chair. I hear a belt unbuckle.

""I've seen the way you look at me Amanda, and you shouldn't be ashame."" He begins as he places his wallet, keys and watch on the table by the door. ""It's only natural, you aren't showing those tits of yours off for no reason."" He continues as he motions for me to stand.

56p7f8,1,2016-10-09,Encounters With The Beast - Peony,smileydooby,MattSmiley,https://www.reddit.com/r/MattSmiley/comments/56p7f8/encounters_with_the_beast_peony/,"I’ve lived a long, full life, filled with riches beyond the needs of any mortal. These old, slowly failing eyes have seen thrilling adventures, the likes that could fill an adolescent’s bookcase several times over.

Unfortunately I haven’t decided to tell those stories at this time. No, there’s a whole other part of my life that I feel urged to tell you about now. These are not the stories that a child would want to read, of success and gain. These are the stories of the other times, when things didn’t go my way.

***

The summer after high school, I met Susie. She was the most pleasant smelling hippie I’d met. A single peony flower stood in her blonde locks, settled over a turquoise flower painted poncho covering what must have been a mini skirt. Knee high black boots, muddied by an admiration for nature. Glinting diamond earrings, that told my keen eyes that she was hiding wealth of some magnitude behind her peasants gown.

Susie, or rather, Mary-Sue as her family knew her, stood in stark contrast to the business suit I had acquired to make me look older than I was. My auburn hair was just long enough to part down the side, any longer and my father would have disowned me. I had planned to apply for an internship at the local newspaper that day, but as luck would have it, that plan soon changed.

I had parked my bike a block away, and walked down the busy sidewalk. Sweat beaded at my brow despite the cool early summer breeze. It’s not that I was nervous about the interview; my father had set it up and had assured me that the job was mine for the taking. Lingering in the back of my head, though, a constant, unrelenting fear pressed against the front of my skull. I didn’t want the job, I wanted a reason to walk away.

Susie, unfortunately enough, became that reason when she stepped out from a local flower shop and into my path. Our collision, though startling, didn’t hurt either of us. My eyes lurched up from the ground as soon as we made impact. Out of instinct, my young hands instinctively wrapped around to steady her from falling.

“I’m so sorry!” I said, laughing awkwardly. She steadied herself quickly, but I was too distracted by my clumsiness to realize I should let go. “Are you okay?” My question came bumbling out as though I’d never been taught anything by my father.

“It’s alright, I obviously shouldn’t have had those eyes in the back of my head removed, but they made finding the right hat impossible!” Her smile was like a sun, shedding its light on my soul.

My recollection has hazed over the years, but in that moment I remember thinking she appeared as an impossible painting. Colors too vivid to be brushed, too vivid to set on canvas by a mere mortal.

“Hands, stranger.” Came a voice from next to her. The realization that it was directed at me brought my mind back into focus. Embarrassed by my unintentional grasp, I let go quickly and turned away from them.

“Sorry about that, I didn’t realize.” I said to the air, not expecting a reply. I turned my head back to them, and found an extended hand to shake. This was the first time I’d seen the person talking to me. A tall bearded man, long brown hair below a folded blue handkerchief on his head. He wore dirty old blue jeans and open toed sandals on his feet. His white button up shirt was anything but buttoned up, with a black leather vest over top. “My name’s Miller, Hank Miller.” I said, accepting his handshake.

“I dig it, Miller. I’m Mark and this here is Susie.” His grip on my hand loosened, and let go, but his eyes didn’t waver from mine. “We were just getting meeting here to go on a hike, would you like to join?” He asked.

Any guilt I would have had for skipping my job interview was melted away when I returned my eye to the lovely Susie, her eyes lit as she smiled broadly. “How can I refuse?” I said.

***

That summer I learned more than any job could have taught, more than any schooling could have prepared me for. The three of us quickly became best friends, despite our obvious differences. I eventually gave into my father’s demands and took the internship at the local paper, but spent all of my spare time with my new best friends.

Mark clearly coveted Susie, that much was obvious, but he didn’t let it be known to either of us blatantly except for once. Deep in the woods on a trail that no map we could find detailed, he allowed Susie to gain a considerable distance ahead of us and pulled me aside. “I’ll only tell you this once.” I remember him saying, his blue eyes staring heavy into mine. “If you ever hurt her, I will destroy you.”

I laughed awkwardly, having known for some time that this conversation had been inevitable. His speech struck me as more of a big brother warning than a jealous friend. He continued to stare at me until my smile left and I nodded understanding. We hastened our pace in silence until we caught up to Susie on the path.

We missed several opportunities to join together, the three of us, in the following weeks. At first I was insecure, thinking they had lost interest in befriending a city boy. Then, late into my shift at the paper, while I was mopping an already cleaned section of floor, Mark came in to see me. I looked past him, but didn’t see Susie anywhere.

“Hey, Miller. Have you seen Susie lately?” He asked abruptly.

“I haven’t seen her in a couple of weeks.” I answered, putting the mop back into the soapy bucket and swishing it around. “Why do you ask?”

Mark fidgeted with a button on his vest for a moment, while staring at the wet floor. “It’s nothing, man.” He finally said. “It’s just that ever since she got that book, she’s been acting strangely. You know, preoccupied.”

I thought for a second, stilling the mop with my hand. “Maybe she’s just high?” I remembered back to all those camping trips, that always ended with a tab of acid on our tongues, followed by hours of laughter and disparate howls at the moon.

“Nah, man. I know when she’s high. Susie doesn’t avoid me just because she’s tripping. It’s something else.” He looked around the empty room and leaned into me. “You said it yourself, Miller. Even you haven’t seen her in weeks. You know that’s not like her. Even high as a kite, Susie can’t resist herself some Miller time.”

I smiled, but my stomach turned to worried knots inside me. He was right, this wasn’t like her, and I’d been too consumed with thinking I’d been exiled to realize that something was genuinely wrong. “Do you have any idea where she is now?” I asked.

“Yeah, man. She’s at her old man’s place.” He said. “She won’t let me in to see her. Maybe she’d let you in?”

“Do you think that would help?”

“Can you come with me and try?”

I looked around at the mess on the floor, and the clock saying I still had half an hour in my shift. I took a deep breath and let go of the mop. It fell to the floor behind me, the bucket spilling out with it. After a minute of fidgeting to lock up the storefront, we were walking the short distance to Susie’s father’s apartment.

It was a relatively new apartment, on top of a brand new market in our growing town. Bill, Susie’s dad, often bragged at the price he was able to get the landlord to agree to. The entrance to his studio was behind the market, up a flight of stairs from the alleyway. We walked there quickly, as the sun was beginning to hang low on the horizon.

Mark, who had been leading the way, stopped at the base of the stairs, and said. “Maybe she’ll be more receptive if you’re the one who knocks on the door.”

I flashed him a concerned look, realizing just how surreal all this was, and began traversing the metal stairway. “Susie, it’s Hank. Can we talk?” I asked after knocking several times.

The door slowly opened, revealing the expansive living room only lit via sporadically placed candles.  “Thank God it’s you two.” She exclaimed, closing the door behind us. We made our way to a large L shaped sofa in the middle of the large living room. “I need your help.” She said with a tension in her voice I hadn’t heard before. “I have to show you something.”

We took a seat on separate sections of the sofa and each leaned over, onto our knees nervously. “It’s been a while, Susie.” I finally said in an attempt to lighten the mood. She came back from another room and I could see that her hair hadn’t been washed or brushed in weeks. “What have you been up to?”

Her eyes appeared heavy, she clearly hadn’t been sleeping. The candlelight couldn’t hide the fact that she hadn’t changed out of her blue polkadotted sun dress in a while. “Well,” She said, taking the adjacent seat across from both of us. She sat a large, leather bound book in her lap. “I found this book a couple of weeks ago.”

“What kind of book is it?” I asked.

“Well, it doesn’t actually have a title.” Susie said with an awkward laugh, raising it to show them the empty black cover. “On the last page, someone has scribbled the words ‘Lost Volume o Grimoire?’ But nowhere that I’ve read so far actually names itself. It’s written mostly in an archaic english, though, so I doubt it can be *that* old.” She said with a sense sarcasm and something else in her voice.

“You’ve read it?” Mark asked. I turned to see him gazing at her, flushed with concern. “All of it?”

“I’ve done more than read it, Mark!” She burst into tears, collapsing her head down into the book on her lap. Mark leaped over to her quickly to offer a comforting hug. I followed, placing a shaky hand on her back.

“It’s okay, Susie. I’m here for you.” Mark whispered to her. “Tell us what happened.”

After a moment of inconsolability, she regained some composure. “I read one of the latin parts out loud before I’d had a chance to translate it.” She was sniffling, her breath short and frantic. “I think I let out the beast. I didn’t mean to, I swear.” Her hoarse voice yelled out. “You’ve got to believe me!”

I thought to myself, that maybe I’d been right all along. Perhaps this was just a bad trip, or someone had messed with the formula. I’d heard of that happening in neighboring cities. There had even been an article written about it in the paper I worked at.

Before I could gather my thoughts enough to ask, Mark began. “Susie, listen to me. How do you know that you let out the beast?”

Susie raised her head from the book with a questioning look. “I know because the second I finished, all of the candles spontaneously blew out. The floor beneath me began to shake, and a hideous rumbling noise came up from under me, getting louder and louder until it surrounded me.” Her voice calmed down but her breathing remained as frantic as I’d ever heard.

“Then it appeared. A thing I’d never seen before. A being of pure evil, blacker than the deepest cave, but see-through at the edges, like it was phasing in an out of our plane of existence. It was tall, with legs shaped like a clydesdale. Hunched over, it must have stood two feet taller than me. When it turned I could see its arms didn’t hold a human shape at all, but moved fluidly like snakes. A single great horn hung on its head, and I swear to you that instead of eyes, I saw nothing but the deepest red embers of the hottest fire.”

“I’m so sorry, Susie. You’re gonna be okay. I promise you.” Mark tried to comfort her, raising her up from the chair to embrace. The book fell on the floor and opened to a page in the middle. There, unfolded stood a drawing of a creature so ugly, so putrid, that I nearly choked, trying to keep myself from vomiting on the floor. It was exactly as she had explained.

“How did you escape?” I asked.

“I ran.” Susie looked up at me, her eyes glazed over from the sleepless nights. “I went straight out of the apartment, through downtown, and out into the forest. I ran until my feet gave out, I collapsed in a clearing, and slept under the stars.” She raised an arm from Mark’s back and motioned me to join them in their hug. “The next day I came back, and the place was empty. My dad’s been gone for a week, and I think…” Her voice trailed off again.

“We’ll find him.” I tried to sound reassuring, and failed.

“The beast took him, I know it,” She took several shallow breaths, and wiped a tear onto my shoulder with her cheek. “and it’s coming back for me.”

As though on cue, the room instantly became dark. All the candles blew out like the air had been vacuumed out. A deep rumbling began from somewhere below, slowly becoming louder, closer. Susie wretched herself from our grasp. Screaming, she sprinted for the door. I swallowed dryly, and followed as quickly as I could.

The noise from within the room, reached deafening levels when I made it past the threshold and onto the stairs. Once out of the apartment, the sounds seemed to vanish, allowing me to hear the evening traffic in the distance. “Susie!” I called out, as I huddled down the stairs after her.

She had made it to the main street when I finally caught up to her. Her eyes, crazed in panic, wouldn’t register me until I had her arms in my grips. “You have to let me go!” She shouted. “It’s going to kill me!” My hands didn’t want to leave a bruise on her fragile skin, and let go.

In an instant she had fled into the street, me only a foot behind, but a foot too late. The car didn’t have a chance to hit the brakes before she tumbled up the bumper, over the hood and into the windshield. When It finally lurched to a stop, her body flung off the car, smacking her head hard onto the concrete.

***

I never saw Mark again, or Susie’s father. Officially they’re both missing persons. Until now, I’ve left a single peony flower on that street corner every year since. A tribute to a summer’s love lost; and a reminder to myself that sometimes a bruise can be the lesser of [two evils](https://www.facebook.com/SmileyDooby/)."

56q0jy,7,2016-10-09,Autopsy,GreazyPieces,creepypasta,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/56q0jy/autopsy/,"	My name is Dave. I work a at a teaching hospital in New York City. I am on the team that preforms the more routine autopsies, as in the more diagnostic cases and not the crime related ones, those duties fall to the criminal pathologists. This position keeps me in the morgue most of the time but the pay is nice and I have quite a knack for figuring these cases out so I was pretty excited when the hospital offered me a full time fellowship after my time as an intern and a resident.
	I walked into the hospital on this particular Tuesday to start my shift. I got on the elevator and descended to the sub level where the morgue is located. Only the most used hallways are lit down here to conserve power as our hospital is part of a green movement. Most of the basement floor is not used anyways, at least not anymore. There are mostly just empty rooms or rooms being used for storage for old equipment that is pretty obsolete. Then there is the morgue itself, our lab and a locker room with showers that are still in use by the employees who work down here. It has an eerie vibe to it knowing this is where all of the bodies are kept but I never believed in anything supernatural so it didn’t take long for me to get used to it.
	I walked into the lab where my station is located and was met by my co-worker Charles who is also my superior. We exchanged hellos then got right down to business. Charles explained to me that a patient was admitted to the ER with extreme abdominal pain. The pain started during a camping trip in some woods not far from the city. The trip was cut short and a friend who was there on the trip as well rushed the patient to the hospital. He went on saying that the patient began screaming and convulsing before dying on the spot. 
	I walked over to the operating table where the patient was laying and pulled back the sheet to observe. It was a male, mid-thirties. The stomach area was bloated and bruised, I could tell there was quite a bit of blood internally puddling. There were also trails of blood running from the mouth and both nostrils. It was obvious the patient had experienced some sort of severe hemorrhaging but I had no idea what could have caused this and so suddenly. The medical record revealed the man to be quite a healthy specimen.
	I knew I was in for a long night so I told Charles I wanted to head upstairs and get a meal and some coffee before the cafeteria closed for the evening. He said that was fine as long as I didn’t take too long and that we would begin when I got back. The cafeteria was fairly empty, it usually is by this time of night. There is a pretty large night shift staff but it is a lot smaller compared to the day shift. I ate my chicken salad sandwich and fries rather quick, topped off my coffee and started my trek back to the basement.
	I got off the elevator and started down the hallway, passing the other dark hallways and blackened rooms. When suddenly I seen something out of the corner of my eye. I quickly turned to see something scurry quickly down the hallway. We have had rats get in here before a few times and have had to call exterminators but this didn’t look at all like that. I didn’t get a good look at it but it was much bigger than any rat I’ve ever seen, even for New York. It was about the size of a large cat but shaped completely different. I could have sworn in had a lot more legs than any mammal. Like an insect of some kind and it moved in a similar fashion to one. It startled me a bit and I stared down the dark corridor thinking about investigating it but I was a bit startled and decided to hurry back to the lab and let and tell Charles I seen something and get his opinion.
	When I got back I found the room empty. I didn’t see Charles anywhere. I called his name and got no reply. As I walked across the room I noticed something odd about our patient. It looked like the autopsy had been started without me. The bodies was completely cut open. I got closer and seen that the internal organs had all been removed. I checked the scales and they were all completely clean, no blood, unused. I thought Charles had begun without me and had removed the innards to weigh and inspect but that wasn’t the case. They were just gone and so was he.  Then I noticed the weirdest thing the body was not cut with the surgical precision of a scalpel, it appeared to be ripped or torn open. There was a small trail of blood coming from the body, across the table and on the floor, leading to a small puddle.
	I began to freak out a little bit and quickly ran into the hallway and began searching for Charles. I called his name over and over getting no reply. I used the flashlight on my phone to illuminate the empty rooms but there was no sign of him. I even entered the old dark hallways searching franticly for him. Several times as my light flashed by the dark rooms and shadowy corners I thought I seen the movement of the small spiderlike creature again. I began to panic and decided I was going to get the hell out of there and just notify security. As I headed towards the elevator I passed the locker room and thought I heard someone inside.
	I slowly opened the door and the sound became much clearer. The first thing I noticed was the sound of the shower running, Then I realized whoever was back there was crying, crying in pain. I slowly headed for the shower room with my phone lighting the way. I crept around the corner breathing in short panicked gasps when the light from my phone illuminated the form of a naked man crouched under the running water. I tried to call out Charles name but it just came out as a mumbled frightened sound. The man then slowly stood up and turned to face me. It was Charles, he started to walk towards me, his arm stretched out and reaching for me. He was crying and begging for help. Blood ran from his mouth and both nostrils. The sight scared me so bad I started to step back from him franticly and my leg hit a bench. I fell back and felt my head on the floor hard. Then everything went black.
	I don’t know how long I was out. I woke up dizzy and my vision was slightly blurred. I could make out Charles slumped against the wall across from me. He was dead. His stomach was torn open the same way the body in the morgue was and like that body he no longer had any internal organs. He was just sitting there, a husk, in a pool of his own blood. I tried to stand but I couldn’t. I was in too much pain. My stomach was cramping worse than I ever had felt. No, it wast cramping. It felt like I was being eaten alive from the inside out. I wiped the blood flowing from my nose and mouth and let myself collapse back to the floor. As the world started fading away from me I could feel the muscles and flesh around my stomach begin to tear open."
56q3xx,14,2016-10-09,This History of SourceFed,UrSh4d0w,SourceFed,https://www.reddit.com/r/SourceFed/comments/56q3xx/this_history_of_sourcefed/,"After some of the recent posts going through this thread, and some of the negativity, as well as seeing that some/most people really don't know the origins of SourceFed. I decided that it could be useful to make a post about it for those interested. So let's start at the beginning:

SourceFed was originally created by the man himself, Philly D, because he felt that there was so many good news stories out there that he couldn't cover them all. He wanted a channel that was dedicated to those other stories, and that's where SourceFed came from and their original plan of 5 stories in 20 minutes or less, with each story having its own video. I was among the crew of beautiful bastards that chose to subscribe to this channel before it had a single video because of my following of Philly D and my interest in his take on the stories.

So that's when Lee, Joe, and Elliot (or the OG3 as I will call them from now on) step in. They had a TON of work to do, generating 5 scripts for 5 stories they had to find themselves, and with the help of the nation. This workload was quite a lot for them, but they pushed through and even generated some unique ideas that required extra work, such as Comment Commentaries. 

With this extra work, our very own Steve stepped into the picture, first as someone helping behind the scenes and then in front of the camera. This helped take off some of the pressure from the OG3 because now they had an extra person at the table to cover the 5 stories a day and Comment Commentary.

So with that, came the two lovely ladies Trish and Meg, both of which started out as guests and then came on as full time. With them joining the roster, formed the 6 person crew.

Now keep in mind, they were bringing on all of these people to help generate their 5 stories a day plus additional content. Well, as time went on, some of their stories were overlapping with Philly D's stories, so they stopped pushing for the 5 stories a day and went with 2-3. This gave their 6 person squad time to look into other content.

This is when things like Table Talk, an outlet for Meg and Steve to rif back and forth, but also things like Head2Head. 

The Head2Head, and the like, are very important in this story because this is where SourceFed Nerd popped up from. Phil had tried a year or so ago to make a nerd/gaming channel called Like Totally Awesome (LTA), which never really took off. Phil opted to give this channel a new name, SFN, and the reigns over to our 3 lovely nerds, Meg, Trish, and Steve

Now we have SF and SFN with 6 total hosts, where the OG3 focused on SF and our nerds on SFN. 

The seventh host, Ross, is the one where I'm a bit fuzzy on his induction to the SF family, but I think it was just before SFN was created. Anyone feel free to correct me and I'll edit my post accordingly. The correct story, as shown by u/Thekibaman, is that Ross was working behind the scenes as a writer before getting in front of the camera.

So with that we have 7 hosts across 2 channels, and eventually back to 6 once Ross dipped, or rather went behind the camera again and then left.

Now from here is where the first 6 began to leave and in their place came Reina, Will, Sam, Bree, Matt, Maude, Candace, Phil, Mike, and many others. u/argella1300 has pointed out, and something I had forgotten to mention, that Sam, Will, and Reina were all interns before stepping in front of the camera. There is one video early on where Elliot fights an intern with those styrofoam sticks with head gear, and that intern was Will. I am not sure which one it is, but feel free to comment down below and I'll add the think to this post! 

I am sorry that I am hazy on when each of the 6 began to leave and who effectively took their place. Life got in the way and I couldn't follow SF as closely. Again, feel free to correct me and I'll edit this to follow.

From there, most of the crew here on the subreddit knows the rest. So the real question is, why am I posting this? Well like I said, I wanted to give some background into SF and SFN for those who didn't know, but to also provide some context into what the old timers remember the most about SF and SFN.

Ultimately, there isn't a real agenda to saying this besides that. I just wanted to share what I knew and hopefully get everyone on the same page.

Although I don't follow nearly as closely as I used to, both Philly D and the plethora of SF spurred channels, I wanted to say that although the channel is changing, you hosts are killing it with what you are changing it into. Some people may not love the direction, I am actually one of them, but the stuff being made on Nuclear Family, People Be Like, SF and SFN, is all GREAT content regardless of what direction you all have chosen for it!

Edit 1: made a couple of changes based on some users noting some extra things in the story"

Like most of you here I just wanted to take an opportunity to thank you all for posting. You guys are the best and I am so glad I found this sub. I've been smoking around a gram a day for 6 years, and am ready to move on from the fog and slumber that was my weed life. For years I could finish work and school with minimal effort, and felt good doing so. But it hasn't been enough, and I'm starting to recognize the wasted time and money. In five years I'm looking at almost 20k (USD) on weed alone. That was cringe worthy. Then at some point last week I was feeling a bit sad and lonely and looked up some old friends and girlfriends online just to see where people are at in life. When I saw how far everyone had come I sort of just sat there with my jaw half open. It felt like waking up, seeing my ex girlfriend (who is younger than me) graduate from college in pre-Med, holding an internship at some nutrition lab. I was utterly devastated when I realized I had wasted the past years and had become the very thing I feared I would become. A half ass, lazy, stoner with a shitty job and little to show for my life. I turn 24 this Halloween and I have no idea where the years went. I quit tobacco and alcohol as well, but I'm almost through the worst of those withdrawals. 

Just wanted to post here since my friends don't seem to really care all that much. I'm in a pretty fragile state anyway right now, feeling emotional, pissed, then totally numb. It used to be comfortably numb, now its just a limbo I seem to be stuck in. I'm glad the fog is clearing up, and I'm not that bored but the numbness is starting to take its toll. Life has kind of lost its savor. Anyway, thank you all so much your words are wisdom to me. "

Because we lived in different countries (UK and Netherlands) the first few years we had a long distance relationship that involved Skyping each other for hours and hours every single day. It was intense, and whenever we saw each other again it was amazing - even if it was only a few weeks a year. We were deeply in love and had an incredibly deep emotional connection. We practically grew up together. For the both of us, this is our first serious, long-term relationship.

He eventually moved to The Netherlands to live with me when he went to university. The years flew by and things were good. Final parts of his course involved an international internship. He went back to the UK for his placement at an international volunteering place. He fell in love with that place and became really close with the other volunteers there (they live on site). One person in particular that quickly became his best friend.

When his placement came to an end and he came home, he couldn't accept it. It drove him crazy. All he wanted to do was to go back. Before long, he dropped out of uni, stayed with me for a little while, and went back again as a volunteer.

He's an amazing guy. Managed to land himself a paid job with on-site accommodation there that he absolutely loves. We had our future planned out. I'd volunteer there for a couple of months, afterwards we would go onto a world trip with the three of us, and in January I'd move to the UK with him. We were talking about getting engaged soon. Practically picking out the rings.

So the past month we had to spend apart. I had to go back to work (my own company) to prepare for my departure there. Things felt different during this period - he didn't message as much, didn't call, and eventually practically started ignoring my messages. I knew something was up.

I finally managed to talk to him and he started out by saying he ""no longer felt it"". No longer had any romantic feelings for me. He'd been trying but it wasn't there anymore. He admitted he cheated on me, and that he did have feelings for his friend. 

As it turns out, one day before him and his best friend flew out to meet me for this world trip, they cheated on me. They got drunk and it happened. And then, during the week they spent in the Netherlands, they repeatedly cheated on me again. Sober. In my room. On my bed. While I was at work.

They were both extremely sorry for hurting me like that, but he didn't really regret it - it felt new, exciting, an explosion of hormones. A feeling I hadn't given him in a while. As much as I hate to admit it, I can understand it.
 
In the past week we've been trying to talk our way through it. But he's a very ""here and now"" guy, emotions wise. By talking to him, I push him further away, no matter how unfair that is. He insisted that I go on this trip with him. That we'd try to make it work, see if we can get those feelings for each other again. So I agreed. I came with them.
  
It only took a day on this trip before we had a falling out and a conversation in which he said he didn't expect to ever have romantic feelings for me again. We broke up. This was yesterday morning.

He spent the night with his ""friend"" in another room. I've been here alone, barely sleeping. He insists he still wants me on this trip, that I'm still his best friend and he still deeply cares about me. Just... not romantically. Worst thing is, I still love him.

I'm on the other side of the world (US). My boyfriend has left me. My future is in ruins. Everything I had planned, everything I had worked for, is gone. There's nothing left for me to say or do to fix this situation. I feel incredibly powerless, and incredibly alone.

What do I do? Do I go home, and feel terrible there? Do I stay on this trip for another two and a half months, feeling terrible around the world?

I really, really, don't know anymore. It hurts so much.

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Boyfriend of 6 years cheated on me with his best friend. Says he no longer has romantic feelings for me. Now we broke up, and I'm on the other side of the world with them. I still love him, but I've lost him. Future in ruins."

I always had nice things, but you never realized where those nice things came from until i brought you home to my parents. The room where i grew up was larger than your parents entire house. I never appeared spoiled to you, which you loved even more. My parents fell in love with you and told me all the time how this was the guy to marry. We graduated college. My dad bought me a condo and i worked a few days a week at his company. You struggled to find a job and got a small apartment. We finally got engaged and then married. My dad bought us a large home and i immediately set to work hiring a maid and assistant around the house. You protested and I won that argument leaving you never truly happy about it. My dad gave you an executive level position at his company, cementing your place in the family. The money was great, but the days long and grueling.

My spoiled attitude became more apparent, demanding gifts and jewelry regularly. Spending my dads shopping and lunching with my friends. You finally had enough, things were about to change.

You fired the staff and made sure all of the trust deposits went into your account. You sat me down and laid out the new rules:

If i was to be a housewife it meant cooking, cleaning chores. I was to completely obedient to my husband, ask no questions and obey his every command. I was to provide him children and he might only fuck me for that reason. The college interns at work were much tighter with better bodies. if i was good, you might let me watch you fuck them. Disobedience was punished with restraint, spankings and time in the cage. You had a custom cage built under our bed and in the basement, just for that purpose.

I would love to play this out. I am Erica, 28. 

Kinks: Impreg play, cages, spanking, humiliation, restraints, bondage, orgasm control and denial. Essentially the obedient housewife, barefoot and pregnant to serve her husbands every desire or clean the pussy of his latest slut bunny.

Limits: choking, scat, blood, gore, children, incest, animals, watersports, death.

Hope to chat soon!

56ts73,3,2016-10-10,what bullying has done to me,zzziltoid,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/56ts73/what_bullying_has_done_to_me/,"this isn't a post about how i am depressed or suicidal due to bullying.

this is a post 7 years after i graduated high school, 2 years after i graduated college, and 2 years in the working force.

bullying was bad for me in high school. i missed 42 days combined the first two years because of it. I ate alone often. i had shit thrown at me from cars during lunch, had teachers ask me if i am okay, and i even said something once that involved the word ""bomb"" and got suspended out of what i assume as their fear. they knew it was going on. news flash: they don't care. i made few friends, and some people even told me after we graduated they were afraid to befriend me for fear of embarrassment or getting picked on too.

i was picked on until the very day i graduated, on the bus to the ceremony. i don't add 12209102 people on facebook like my friends do, but when i get a request from people from my school , i usually ignore it. i don't know if i can ever forgive them.

i lived in a rural area. i was not made for it. i'm into heavy metal, art, writing, playing on my computer, browsing the internet, and have democratic socialist opinions (opposite to their conservative republican ones). i have glasses and, despite what my bf says, i don't think i'm great looking. (funny thing is a few tried to ask me out after i graduated lol #uglyducking)

but enough about high school because it continued in college. i only made friends in my dorm that didn't actually live there. only people who hung out in the lobby. we eventually stopped talking because i chose to date a guy who was not in their friends group (instead of one who was that was also interested in me). then the bullying happened again as a backlash from my decision. i don't regret it. still together now. love him more than life. (ew ik)

and the worst that happened ever since high school was during my internship. i got my dream internship at a great place, and the 4 other interns all shunned me, fought with me over our project, spread lies, etc. It didn't help that I was 2-3 years older than some of them. It was to the point that my manager could see what was happening, and he had to essentially call them out on it. Talk about embarrassing.

Now I work in a place with a few people my age but mostly older. Honestly, I think for whatever reason I just don't make friends my own age. My closest work friend at the last place was a guy almost 20 years older than me. Same here. I talk a lot with a girl my age, but any time the younger (like 2-3 years younger than me again) people are around, she ignores me. It doesn't really bother me honestly. I don't drink, which creates a huge big line separating us, which is sad but the facts. i don't really fit in her because they are all WASPs and YUPPIES, but i do great work and am actually really outgoing. (i think it's them putting a barrier between us, not them. i like sports and try to talk about it with them but no go.)

Now they are interviewing for interns (maybe 4-3 years younger than me), and the sad thing is my first thought was **""I hope they don't all gang up on me now and pick on me.""** It's pathetic that this is my firs thought. And not all all logical. We don't interact for work because my department is very different from theirs and most of the company, but it's a fear of mine. They don't really pick on me now. I think it's because they are mostly professional, but we have a few work events where I could see it happening. Luckily, at the last one, I had to basically work during it. 

Even though my bullying wasn't to the point where I was committing suicide or cutting or anything dramatic, it is still with me. It is sad. I didn't even realize it was a affected me that much until my therapist point it out. (which i am seeing for unrelated health reasons, another reason they might not pick on me at work because they feel sorry for me)

Anyways, tl;dr bullying sucks and affects you for the rest of your life. therapy helps but whatever"
56tza8,3,2016-10-10,Me [22F] with my close friend [21F] - won't get out of her own way. Not sure how to help her.,askingforafriend288,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/56tza8/me_22f_with_my_close_friend_21f_wont_get_out_of/,"Hi folks, longtime lurker and first time poster. Throwaway and yadda yadda all that good stuff.


My friend (we'll call her S) and I have been close friends since 5th grade. I love and care for her very much. S has suffered from depression for years and had (up until recently) been taking medication/seeing a psych for it. 


So I guess to set things up:


S had moved to a different state last year to get away from her bigoted, narcissistic mom and live her own life. Unfortunately, she couldn't handle working two jobs, one of which was primarily outside in the winter cold. She ran out of her anti-depressants, never had time to see a therapist, and was really overwhelmed with moving to a different apartment in the city, as her previous roommates were being flakey and overall shitty. So she moved back home again to live with her parents a few months back to sort things out and try to relax.

Around the same time I graduated from college, hopped from an internship to a temp job to a full time job and got an apartment with my SO near my work. Life was really busy for the both of us (and still is) so we couldn't see each other as often. 


When we would hang out and catch up, I would ask about life and see how she was. I imagined that it would take her a couple of months to chill out, readjust and start working again. The problem is, S hasn't really done much of anything for around 5-6 months. I get the impression that she mostly sleeps/stays at home almost every day. Every single time we hang (with long periods of time in between hangouts) and I ask if she's contacted a psych/seen a therapist/gotten meds/applied to jobs (whatever) she really doesn't have an answer for me. Or she does, but it's a waffling kind of answer. It's been almost 6 months and she hasn't even looked for/called a therapist - something that would take maybe a half hour at most. I mainly think this is due to her mental illness and I'm starting to worry. Employment and all that stuff aside, S is the type of person that needs medication and/or therapy to help her (which is totally fine, a lot of people need it). Without this basic level of care, she can't seem to pick herself up and continue on with her life. Her ultimate goal is to move out and away from her emotionally abusive mother, but I don't see that happening at this rate. It's kind of a shitty cycle for her right now. Her mom sucks, she lives in that environment, she doesn't feel motivated to get herself out, rinse and repeat. 


I try to make our hangouts as fun as possible to get her out of the house/get her mind off things but I'm also starting to see it as a necessity. I feel like if I don't casually drop in the ""Hey, how's the therapist/job/whatever hunting going?"" every month or so she just completely forgets about it and doesn't make any progress. At the same time, I don't want to come off as a lecturing/judgey friend that constantly badgers her to do things. I try my best to be understanding (I also have mild depression/anxiety that makes things difficult sometimes) but I'm starting to get frustrated and worried. I've offered to help her look for doctors, work on her resume with her - whatever it takes. Unfortunately, she really wants to work on being more independent. I admire this but I don't think it's working out for her. I think she isn't seeing the reality of the situation but I'm not sure how to tell her without hurting her feelings that not doing anything for 5-6 months isn't progress. She needs outside help. I could just look up mental health professionals for her but I feel like that's overstepping boundaries or may be insulting to her.

Any advice?

56u1nf,339,2016-10-10,"My boyfriend [28M] lied on his resume and got hired at the company I [27F] work at, partially based on my recommendation. I'm really conflicted on what to do.",resuliar,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/56u1nf/my_boyfriend_28m_lied_on_his_resume_and_got_hired/,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for 3 years, living together for 1. I also want to say that never in a million years would I think he would do something like this. It is totally out of character for him. 

Anyway, my boyfriend has had a lot of trouble finding work lately. He had an amazing job from pretty much straight out of college up until a year ago, but the company ended up moving to another state and he was let go. This led to a year of really struggling to even be called in for an interview. 

Well, a few weeks ago I heard that there was an opening at my company. The job was tangentially related to what my boyfriend did before, so I told him about it. I also know the hiring manager and am fairly good friends with him, so I put in a good word for my boyfriend (and no, there are no rules against couples/related people working at the company, plus I work in a totally different field.) 

So my boyfriend was hired. That night we had a couple friends over to celebrate. At one point I got up to do something, and when I came back I overheard my boyfriend laughing with his buddy about how he lied on his resume, and that's the reason he got the job. Now, this was pretty alarming to me. My boyfriend has always been a stand-up guy and he knows that my reputation is slightly riding on this, considering I work there and recommended him.

I asked him about it later that night, and he laughed and said I was overreacting, that all he did was leave out his master's degree so he wouldn't be over-qualified. This was a huge relief to me and I dropped it. My boyfriend started working last week. So far everything has been super light, training type stuff, so nothing has happened.

Well, last night I got on his computer to take care of some stuff because I had forgotten my laptop at work. I saw a file for his resume and (maybe this was wrong) curiosity got the better of me and I opened it up. He didn't just lie about his level of education. He lied about knowing a coding language (which isn't even relevant to this job), he lied about how long he was unemployed, he lied about technical skills like typing WPM, knowledge of Office programs, etc. And he also lied about having an internship that is much more closely related to his position now than his previous one. 

I confronted him about it, and he told me that I was freaking out over nothing and if he hadn't lied he wouldn't have gotten the job. He said he was more than qualified and that none of his lies would ever be found out, or have any negative effect on his job or reputation.

Ok, so, I do believe he is capable of doing the job. It's not something you have to have a degree in to know, or be some sort of master at. But I'm also pretty worried because of the nature of some of the lies. For one, he doesn't know how to code. And while I highly doubt that he will ever run in to a situation at work where he will need to, if it's found out, it will be very obvious that it's a lie. Another, bigger concern is the lie about typing skills and knowledge of Office. That's a pretty integral part of his job. I knew he's not super skilled in those areas, but he's not completely inept, either. So I figured that if the company liked him enough, they would overlook that, or do on the job training. But he lied and said he was very skilled. That is *super* easy to uncover. 

I don't know what to do. Part of me wants to stay loyal to my boyfriend and hope for the best. He needs the job, and being unemployed was really, really rough for him. And I do love him and want the best. But I work there, too. And I recommended him. If he's unearthed as a liar and they find out he doesn't know the things he said he did, I'm gonna look really bad, and might even lose my job, too.

What do I do? He wants me to keep quiet, obviously. And part of me does, too. But this whole thing is just really stressing me out and I don't know if keeping it secret would be a horrible mistake.
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My boyfriend lied on his resume and got hired at my company after I recommended him. I don't know if I should keep quiet or tell his bosses what I know. His lies could very easily be found out and have negative consequences. "

*****
&gt; Seems to me they car as much about making this election about the issues as a drunk cares about getting sober!After the Washington Post released a decade-old video of Donald Trump demeaning women, Hillary Clinton pounced.

&gt; She sent a tweet saying, &amp;quot;This is horrific. We cannot allow this man to become president.""

&gt; Hillary not only covered for Bill repeatedly, but she even threatened and silenced his accusers.

&gt; From Gateway Pundit: The Today Show interview with Matt Lauer on January 27, 1998 is famous for Hillary&amp;#039;s claim that a &amp;quot;Vast right-wing conspiracy&amp;quot; was behind the allegations of an affair between her husband President Clinton and White House intern Monica Lewinsky.

&gt; &amp;quot;This is-the great story here for anybody willing to find it and write about it and explain it is this vast right-wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president. A few journalists have kind of caught on to it and explained it. But it has not yet been fully revealed to the American public. And actually, you know, in a bizarre sort of way, this may do it.""

&gt; Later in the interview, Hillary bluntly issued her threat: &amp;quot;I think we&amp;#039;re going to find some other things. And I think that when all of this is put into context, and we really look at the people involved here, look at their motivations and look at their backgrounds, look at their past behavior, some folks are going to have a lot to answer for.""

56u6t4,5,2016-10-10,Relationship seems unimportant to her?,Seaofconfusions,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/56u6t4/relationship_seems_unimportant_to_her/,"So my girlfriend(22) and I(24.5) have been together for about 2.5 years. 
We were seven hours apart at first, then, I moved to an internship in Europe for 6 months(at a super awesome company) - which she supported. Soon I will be moving back (stayed a bit longer here due to unforeseen reasons) but she is super cold as of late.

This happened before I ended the internship, about 3 weeks before. It has been about 1.5 months now.  

I've honestly had way too much free time, since i'm no longer working and get can't wait to get back to the states and actually do stuff, but that doesn't cover it. 

Even if I just send a message or don't message her at all lately, it doesn't really matter. 

Activities we currently do are: Watching tv shows together, sometimes talk about other things going on. When we are talking, sometimes it feels like the old her is back for an hour, or even two, but then it disappears and I don't really hear much from her for a day or two. 

She does have college and part time work, but honestly it feels like she doesn't care anymore and I'm starting not to care anymore.

HOWEVER, we still talk about the future, and I am moving back to the states soon (staying at a friends) and then within those two months, the plan is to find housing near her. She is sending me links to apartments that would be good and in general helping so I can move back to her.  And we talk about future stuff even further down(she wants the proposal to be in 3 years, she would want her wedding to be this way, these are the types of things we'd do when we move back etc. ) This is the most confusing part for me, and if we didn't talk about the future, I would have probably made up my mind to end it the next time I see her. 

I brought it up to her about two weeks ago, I wrote nicely that I felt we were drifting apart which we made a promise to let each other know(at the beginning of the relationship), so we can fix it. She kind of shot me down and claimed ""nothing had really changed, it's probably just you."" 

Basically what I think is happening is:

A. She found someone else she's interested in, and is keeping me as a back up. She is a tomboy, so the majority of people she hangs out with are male(this was never a problem though, until, maybe recently). 
B. She's depressed
C. I'm depressed/Both depressed(i was always a little depressed when I wasn't with her, it is not easy of course)
D. (I used to think this was an option, so I'll list it): I have too much free time at the moment, so I think it's different then before
----even if I give her a day, or space, it doesn't change anything. 

Should I call it quits when I get back to the states(right now it's a rollercoaster of emotions, mostly negative ones...)? 

Should I visit her, and if during the visit, everything is good again, just think of this as a once and done type of deal? 

If it does work out again, should I be concerned of things like this happening again in the future?

Looking forward to some insightful help.

Thanks :)

Edit/Update: 

Thanks for all the helpful advice. I think definitely part of it, is anxiety on my part, but we also hang out a lot less. She is pretty busy. I will see how it goes when i visit her. If it continues in this negative pattern, I will break it off with her. It will suck because we have a lot of mutual friends, but honestly, it's so draining at the moment. I can't be a bastion of perserverance forever. 
However,
I am optimistic that things will end up positive. I am leaning towards that this is just an awkard phase in our lives and our previous relationship will be rekindled soon.  I will update you guys in a couple weeks.

56ua37,1,2016-10-10,20M4F - My Mom's Friend (and Maybe My Mom Too!),bladesofsteel21,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/56ua37/20m4f_my_moms_friend_and_maybe_my_mom_too/,"I'm home from school for the summer and the days are dragging. I'm about to enter my senior year of college and my internship is nearly half over already. It has been several weeks of the nine-to-five and I can't believe I'm saying this, but I want the summer to end. Being an only child, I was always given a lot of attention from my loving mom. I did my best to make my dad proud, but it never seemed to be enough. With his constant travelling for work, he wasn't there to see me play youth sports and was only proud when I brought home a trophy...mainly so he had something to display next to his self-made wall of fame.

You...you are my mom's best friend and neighbor and the woman I first ever fantasized about when I first discovered the joys of masturbation. You have a loving husband but over the years, something has been missing in your life. You simply don't know what yet. You and my mom both don't have to work as your husbands bring in more than enough to support the families. You often find yourself lounging around our pool with my mom.

It's Friday around 3 PM. I got off work early and couldn't wait to come home. The truth is I knew you would be over and I could get a glimpse of you in a bikini as you lay out. It's nearly 90 degrees and I cannot wait to jump in the pool. I throw on some trunks and head out to the pool and find [you and my mom reading gossip websites on your tablets](http://cache2.asset-cache.net/gc/178966602-two-women-using-ipads-by-the-pool-gettyimages.jpg?v=1&amp;c=IWSAsset&amp;k=2&amp;d=EJohqlxhEoMaBN8er34Ev9POnDFgP6zdgsSFBcHKlS3lYW1bQxEjCVEV7u%2FWN6je). We make small talk and my mom excuses herself to go inside for a moment. 

The conversation between you and I continues and we get a little personal. I tell you I am not seeing anyone and you tell me your husband is away on business so you're staying alone. You tell me that you often get scared staying alone and you were thinking about staying at our house for the night since my dad is away on business as well. Soon after my mom comes out and you quickly change the subject. You and my mom excuse yourselves after and I continue to swim alone. I begin think to myself ""was she just trying to tell me something?""  

I swim for a little longer then get on a float and begin to daydream as I cannot get the image of you in your bikini out of my head. I start to wonder just what it is you two are doing inside the house and my fantasy begins to include my mom. I envision the two of you in her room slowly pulling your bikinis off as you lay next to each other and are making out. I begin to doze off and wake up sometime later. The sun is still out but it is time I head back in to the house. I grab my towel and head for the back door...
______________________________________
I will let you decide what happens from there. Do I walk in on you and my mom going at it? Do you go back home and invite me over? Do you spend the night and find a way to sneak to my room/somewhere else in the house? Do we include my mom as well? (if you cannot tell, a kink of mine is definitely incest). We could both play the role of her and direct her based on whose turn it is. You can determine your age in the RP, add more back story to your character, and make any other changes you like.
___________________________________________
I'm pretty open sexually. Some of my other kinks include being dominant, anal, light bondage, deep throat, threesomes, public sex, and age play (18+ only). But I'm open to any and all suggestions. I am looking for long term RP for this. "
56uc8j,1,2016-10-10,F4A - The Dark Journey To Fame,Undisclosed_Desires7,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/56uc8j/f4a_the_dark_journey_to_fame/,"

Katheyn or what she preferred to be called Katy was the new intern at the company. A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused.

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

-----------

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

The prompt above doesn't have to be the start or involved in it... just an example of some writing.

Can be different and have a male celebrity and their journey. (Check out my 'Famous Life' posting in my post history for that)

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Megan Fox, Margot Robbie, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba. Though.. the female celebrity can be an original character that is made up would love her to look like Madison Ivy or Lana Rhoades though also into Lindsey Pelas, Emily Sears and Claudia Alende.

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

P.S Also have a recent posting in which I mention all the rp's and things I'm interested in for a long term rp, so check that out if you want, particularly interested in doing a Marvel Black Widow RP or a Post apocalyptic/dystopia world that is similar to Fallout or a Bioshock rp. Also a Walking Dead rp.

56ui8e,85,2016-10-10,"Daybreak, you've lost me.",DOrr94,h1z1,https://www.reddit.com/r/h1z1/comments/56ui8e/daybreak_youve_lost_me/,"I've been playing H1 since it launched, and I've always given you guys the benefit of the doubt. I know, deep down, you wish to make a game that is truly fun and enjoyable- but it isn't the game so many of us bought early access to. 

Don't get me wrong- I refuse to agree with a majority of the people on this sub who have never written a line of code in their life, much less developed a game on a home-made engine. However, I can't give you guys the benefit of the doubt with the way things are going. 

I understand your parent company owns your every move- from the profiteering to the publicity stunts like giving priority access to larger streamers at twitchcon, so I don't blame the developers. I blame the process.

Your development process is backwards. You guys shell out needless updates, features, and bells/whistles before properly addressing what is already in the game. 

I'll give you an example: Instead of fixing the issues involving Z1, you spend months creating a brand new map. I love Z2, but Z1 was fine for fixing the gameplay. It worked, it was relatively lagless on mid-tiered rigs, and it was okay for game testing. Creating a new map with all of the bells and whistles Z2 has came at a time that it wasn't needed, or warranted. Creating a new ""box of destiny"" with a racetrack, for instance, is one of the cases of making icing before the cake is baked. 

Your process should be to iron out gameplay issues BEFORE adding new content/features. If I'm making a website/software and I add a button, but when I press the button it does not work as intended, I don't add more buttons that depend on that button. I fix the issue. You added a weapon blocking system for anti-clipping, which is a great idea, but it isn't implemented properly and in turn is causing many deaths that are unjust.

In addition, you guys add features (or hint at them), and back out of them without warning. Ping lock? Katana? Spectator mode? 

You guys emphasize esports, which inherently implies a fair and balanced playing field, on a game that is as RNG-dependent and as inconsistent as playing roulette in Vegas. Shotguns don't work consistently, bullets disappear, hitboxes are funky, and vehicle collision is broken. Again, I'm not calling you bad programmers/game devs as I know what it is like to fix one error and have 10 more pop up, but it all goes back to the process of prioritization. 

If I were in control of H1's development, I'd put these things in order:

1. Fix server issues with stuttering/lagging players. Hopefully this fixes bullets not working/grenades not doing damage/vehicle collision. 

2. Optimize the map for maximum performance, fix memory leaks.

3. Start working on current gameplay fixes. Adjust shotgun, grenades, spawns, etc.

4. Sweep through and make sure all of the above are complete, the game is lag free, consistent, and fun.

5. NOW add new content. Repeat steps 1-4 when needed, always before adding new stuff.

Finally, I've offered countless ideas for you guys, bug reports, etc.- and I feel mostly ignored. That's the main issue above all else. You guys claim to want to be transparent, but never talk about anything. Here's a tip: It is more satisfying, as a customer and alpha tester, for a company to admit failure than to try and hide it through silence/vague language. The community would be much more accepting if you'd actually say ""hey guys, this is messed up, here's why:"" instead of radio silence. I won't reference any other games/early access programs, but you and I know which names people would bring up.

I want H1Z1 (I refuse to drop that title, as much as you guys are looking to) to be great. I love the game's concept, and I refuse to let it fail silently. My offer to come intern for you guys is still very much on the table, I'd love to help in any way possible (even volunteering if it meant I could work on the game). 

Regards

Edit: I should mention that this is in regards to both games, not just one half. In addition, ""you've lost me"" is more of a confusion-based statement, not another ""lol I'm quitting!!1!"" post."
56upax,0,2016-10-10,"Hillary admits to ""rubbing against"" young male interns",mentaljewelry,Conservative,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/56upax/hillary_admits_to_rubbing_against_young_male/,"Top aides of democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton confessed anonymously to Washington Post columnist C. Mike Hunt today that they heard the former Secretary admit to deliberately ""rubbing"" herself ""up against"" young male interns and even to ""lightly pinching"" the ends of their penises on occasion. 

""She said she walked right up to one new guy and whispered stuff to him before sliding her hand down and squeezing the end of his dick through his pants,"" one source said. ""She said it was done playfully and she was just horsing around, trying to get to know her staff.""

According to another source, ""She said she gets away with stuff like that because she's so smart and powerful. I mean, what are they going to do? Freak out in front of everyone?""

The female source went on to say, ""She was talking to us in the dressing room while getting ready for an ABC interview in 2004. We all had wine because a toast had just been offered in the green room. I don't know why she thought it was OK to gossip about it, but I guess it's just the way girls talk when their hair is in curlers, you know?""

A male staffer of former president Bill Clinton said he was once kissed on the lips by the former Secretary in a maintenance closet in the White House. ""Yeah, she just opened the door and motioned me in while I was standing there sorting mail. When I stepped inside, it was dark and she started licking my lips and trying to put her tongue inside my mouth. I didn't want to continue but I didn't know how to push her away. The press was right outside.""

Pundits and representatives throughout the Democratic Party were quick to dismiss the seriousness of the accusations. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont said in an interview with USA Today, ""There are far worse situations facing the nation than whether Clinton did or did not admit to groping some fan boys. The last thing this country needs is another Republican president.""

When pressed to offer an opinion as to whether he personally thought Ms. Clinton had inappropriately touched unwilling male staffers, Sanders said, ""Let me just say this. If she did, she did. It's a long time ago, and Trump has done much worse. They were probably throwing themselves at her anyway. Many people are saying they  unzipped their flies and waggled their cocks at her. I'm not saying it, but others are.""

As a reminder, Ms. Clinton has previously called men ""boring drones,"" ""testosterone zombies,"" ""pencil pricks,"" and ""little more than whiny children."" Mr. Trump states that due to her anti-masculine bias, Clinton is unfit to govern the delicate male half of the population."

now I`ve got a Reddit account and everything, even though you guys are all nerds and poor and stuff......

Anyhow, it`s about my cultural studies course ok?-I mean my majors in economics, but mummy says I've 'gotta do Cultural Studies, 'cos Wallstreet's like, all PC now and everything....I mean you can't just use a Motorola 8000 on the interns, now, `cos phones aren't that big anymore!.

But, like anyway, there's this paper in  Jen...Gen...*What are Boys and Girls*,and the prof says I 'gotta do it all on *The Girl Inside*, 'cos I'm transgender!. I mean, isn't that like, some kind of m-i-n-o-r-i-t-y or something?-don't get me wrong guys, minorities are cool, and mummy says were a minority just 'cos we're rich-I mean the Teasparty's not cool, but i'ts not like taxidermy`s ok either (mummy says there's this one guy on the Supreme Court that's got a hobo stuffed down in his basement-I mean, you know Republicans guys!).

But it's like, now I 'gotta right about this girl....I mean we've all got one trapped inside us right?.Well I said, *she's 'gotta be a small one to fit in there*, but, like whatever.

And then theres this whole sex thing, ok, I mean being gays is cool, except it's a bit, like gay right?.And I'm thinking,if Im a girl, and I like guys, then that makes me gay right?, but then if I like girls who are like boys, then I'm not gay, but if I'm a boy,then I like, am?-it's all making the air between my ears hurt!.

So then I said to mummy that Im maybe bisexual, and she said that if your rich you can buy any damn sex you like, and I'm not Polysexual, 'cos she says only te Brits have Polys, and anyhow that's where the dummies go.

But then when I like, said I didn't have this girl in me at-all some ghetto skanks on the net said that they were going to make me eat my dick, skin me alive,and then make me watch all of Rupaul's Dragrace, untill mumy found out where they lived and they stopped (and there was this one guy on a scholarship that called me a cissy, but mummy had the guys bust his jaw,but know its wired up, and he has to drink through a straw, but she says its cos hes on welfare, and it's congresses fault for fucking up Obamacare). 

So, like help me guys what am I !-I don't give  fuck, but mummy says she knows someone on the Joint Chiefs, so if I graduate, I can fly a real-live drone in Syria, and if I get honours they'll let me draw a picture of the prophet on it......and it will be like *fuck you, you transfo....tranny hating towel-heads!*.

So anyway, I think I can just be a boy with tits if I want, 'cos if not, then that's like, discrimination too, so *fuck you trans community!*.

I mean, it's the largest law firm in the city. And with that territory, comes a flurry of interns, both law students and undergrads. Some are preppy frat boys whose daddies are old buddies with the senior partners. Some are college girls with tight, sexy bodies, but you can’t seem to get past the shrill laughter that makes your skin crawl.

So lots slip in between the cracks. And for awhile, I did, too. But one day, a fellow senior partner made a crack to you. He mentioned how stressed he was, and made a crude reference to a few things he wanted a certain intern to do. Apparently she arranged a few things for a trial, and she was surprisingly competent, a rarity, even in this prestigious office.

And umf. Her body. But it was something else that drove his mind over the edge and into the gutter.

""She's the one with the lipstick,"" he mentions.

Its late one night, and it feels like all the senior partners are heading into trials or big negotiations. All of the interns are required to work — whether it be fetching coffee or redacting credit card numbers in trial notebooks.

You saunter into the break room to grab a fresh cup of coffee. You open the door softly, and I’m the only person in the room. Your eyes land directly on my ass. Curvy, and accented by a pencil skirt. My waist is narrow, and I can’t seem to reach the plate from the top shelf, even in my heels. My long dark hair is curled bouncing as I stretch. With an exhale of frustration I turn around, and you see a young intern, probably 21, with bright green eyes that widen as I notice you. 

And then you notice the lipstick.

In my freshman year of high school I was overwhelmed with stress and as a result my grades suffered pretty harshly and made me even more depressed. I never felt motivated to do anything, and felt almost no emotion at all. For some reason though, I though that some time in the future, everything would be a lot better and what I was doing at the moment didn't matter too much. A year later, I motivated myself to actually give a shit about school, and my grades improved drastically and I ended up graduating in the top 10% of my class. I started university and kept the same routine. I cared so much about school that it was the only thing important for me. While other peers were working on side projects, and getting internships, I studied and as a result I didn't make too many friend. I ended my freshman year with a 4.0 and am currently in my sophomore year, and it is giving me a lot of stress. I feel as though if I get anything less than a A on any assignment, I will lose the 4.0 and I will be a failure and this has given me a lot of stress.

(hair loss + gynecosmatia)
 Sometime during my sophomore year, I began to diffusely go bald. I went to several doctors and all of them said that there was pretty much nothing I could do besides go on rogaine so I started using that. My hair loss caused me an immense amount of stress and as a result developed some social anxiety. It was hard for me to go to pool parties, or worry about the direction of the wind, because all of that affected the position of my hair, would ruin the position I had set it in to hide the fact that I was balding. I got a lot of shit from people as a result, and for the most part I tried to play it off nicely, but in reality it affected me a lot. During my freshman year, I started using propecia, and It made my hair feel a bit fuller and thicker. I was happy with the results, but not with the side affect. I felt dull everyday, there was no sex drive, and I eventually grew some breast tissue. The breast tissue now was my main source of anxiety, I would worry stupid shit like how different shirts would portray my nipples, or how cold it is outside, or how to go swimming without my nipples being puffy. I eventually decided that it was better not taking propecia and stopped. My hair is now in a worse state that it was before and I still have breast tissue under my nipples. There are now two things I worry about everyday on top of the other things I worry about.

(internships)
A bunch of people I know got internships as a freshman. I used the summer of my freshman year to set myself up for success. I worked on a lot of projects to make my resume outstanding, and applied to around 50 companies. I heard back from a bunch and eventually got interviews. The first couple interviews I thought went pretty well, but in the end they decided to cut me. I was really hoping that these companies would like me given that the interviews were so easy, yet I wasn't good enough for them. I have a couple more interviews coming up and I am extremely stressed about them. I feel as though if I don't do perfectly on these interviews, I will end up in my parent's house for the rest of my life looking for a job.

(university)
University I thought was going to be the best time of my life but instead it turned out to be going pretty poorly. It seems that every relationship i've had so far has only ever reached the status of a friendly acquaintance. Its not that I've never put myself out there. I've attended several frat rush events, several organizations, and still haven't really found a person I can really connect with or a niche for me. As a result I spend most of my time alone, and the loneliness causes me stress. My classes are almost always filled with really smart people and they always seem to brag about some accomplishment, and it makes me feel like a fucking dumb ass and this causes me stress.

(breaking point)
I recently visited home on a whim and tried to distance myself from my family and friends, so I can get used to their absence. The thought that I will see them less and less in the future and the more I will be on my own gives me stress. When I was driving back to university I broke down and cried for about 40 min straight. At the moment there was nothing I was crying about, but it just felt natural. I cried so intensely that I almost crashed my car. The next day I felt a little better initially, but then, sometime mid-day I broke down and started having panic attacks. I was hyperventilating, It was hard for me to breathe, tears started to form, and my muscles were all tense. At this point I don't really know what to do but I thought that If I wrote the all out and talked to somebody about it, it might feel a little better... and so far I feel a little better.

EDIT: sorry for the poor writing, I am not a writer, english is not my first language, I am actually Vietnamese."

56wkw2,13,2016-10-11,Am I being promoted too soon? (Construction Management),honeyonarazor,Construction,https://www.reddit.com/r/Construction/comments/56wkw2/am_i_being_promoted_too_soon_construction/,"I posted this in r/jobs but figured it wouldn't hurt to post here as well.

I'm in my second year of college, taking 13.5 credits this semester and studying construction management. I was hired on with a construction company 7 months ago as a summer intern expected to work 30 hours a week. Everything was going great.

Then the operations manager for our Hawaii division put her two weeks in about a month ago. They had nobody to fill the position so my boss said I will take over Hawaii operations temporarily until they can find somebody to fill the spot. So she trained me to the best of her ability (not very well) for 2 weeks and I've been doing operations since then - 1 month total of operations experience.

Since then, the lead estimator for Hawaii put his two weeks in and he trained me to the best of his ability while I was trying to figure out how to run operations. Boss told me this is also temporary as he is reviewing resumes for an estimator or office engineer to help me out.

I have come to learn the previous Hawaii operations manager had no clue what she was doing, probably because she was so overworked. She would routinely work 10-12 hour days. So on top of all this new responsibility I am trying to clean up the mess she made. We have jobs over the allotted working days so my company is being charged liquidated damages everyday. One is $5000 a day, the other is $3,000 a day. So between those two, the company is losing $8,000 a day. The lead estimator was dealing with all the litigation involved so now I might have to deal with that as well?

So basically I have no clue what I'm doing in this position. I feel like I've been set up to fail. I'm getting waaaay behind in school and now have been taking days off to catch up. As well as trying to do homework on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights even though that rarely works out because I am so stressed out from this job. I've started to lose a lot sleep over this job, increasing my stress level even more.

I have made it very clear to the owner and his wife that I can't be doing this job and going to school full time. They say it's temporary but their actions speak otherwise. I really don't know how to get through to them besides giving them an ultimatum. Maybe hire somebody who isn't going to school full time and have them take on all this responsibility and I will help with whatever I can.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

56wpkp,45,2016-10-11,[Race Report] Chicago Marathon: First Marathon &amp; Somewhat Unprepared,NowICanComment,running,https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/56wpkp/race_report_chicago_marathon_first_marathon/,"Hi /r/running. I [posted here some time ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/540l7a/chicago_coming_up_in_a_few_weeks_just_getting/) wondering if I should even run Chicago since my training had dropped off so much. Well, if you hadn't figured out from the title, I did it!

**Goal:** Finish the race before the time deadline. That was it. No goal time or anything.

**Training:**
I got back into running after high school last summer. Since last summer, I had been solidly running 3-4 miles about 5 times a week so I had some base running/cardio covered. Followed my training plan through the [University of Iowa Dance Marathon](https://dancemarathon.uiowa.edu/) program which began around late March for me. I worked my way up through the summer to 16ish miles in mid-August. Then school started.....and my training tanked. All time to run had to be given to homework and the internship search. On top of that I got sick (and still am - 6 weeks later). I ran 3-4 times a week with shorter runs about 5 miles and struggled to find the time and energy for long runs on the weekend - they were about 7 or 8 miles max. At the peak of midterms/sickness/deadlines I was terrified that I wouldn't be able to run the race.

**Day before:** Freaking out that I hadn't truly run in 2 weeks. Got my things from the expo and was intimidated by all of the gear around me and serious runners talking about their goals. *She just bought compression socks...is that something I should have? I've never had a PowerBar...will I need that? Why the heck will I need Dude Wipes? There's pills for sleeping before the race? Why are they getting salt packets?* Safe to say I thought I was screwed.

**Morning of:** 4:15am came way too fast for me. I hardly slept due to my typical 2am bedtime in college. I got up, showered, had a banana, and went off to the meeting point to have more breakfast and prep with all of the other Dance Marathon runners. We wrote FTK on our arms in Sharpie (""for the kids""), put tattoos on our arms of names of the kiddos fighting cancer who we were running for, [took some photos](http://i.imgur.com/2XeeV1E.jpg), and had an awesome pump up speech from our coaching chairs. I was feeling a lot better about the race and knew I had to do it for the kids fighting cancer. We left the conference room pumped up and went down to the corrals to start the race. I knew my corral was much faster than my actual pace but I wanted that time buffer!

**Race time - 1 to 3:** It took awhile to get past the [start line](http://i.imgur.com/OcPm9IW.jpg) since we were in corral H but we finally got there. My friend and I made a promise to each other that we'd stay together and not let the other stop. We started at what felt like a glacial pace compared to everyone else but that ended up being important later. We stopped for a bathroom break early on too - we both drank so much water that morning and really had to pee!! I didn't stop for a bathroom break at all for the rest of race.

[At mile 2 I saw my family](http://i.imgur.com/ab6mFAc.jpg) and gave my parents hugs. Around mile 3 I saw my roommate and other Dance Marathon people and gave them hugs too.

Holy shit. I was really running THE Chicago Marathon.

**4-9:** Feeling great. Not tired at all, muscles feeling good, enjoying the atmosphere. There's nothing quite like running for hours on end and having people cheering for you the whole time. I had my name on my jersey so I had quite a few personal cheers. The people of Chicago really know how to make their signs too! They were hilarious. I was having a blast. I stopped for every Gatorade and water stop there was. My friend and I were talking and meeting people on the course who pointed out our jerseys and asked about our cause. He was starting to lag a bit for my taste but I slowed down with him because I made a promise. I was having a blast taking in the neighborhood, crowd, and performances so I didn't mind too much. [I saw my parents again and got a goofy photo where I was doing who knows what](http://i.imgur.com/CyQrj9Q.jpg). My parents aren't the softy type but hearing them tell me they were proud of me gave me more energy. 

**10-13.1:** My friend had slowed so much to the point of walking and I couldn't do that to myself. I knew if I stopped to walk, I'd never get running again. So I pushed on (and had some shot bloks). Still felt amazing - no pain, not breathing heavy, meeting people on the course, and smiling and laughing from the crowd. People were handing out fruit and tissues and in some places, beer. I only grabbed a banana and some tissues (thank you for people who hand out tissues!!).

**13.1-16:** I did it. I ran a half marathon already and felt AWESOME. I was back downtown, people were cheering me on, and I was having a blast. I made it halfway and felt nothing - I might actually be able to finish this!!

Mile 14 was the charity mile. I saw more Dance Marathon people and more importantly -- I saw the coaching chairs. Their love for Dance Marathon and running lit a fire inside of me. They would've given anything to be out there running too but instead they gave up even MORE time to train all 219 of us DM runners through our questions, struggles, and successes. Seeing them so happy made me grin like an idiot for the next 3 miles I swear. [I saw my parents at 16](http://i.imgur.com/skYusM6.jpg) and once again they told me they were so proud of me. I had no idea I'd need that motivation boost so much in the next 5 miles.

**17-19:** I put in my headphones here. Starting to lose the fun part and needed some focus. I hadn't walked yet but at mile 18 I slowed down to a walk/jog that was probably really funny to watch. It was starting to hurt. My feet were feeling heavier than they did a few miles ago. Start to feel a little tightness in my quads. Oh no.

**20-23:** PROBABLY THE HARDEST THING I'VE EVER DONE. I had blisters. My legs felt like sand bags. I wanted to throw up (never drinking yellow gatorade again). I was cramping in muscles I didn't even know I had. I stopped to stretch/shake out some. Getting started again was even harder. I cried a little bit. I just wanted to be done. The sun was out more, I was wearing black, I was sunburnt. I felt defeated and honestly considered quitting. I texted my friends that I was struggling and they sent back encouraging messages but it didn't feel like enough. But I looked at my arm and remembered the kids in the hospital back at home who feel like that every single day as chemo is being pumped through their body and they're poked with needles. They don't have the option to quit and neither did I. So I walked. Ran a few steps, then walked. Rinse and repeat for 3 miles.

**24-26:** At mile 24, the crowd was beginning to pick up again. It was a happier atmosphere. I saw a man holding a sign that said *""From this point, you only have a 5k left.""* I needed that. I've ran plenty of 5k's in my training. They take no time at all. That's easy stuff. I picked up the pace a little. I was running more than I was walking instead of the other way around. I turned the corner to the street that was the last stretch back downtown. People were yelling my name. My legs were getting used to moving at a running pace again. My legs were heavy and my feet hurt, but they hurt less when I was running. By 25.5ish, I was feeling good again. Back at regular pace. Drinking the rest of my water. Thinking of the kids in the hospital who were rooting me on in the pediatric unit. In a motivational video DM made, one boy said ""if I can beat cancer then you can RUN.""

**0.2:** I saw my parents one last time before I turned and ran the final 800m. I've never seen my dad so happy! They were jumping up and down and [taking pictures of me](http://i.imgur.com/IKn2fby.jpg). I was so close. My legs were totally numb. I found a few other girls in DM and ran with them that last 800m with everything I had. [The finish line was in front of me](http://i.imgur.com/DjslhY8.jpg) and holy shit I did it. [I ran a marathon](http://i.imgur.com/Kqi2fuK.jpg).

I finished in 5:35:07. Not bad for the training plan I followed if I do say so myself! I [raised my money for charity](https://osl.iowa.uiowa.edu/dancemarathon/donate/8/15753), I ran the marathon after a rocky end-of-training, I met some amazing people along the way, and overall I felt great during the race. I don't think I'll do it again next year because training with school/job hunt (hire me pls) is nearly impossible *however* [I definitely see myself returning to the Chicago marathon in the future](http://i.imgur.com/1g6wqlE.jpg)."

56x9gd,2,2016-10-11,One day out of Surgery! Noa Clinic Review so far,Abletablemaple,gynecomastia,https://www.reddit.com/r/gynecomastia/comments/56x9gd/one_day_out_of_surgery_noa_clinic_review_so_far/,"Alright, so I've been waiting a while to write this post. I just got discharged from Noa Clinic which is in Wroclaw, Poland. I'm from the US and saw multiple posts from happy folks that went to Noa both on reddit and some random other sites. I originally wanted to come to Poland a couple years ago but thought I would rather save up and spend the money on Dr. Blau. After a couple price hikes by him, it became clear that I wouldn't be able to afford him until I get my real job. So I went ahead and rediscovered Noa from a couple posters here on reddit and booked it for myself and tried to keep this as under wraps as possible (Hah). I went ahead and let my dad know, just in case something horrific happened, but for the most part let nobody know.

Just like most other gyne posters, I didn't ever really take off my shirt and had to hide it under clothes. Unlike some posters though, I didn't let the gyne keep me from getting girls or get me into depression. It was embarrassing and it sucked, but I didn't let it ruin my life. I think it helps to also realize this surgery will probably not make your chest perfect, your chest doesn't define who you are, but will help your self esteem enough to add on top of whatever you already value in yourself. So yeah, after my internship this summer, I booked noa, let my professors know I'll be gone for a week and here I am. If you want to know more about the city and a much more detailed review /u/gynoguy has a great write up. You can also google 'noa clinic gynecomastia' and there's a dude from gynecomastia.org that made a killer review.

As for me. I came in, got picked up by Chris. Booked a hotel room at Solo Plus which is actually really nice. Poland is a lot more modern than I expected, but the weather here is as depressing as I imagined it would be. The clinic itself is nice and clean. First thing they do is get you to sign a bunch of forms, mainly the ones declaring that you are mentally fit for this and anesthesiology forms. You are gonna talk to a psychiatrist (I guess, I have no idea) and she will judge you by the answers you give on the form earlier. Afterwards you get your blood drawn, then they tell you to take a shower, get dressed in that patient gown and slippers, then wait on the bed for the surgery. I got in at 8 AM and was supposed to have surgery at 12. They ended up doing it an hour earlier. Now let me say, I'm not one to freak out and I think I kept my cool for the most part, but when they strapped me onto the table sticking needles and wires all around without speaking a lick of english, I realized that I had no idea how to gauge this situation and thought maybe I made a mistake. Luckily the anesthesiologist noticed and said everything will be alright and put the gas mask on me. Literally in 3 breaths I was knocked out. Next thing I know I'm getting helped in the bed, then I wake up hours later. There will be a nurse (Nicest lady in the world) who will come by with life saving sandwiches. She will come by throughout the day and night to change your bandages until you get checked the next morning.  

I didn't know who was actually doing my surgery since I've been switched around multiple times through email and in person. At first I thought it was going to be Wojciech Berendt, who I heard about from the other poster. Instead I got Adam, the main surgeon. I didn't really mind since a good portion of posters got him, so it wasn't a big deal. When I woke up after the surgery, I noticed my left nip was bigger than my right. I was so messed up that I went to sleep and didn't think of it. By the next morning when my chest was getting rewrapped by the nurse, she noticed how much more swollen the left was compared to my right. She didn't freak out per se, but there was concern in her face, especially when she felt it and realized I was in pain. Adam comes by later on and says not to worry, it's just swollen. I know I should believe the doctor, but I tend to believe the nurses since they see a lot more and interact with patients much more than the doctor usually does. I asked him what's the chances it's not just swollen and he says it's 0% or I would be under the knife again. His confidence is rock solid, unfortunately mine is a little shaken. Regardless, he's going to check up on me tomorrow and we'll see what's up. I'm a little bummed out this happened but I'm sure it'll work out. I'll keep updating this post each week with my progress up to 4 weeks, then do two more posts separated by two weeks. Those updated posts were life savers when coming to a decision about Noa. Regardless though, the customer service, cleanliness, and price made Noa clinic worth it to me, I just hope the results work out.

If you have any questions let me know. I'll probably try to make this much more coherent at some other point because I feel like this post is more of a stream of consciousness than anything, hahaha. Sorry about that peeps!"
56xfdd,3,2016-10-11,IT Fortbildungen,quineloe,DEjobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DEjobs/comments/56xfdd/it_fortbildungen/,"Hallo zusammen,

Ich hätte gerne ein bisschen Feedback zu meiner derzeitigen Situation. Ich bin 34, habe im Februar 2011 den Informatikkaufmann abgeschlossen und bin danach zu einer Zeitarbeit, bei der ich bis Oktober 2015 bei einem großen internationalen IT Dienstleister eingesetzt wurde. Dort habe ich 7x24 Schicht gemacht, First level support und noch ein bisschen mehr, jedoch keine weiteren Qualifkationen erworben, von einer zweitätigigen Schulung zu Windows 8.1 und Office 2013 ohne Prüfung abgesehen, und ein paar billiger self-e-learning Dinger, die die Firma intern zusammengerotzt hat. Themen Datenschutz, Compliance und so was halt. 

Im Oktober 2015 bin ich dann in eine direkte Festanstellung gewechselt, Schwerpunkt war hier Anwendungssupport, ein bisschen SQL, ein bisschen Allerleiarbeiten wie Barcode-Karten erstellen und verschicken für die Mitarbeiter. Das endete aber am Ende der Probezeit, seit mitte April bin ich also jobsuchend.

Und das auch relativ erfolglos. Es waren zwar viele Vorstellungsgespräche dabei, häufig für Stellen die auch ""besser"" gewesen wären als meine letzten, aber die wurden dann alle nicht von mir besetzt. Auch auf typische Service Desk stellen habe ich mich wieder beworben, aber gerade bei denen kam es nicht mal zum Vorstellungsgespräch. 

Habe auch bei XING Zeug reingestellt, da kam es auch zu einem Vermittlungsversuch über eine Agentur und Vorstellungsgespräch, da kam letzte Woche dann aber auch eine Absage. 

War auch wieder bei Zeitarbeitsfirmen, auch die stellen mich dann immer 2-3 Kunden vor, und dann Absage und dann kommt von denen nichts mehr.

Ich verstehe nicht, warum mich keiner im Service Desk haben will. Ich hab da fünf Jahre Erfahrung, bei Dutzenden von verschiedenen Kunden. Nicht mal  Vorstellungsgespräche sind da drin. Meine Unterlagen sind hoffentlich 1A, habe sie bereits von mehreren Experten für den Unsinn durchsehen lassen. 

Jetzt hat sich aber etwas neues ergeben. Ich habe im Arbeitsamt mehrmals gesagt, ich will mich weiterbilden. Da wurde erst geblockt, weil ich ja eigentlich sofort nen Job finden sollte. Dann hab ich's nach ein paar Monaten wieder angeleiert. Dann sollte ich die Nachfrage belegen, hab also ein halbes Dutzend Stellenangebote zusammengesucht, die entsprechenden Anforderungen markiert und meiner Beraterin übergeben. Ein Monat später (letzten Freitag) wieder Termin dort, sie bewilligt mir folgendes Paket:

* 3 Monate MCSA Windows Server 2012
* 3 Monate IT Security, Router Switches config, Mail u Webserver einrichten, Firewalls implementieren, VPN, WLAN, Netzwerkanalyse mit Herstellerzertifikat zb CCNA
* 1-2 Monate Betriebspraktikum

Da bin ich noch mal fast ein Jahr auf ALG1. Aber wenn ich mich nicht irre, müsste ich mit diesen Fortbildungen dann doch unendlich viel besser dastehen als das jetzt der Fall ist? 

Was meint ihr, soll ich die Jobsuche jetzt sausen lassen und unbedingt dieses Fortbildungspaket kassieren? Ich würde mich ja gerne weiter in einer Firma hocharbeiten, aber bei der letzten war ich halt bei Einstellung schon an der Glass Ceiling festgehangen (Zeitarbeiter...) und wenn ich wieder nur so was finde komme ich die nächsten fünf Jahre auch nicht weiter.

Danke schonmal dass ihr das alles gelesen habt."

He looks around in a fit of range before turning towards [the young intern](http://moviecitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Fat-Kid-Rules-the-World_04.jpg) he tortured in his promo.

**Dutch:** HEY YOU!

[The intern turns around in shock](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ecc84ef815dc7eb4e6870c4047a66578/tumblr_inline_o29fpn0dEb1txctzy_500.gif) and immediately bolts away, running as he holds his [Best Intern Ever](http://www.laneterralever.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/internship-image.jpeg) mug, half glued back except for the small fragments he misses. Dutch follows after him, sprinting and catching up easily before [tackling him](https://usatthebiglead.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/clay-matthews-hit-on-colin-kaepernick.gif), the mug going down to the floor and the intern sits there, staring at his formerly broken and now fixed mug smashed back on the floor in even more pieces.

**intern:** AWW MAN!

**Dutch:** Shut up.

Dutch gets back up, waiting for the intern to get up but he remains on the floor.

**Intern:** I’m just.. gonna.. lay here for a bit.

**Dutch:** Good. Atleast you know you’re beneath me.

The intern looks up at Dutch, half out of breath, completely annoyed.

**Dutch:** I’m going to tell you what you’re gonna do now. You are going to head into Boxie’s off-

**Intern:** Moxie?

**Dutch:** SHUT UP! You’re gonna head into Coxie’s offi-

**Intern:** Do you mean Mox-

Dutch raises his hand like he’s about to slap him and the Intern shrieks and puts his hands in front of his face.

**Intern:** Tell the cunt then that from now on, on promotional material, on the website, that I am now referred to as “**The** Mark Dutch.” I am deserving of the title of “The” for I have won AMUDOV, had the most eliminations in the Ultimate Happening in a single match, Won the shortest match, Former Indepe-

**Intern:** Didn’t you win that short match by DQ after Hex hit you over the head?

**Dutch:** Shuuut up. I have accomplished more in this federation than anyone ever has anywhe-

**Intern:** Didn’-

**Dutch:** I’LL HAVE YOU FUCKING FIRED IF YOU EVEN DARE TO INTERRUPT ME AGAIN AND ON THE LIST OF BAD INTERNS!

The intern wisely shuts his mouth and lets Dutch speak.

**Dutch:** Like I said.. former Independent Champion, former tag team cham- don’t say a word!

Dutch points down at the intern who desires to speak up.

**Dutch:** champion, future AMUDOV III winner and the most deserving WiR World Champion of all around. So.. you go to Floxie and tell her this, yeah?

The intern stays silent and Dutch looks on.. waiting for an answer.

**Dutch:** Now you can speak.

The intern looks at Dutch, still laying on the floor.

**Intern:** Okay Mr Du- I mean.. The Mr. Dutch.

**Dutch:** Good.

Dutch looks up, seeing Javier coming from the back after the show and Dutch quickly pulls out a badly folded paper.

**Dutch:** Javier! Stay there! I got something to discuss with you!

Dutch steps over the intern and heads to Javier. The camera remains focussed on the Intern as he slowly gets up.

**Intern:** …fucking Dutch people..

Immediately, Dutch pops up back on screen, his finger pointing at the intern.

**Dutch:** Do what I told you and get out of here. You’re fired!

**Intern:** You can’t do that! It’s not even your function in WiR.

**Dutch:** I’m The Mark Dutch.. and I have the final fucking word! NOW GO!

Dutch goes back out of screen and the intern looks on before looking back at the broken mug.

**Intern:** Aww man.."
56xvni,10,2016-10-11,My contribution to radiology education worldwide: StartRadiology.com,DutchRadResident,Radiology,https://www.reddit.com/r/Radiology/comments/56xvni/my_contribution_to_radiology_education_worldwide/,"Dear people, 
Perhaps you also noticed that the availability of educational radiology materials for interns/medical students is very limited.
This problem inspired me to develop a free accessible educational radiology platform: www.startradiology.com
StartRadiology explains in an understandable manner how to interpret radiological examinations that interns will encounter during the internships.

The project was originally intended for Dutch medical students/interns (www.startpuntradiologie.nl). The positive response prompted the launch of an English version also (7 July 2016), enabling even more medical students/interns to benefit from these materials.

I put my heart and soul into the project making practical classes in my spare time (text &amp; illustrations), so I really hope you like it :)
If you like it, spread the word! Hopefully this way even more students/interns and even residents can profit from the classes.

If you have any suggestions or ideas, let me know! Or maybe you know a better way to improve publicity? :)

Thanks a lot!"
56y841,2,2016-10-11,I [20 F] am not sure when or how to move on from my current internship that I don't really like?,when2switchjobs,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/56y841/i_20_f_am_not_sure_when_or_how_to_move_on_from_my/,"So last year I applied for an internship during this academic year and got it. I am a graphic design intern with a popular academic program. I started this year, and I don't really like it. I go into the office twice a week for a couple of hours, my boss tells me what he wants me to do, I sit down by myself and do it. Nobody really talks to me. It's usually super little stuff, like go into PS and change the date on an advertisement. Sometimes I design a flyer or powerpoint template. My boss says that all of the things I make get used, but I've never seen any of my flyers or templates or even the advertisements I tinker with get used.

It's unpaid, but I feel like it's impressive to say that I've worked with this organization. I'm not a graphic design major, though. I'm studying advertising/PR and I'm thinking about picking up a BA or at least a minor in computer science. My goal is to one day have a creative agency that deals with graphic design, sure, but also media campaigns and marketing strategy.

I'm taking introductory programming and I love it. It all seems to click for me. I'm really happy in this course. I had lunch with the professor and got to talking about my goals and my interest, if he thought it would be worthwhile to double up with CS, all that jazz.

He told me that he started a local company that's super in line with what I want to do, we chatted about it a bit, and he told me if I was ever looking for an internship, I should apply there and tell them he sent me.

I want that internship, guys. It sounds awesome. I looked at the website, and a lot of the things that they do are what I want to do, or things I'm interested in learning more about, like web design. I don't know if it would be paid, but it doesn't really matter, because I'm not paid at my current internship. This place, though, has good work benefits and a work ethic that I jive with. It's a kind of place I'd be interested in working at after I graduate. Where I'm at... not so much.

I just don't really know the etiquette for leaving my current internship. Should I at least finish the semester? Finish the year? Just go ahead and put in my two weeks? Try to talk to this place first and see what their availability is, just in case the professor was accidentally sending me on a wild goose chase?

  **tl;dr**: Don't like my current internship, have a better opportunity, not sure how to move forward from here."

Imi trebuie CV? Site-uri unde pot sa aplic si sa caut? Gasesc undeva sa ma angajez doar pentru cateva luni? Recomandari personale? Full-time? Part-time? Internship?

**Is there anything that may affect the way you answer the questions? For example, a stressful time, mental illness, medications, special life circumstances? Other useful information includes sex, age, and current state of mind.**

18F, freshman in college at a reasonably well-known state school, prospective econ and public policy major. Was on 50mg sertraline (zoloft) for generalized anxiety disorder for a period of 5 months and have now been off it for 1 month. I didn't like being on medication or admitting it. I still do see a therapist every couple of weeks to deal with my GAD.

**You are with a group of people in a car, heading to a different town to see your favourite band/artist/musician. Suddenly, the car breaks down for an unknown reason in the middle of nowhere. What are your initial thoughts? What are your outward reactions?**

I'd be pretty pissed, but outwardly after a couple seconds of ""well fuck"" and assuming no one knows what the problem is, I'd probably start by calling someone I know in the area and asking if there was any chance they could come by and get us because the car just broke down.

**You somehow make it to the concert. The driver wants to go to the afterparty that was announced (and assure you they won't drink so they can drive back later). How do you feel about this party? What do you do?**

I'm not a huge party person, but I'm down for that. I like talking to people. Having fun is fun. If I get super tired partway through I wouldn't be afraid to ask about leaving though.

**On the drive back, your friends are talking. A friend makes a claim that clashes with your current beliefs. What is your inward reaction? What do you outwardly say?**

Inwardly I make a note of it - I tend to remember that sort of thing about people. It wouldn't stop me from being friends with them at all, though. Outwardly, l even if I strongly disagree with someone I tend to go for the nod and smile approach because I don't want to get into an argument for no reason - not out of a desire to avoid hurting someone's feelings, but because it's honestly pointless and I'm not going to change their mind. If it's someone really close to me we can have a legitimate discussion about the merits of their opinion versus mine because I probably respect them and think they can back it up. If it's someone I'm never going to see again sometimes I'll argue just for the fun of ""sparring."" If it's someone I think I can convince I'll go for that. 

**What would you do if you actually saw/experienced something that clashes with your previous beliefs, experiences, values?**

If it's bad enough I will get confrontational. In high school a couple of years ago I cussed a kid out on the late bus who kept calling another kid gay/faggot. Not in my town, bitch.

**What are some of your most important values? How did you come about determining them? How can they change?**

This is the hardest question, hahaha. It's not like I don't have any values or something, I'm just not good with determining what they are until the moment of truth. Obviously, I don't want to hurt anyone for no reason and when I can I help people out. For example, about 6 months ago I ran into a group of my friends panicking because one of them was really hyperventilating and physically shaking because of a PTSD flashback. I held her hand - she likes this when she's freaked out like that - and walked her to the guidance office and tried to talk to her and calm her down the best I could. I would not describe myself as good with these situations (I am terrible at comforting people) but will act especially if no one else is acting appropriately/quickly enough.

**a) What about your personality most distinguishes you from everyone else? b) If you could change one thing about your personality, what would it be? Why?**

I am super dedicated and high energy. I will apply for literally any opportunity that will take me since I was in 7th grade and found out from an 8th grader you could skip a level of math by taking a summer course. (I told my parents about this, convinced them it was a good idea which wasn't too hard because they want me to succeed too, and did it! I don't regret it, I was able to transfer a lot of AP credits and got to know people in the grade above me.) I don't mind who I have to call, email, or meet in person, I will make shit work! Sure, I've embarrassed myself trying to do things, but better that than miss my chance.

As for the second part of the question, I wish the unwanted side effects of this - such as difficulty falling back asleep if I wake up really early (it sounds like a good problem to have until you have it), pacing (ugh, the pacing!), and over-scheduling. I want to say no to things, but the most difficult person to say no to is myself. Sometimes I feel like I'm possessed or something! The worst part is probably that I will really fucking beat myself up if I think I've screwed up, to the point where I have trouble eating and consider causing myself physical harm.

**How do you treat hunches or gut feelings? In what situations are they most often triggered?**

The most common types of hunches/gut feelings I get are about a person's intentions or personality when I'm talking to them. In general I trust it because even though I'm not as good at reading people as and INFJ or something would be, if I get a ""sense of someone"" I'm usually not wrong. It's usually just triggered by conversation. (Fun fact: I correctly guessed the first and second numbers in a friend's Enneagram type who I had met only about a month earlier.)

**a) What activities energize you most? b) What activities drain you most? Why?**

So I love talking to people and public speaking. I did Model UN, Youth and Government, and public forum debate in HS and am starting to get into college MUN (I'm headed to a conference this weekend at Yale actually!! #gethype) One of the most gratifying feelings is someone I've never met coming up to me after my speech and wanting to work on a resolution together.
 
For the second part, although I need my alone time, having to be alone and work on some boring ass task for hours is super draining. I had an internship at an immunology lab, which of course was a great opportunity but damn I could not be a research scientist.

**What do you repress about your outward behavior or internal thought process when around others? Why?**

I feel the need to fake socially acceptable emotions sometimes. Don't get me wrong, I have feelings. I'm not a robot in any way - I'm outgoing, talkative, pretty fun and it's not like I'm putting on a façade of humanity. I just don't always have them as much as I should at times and I feel social pressure to look like I do. I've also been told that I have a tendency to stare into space or look around the room when someone is talking to me. I have no problem making eye contact when I'm talking but when the other person is talking I look around occasionally. I swear I am listening, it's just a weird habit I have to suppress.

Thanks for taking the time to read this. Good luck with me ;)"

The interviewer basically said she didn't want someone who struggles typing, so I didn't get it (although she told me I was most qualified)

Are ALL accounting firms this way? Do you think it will be a challenge getting someone to hire me? I have high GPA, financial and tax preparer experience and I get along with everyone I meet. 

I worry I won't be able to find a job once they see my disability, I now worry I chose wrong major and should switch to something with less typing. 


In your position is typing speed super important? 
I've worked with accounting softwares before and it seemed more like short keys and not typing novels, so I didn't consider it as issue before.

I wanted to be genuine and honest so I told her that I ended up getting a lot of B's in the general education courses.

Then we went over my work experiences and she kept saying ""thats really great!"" or I totally agree with that ""insert some philosophy I mentioned"".

Then she told me of a time she went to Florida and started off at the very basic level but by the time she was done with that client she basically knew how to do everything and I really loved that so I asked a few more questions about it because I was curious but...

After I asked my questions about that she was like ""Well do you have anymore question about anything?"" (I'm estimating at the 25 min mark, interview was scheduled for 30 mins)

I got her email/number and I asked her about ""do associates get any voice on which clients they work on or is it more assigned by a manager type thing?"" She answered and I ran out questions so the interview ended...

Feels really weird to not have been asked more behavioral questions like every source on the internet portrays. Plus it ended early so I'm not sure how to take that and every interview I've ever had involved some type of discussion where they go over typical job duties I would have for the internship (I knew basically what they were but still) so worried cause that never happened.

Realistically, what do y'all think?"

Even socially, I have failed to make any lasting friendships in my entire time there. Academically, I think I have made my final mistake and will have to drop out, having missed the deadlines for several assignments already. For the past few semesters, any time I try to do get something done in regards to school, I always going through the same cycle of procrastination, missed deadlines, and dropped classes. There’s more W’s on my transcript than passing grades. I simply cannot muster up the energy or will-power to complete anything. At this point I really wish I had just never started college in the first place, but a myriad of familial and societal pressures has forced me to go down this path. 

So for a little bit of backstory, I have always struggled with depressive thoughts and suicidal tendencies throughout the majority of my life, but never sought help for it as I was able to distract myself from these feelings by keeping myself occupied with other things. When I graduated High School, all of my family and peers were certain that I would end up becoming a success. Arrogantly, I did not consider my depression to be a real serious issue as it did not affect other parts of my life - at least not until college. I started college as a Financial Economics major, but when I started failing classes due to a damning mix of depression and shitty work ethic, I had an existential crisis and switched my major to Political Science, a field which I have always been interested in. This was the first straw of many familial disappointments, as my parents had always dreamed of me entering a STEM field. However, even though I love the field of Poli Sci, I still could not face my depression and as such continued to miss and fail my classes in that field. I did not even seek any real help until my fifth year, when I could no longer keep up the façade of happiness/success to my parents. With them being first generation immigrants from a third world country, they never understood the impact that mental health plays into work ethic. Even now, a year after I had reached out to them, told them about my suicidal thoughts, and even saw a Psychiatrist a few times, my parents still treat my depression as insignificant. It’s almost as if the only way they would understand what I am going through mentally is if I actually did kill myself.

Still, at the end of the day the problems I am going through mean little in the physical world. Employers are not going to care that I was a depressed wreck throughout college, they simply want to see a degree. And I cannot even succeed in that, in my relatively easy field of study. Not only did I waste my parent’s money, but I have wasted my time and my potential. And now I think I am losing the few High School friends I was able to keep throughout the years; as their own lives progress farther down the social clock while I remain in college with no prospects for the future.  

The worst part is, my parents and my friends think I am going to be graduating within a few months’ time. I simply cannot find the courage to tell them that not only will I not be graduating this December, but that there is a chance I will not be allowed to return next semester. Even if I am allowed to return, I do not know how I will be able to finance my studies, and I dread having to ask my parents for more money to waste on their son.  

Weirdly enough, a part of me is content with ending as a friendless, sixth-year-college dropout as I have always kept suicide as an option. Even though I have entertained the idea of killing myself every single day for the past several years, now that I have exhausted all my options and cannot find anything else to live for, suicide is becoming a much more realistic option for me. So much time and money has been wasted on me that I have become nothing more than a burden to my family, as they sink more money into my educational money pit and see nothing in return. Sure, they might be hurt initially by the news of my death, but what will hurt them more is the shame of having a son that amounted to nothing. In the long run, my passing would be beneficial to the family. My parents would become financially secure, and they would no longer have a son that spends the majority of his time holed up in his room in front of a computer. Every day it becomes harder knowing that I have evolved into nothing more than a disappointment to my family, friends, peers – basically everyone that has known me for more than a few days. I simply do not know what to do anymore, and in a weeks’ time hopefully I will have mustered up the courage to jump off the Bay Bridge. I apologize for the long essay, but this is honestly the first time I’ve ever typed out my feelings.       

TLDR - Boy goes to college and fails, becomes an expensive disappointment to family and friends.

We've been talking about our future for a long time and have always said that we're looking forward to moving out and getting our own little flat together. We currently live with our parents and spend the majority of our free time together.

I've always been very academic, and have so far managed to coast through and done well. I always thought that if I went to university I'd study something that interests me, and I found a course at my local university that seemed great, and I'm enjoying it so far. It seemed the most stable path to me, I've worked in an office before and really didn't like it, so an apprenticeship (internship) wasn't appealing to me. The way I see it, by going to university and working really hard I'll come out with the best qualification I can, and then turn that into getting the best job that I can, I don't want to live from one pycheck to the next, I want a comfortable life and while it probably sounds naive, I'm willing to work hard to get my degree and turn that into getting a good job. 

My girlfriend was never a fan of academic studies, and she went down the apprenticeship route herself and did really well, and I'm really proud of her. However, she doesn't see the point in university - she says it's a waste of time and money. I can see where she's coming from, she has a decent argument, but I just wouldn't be comfortable just jumping into full time work now. I feel that I need the experiences of university and the qualification to make me feel comfortable and confident in getting a ""proper"" job. 

But she can't seem to understand my side of the argument. I listen to what she is saying, but when I try to put my points across, I get point blank answers of ""but you won't get a job in what you're studying, you're just putting yourself in debt and wasting 3 years - delaying us starting our life together"". This upsets me because of course I want to start our lives together! I love this girl more than anything else, and I can see us having a life together and having kids etc. 

I want to move in with her as soon as possible, but obviously as a student that can be difficult. Am I being selfish? I don't want to delay starting our life but I feel like carrying on with academia to a degree level will set us up for having a better future.

While serving a state prison sentence for the sexual abuse case in 1997, Reynolds was convicted again — this time in federal court on 15 fraud counts related to illegally raising campaign cash and defrauding banks out of hundreds of thousands of dollars. He was sentenced to 6 1/2 years in federal prison, but in 2001, President Bill Clinton commuted Reynolds' federal sentence with two years left to serve.""

572gau,3,2016-10-12,I don't have anyone to talk to and it's my own fault. Maybe I'm the crazy ex.,9048,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/572gau/i_dont_have_anyone_to_talk_to_and_its_my_own/,"TLDR: First world relationship problems. Ex-boyfriend of 5 years, best friend of 2.5 more years, goes no contact with me for a girl he's been long distance dating for 2 months and met twice during that time.

I don't know if this is the right place for this... I just get weirdly antsy about nobody knowing my thoughts. I tried organizing this a bit but it's not all organized and it's still a wall of text. I don't really mind if no one reads this, it just makes me feel more... secure in my existence? that my experiences are out there somewhere, whether in someone else's head or on the internet.

I don't know how to add a flair but I'm not sure whether or not I want advice anyways so it's all good.

- **October 2008**: I started college. I don't know how typical this is, but at my school most people hang out with the same 20 or so people from each class all 4 years. So I have known all of my college friends since I was a freshman, or since they were freshman (depending on who's older).

- **February 2009**: S and I began dating. He was in the class above me and we had been hanging out (along with other people in our classes) since the beginning of the school year. It was my first relationship, and his second (he dated a girl in his class for a few months the year before). 

- **2009-2011**: S and I were both in school. In retrospect, I quickly stopped putting in as much effort as I should have into my other friendships. Making friends was always difficult for me, and I used S as a crutch, and ended up as a bit of a hanger-on to his friend group. I had friends of my own, but I never put in the effort to cultivate deep friendships. I had people to hang out with and do fun things with, but if I needed someone to talk to, I only had S. At the time, it didn't occur to me that there was anything wrong with this, as I had been in the same situation all through middle school and high school, minus the boyfriend.

- **June 2011**: S graduated. He found a job in the area and we stayed together, seeing each other every weekend and quite often on the weekdays. 

- **June 2012**: I graduated, and began looking for a job in earnest. 

- **June 2012 - March 2014** I moved back in with my parents (5 hours drive away), but a few months later I moved in with S because that's where I was hoping to find a job. As months went on with barely any interviews, I felt more and more worthless and unwanted. I hesitate to say ""depressed"" because some people get pissy when you say it without a diagnosis... I no longer felt like I could go to S with a generic ""I feel unhappy"" because I didn't like how he reacted (pretty much just make a sympathetic sad face at me), and I began to feel disgusted at the thought of sex. Every night I cried myself to sleep while hiding my face from S, and every morning I pretended to be asleep while he got up and went to work. I was cranky all the time and felt guilty whenever I did anything that wasn't job-search-related. I never initiated sex, and I think S felt at the time that it would be ungentlemanly for him to do so. I might have been receptive if he had done so in the earlier days... no way to know now. Some time in 2013 I got an internship, which was low-paid and meant to be temporary, so my job search continued. I think it was during this time when finally, S turned to me and said, ""Hey... do you want to have sex?"" I reacted with disgust and I probably should have ended things. I knew for a long time that it was wrong for me to keep him on the hook like that, but I was afraid I would lose my only friend at a time when the rest of my life was also so uncertain. Finally, my boss at the internship decided to take me full-time. 

- **April 2014**: Soon after I got the offer, I suggested to S that we move into a 2-bedroom apartment. I had meant it as a first step to sloooowly officially breaking up (dumb? yeah probably, this was my first relationship), but he took the suggestion itself as a break-up and was pretty much fine with it. So we found a really great 2-bedroom and moved into our separate rooms. We didn't tell any of our friends about the breakup right away, but planned to be honest if anyone asked. I don't like being the center of attention, and the ending of a 5-year relationship (one of the longest in our circle of acquaintances) would have been big news, so I was glad for it to instantly be ""old news"" as soon as it was known. During this time S also got laid off from his job but quickly found another one in the area.

- **October 2014 - December 2015**: Life was good! The shadow that hung over me during my job search was almost completely gone and our friendship improved drastically. We had our private spaces but we hung out most of the time, we cooked together save money and effort, watched TV shows, and hosted board game days with a couple of college friends. By this time our breakup was fully public and S started online dating. My only reservation was that I had had idle fantasies of being his wingman, but since neither of us go to bars it was never gonna happen. Other than that, I was happy for him, found places to be when he had girls over, offered date ideas, etc. However, he was increasingly unhappy with his job and began looking elsewhere. Eventually he got an offer that he was very happy with, but which was further away from our apartment.

- **January 2016**: Sharing an apartment with my best friend continued to be awesome. S organized for a group of 9-10 college friends to go to a convention together in August. I had gotten a raise and was gradually getting used to being able to spend money on fun stuff, so it was a little scary but I committed to going. S started his new job and soon found the commute unbearable, so we began to separately search for apartments (rather slowly and unenthusiastically, as we both loved our old apartment).

- **May 2016**: Both of us finished moving, we now lived about an hour away from each other. Since our college friends were already scattered over the same range, we hoped our weekend activities wouldn't be too disrupted. It was generally a busy time for all of us, though, so we didn't get to find out the impact our move would have.

- **July 2016**: S reveals to me that he had started dating B about a month ago. B was part of the group for the convention, a girl in my class who I had roomed with one year and worked on a big project together for fun. She lived about 5 hours away near another group of college friends. S said he was telling me so I wouldn't be surprised when they were together at the convention. I was taken aback, and I was bothered for many reasons that I didn't sort out until later (and maybe more that I still haven't sorted out). Still, I tried to be happy for him, was happy B would probably be visiting more often, and tried to think of ways he could make the constant travel work better. 

- **August 2016**: S and I were traveling together to the convention and I was super excited, but he just ended up texting most of the time. B and another friend were waiting for us in the hotel lobby and he had me go check in so he could talk to her. There was some weird stuff about him having organized the hotel rooms through the convention, and I tried to get his attention to come over and help me sort it out since they used his card for the reservation, but he was 20 feet away and ignored me. At the convention, I ended up feeling like a bit of a... 9th wheel? So I spent the last 3 out of 4 days of the convention by myself. Seeing S and B together honestly made me feel a little uncomfortable. I felt like I didn't know S at all. I can't remember if we were that PDA-y when we were dating. On the last day, I kept asking people when they were heading to the con, hoping to split a car and maybe actually do some stuff in a group, but no one would answer me. I had some bananas left over and my roommates had gone so I asked S if he wanted them for his room. He said sure, but then he would not meet me in the lobby, would not tell me when he was planning on heading out, and would not tell me his room number! ???????????? It's not like he and B were alone together, they were sharing the room with two brothers, who were both still there! And he was uncharacteristically slow to reply to everything so I wasted 45 minutes trying to give him the bananas, and ended up throwing them away and going to the con alone again. 

My flight back was a couple hours earlier than his, but mine was delayed so we arrived at around the same time. We split an uber but other than that he just texted the whole time and wouldn't speak to me.

When I got home, I messaged him complaining that I would have liked at least a ""Hi, how was your day?"" He replied along the lines of ""You're an adult and can be expected to take care of yourself, it's not my job to check up on you and make sure you're having fun."" Well yeah it's not his job but I didn't think it'd be such a chore to give a shit. I complained that we had all arranged to go to the con together, and nobody cared that they didn't see me for 3 days, but I had thought at least he would care. He claimed that if I didn't come back to the hotel one night, everyone would have dropped everything to find me. So, I'm reading that as ""I didn't even notice that you in fact didn't come back one night"". He told me that we were too close, and that he couldn't care about other people properly if he was still my friend. He told me never to contact him.

We had just moved out 3 months ago from being roommates to living an hour apart! We went from seeing each other every day to seeing each other every other week, and things had still not settled from our moves. Could he not have waited to see how things shook out? It seems clear that just being in a board game group together would still have been too much for him. He claims that I meant more to him than just ""player #4"", someone who only exists to fill out player counts, but that is where we were heading and it was more than he wanted. 

I tried going to a therapist because I felt like I needed a friend and I had heard that therapists were people you could pay to pretend to care about you. She couldn't seem to get over the fact that S and I used to date. She kept saying ""Well maybe this is a good thing! Nobody knows what the future holds, maybe this way you'll end up finding a ~boyfriend~!"" I didn't go back.

S was the only person to ever fully, 100% convince me that he did genuinely enjoy my company and want me around, and now he's the only person who has explicitly told me that he doesn't want me around. Most of my friends were his friends first, so I've lost them too. I think they mostly feel the same way I initially did about S and B's relationship (one of them is B's ex ""O"") but they are all better friends with both of them than they ever have been with me.

It's been two months since then, hard for me to believe. Facebook told me that we became friends 8 years ago today. I can't imagine myself ever having a friend again, and my insecurities are telling me that I never did have a friend.


Here are the reasons I don't like their relationship.
1. I don't understand relationships that start out as long-distance. I don't really get how long-distance relationships work in general but I can at least see how it happens if they start out closer.

2. O attempted a long-distance relationship with her (maybe 2 hours distance). It didn't go well. They tried an open relationship, which I think he wasn't enthusiastic about but preferred to a breakup, so that predictably went poorly. I'm guessing S and B now are doing this, and I don't think this is S's style. But hey, maybe I'm wrong. We dated for 5 years but we were awkward nerds and never talked about it.

3. If S is not happy in his relationship, I think he will suck it up rather than end things. See: the 1.5 YEAR period in 2013 when I was just terrible, and we didn't even have sex, and I was still the one to break things off.

4. (selfish) Most of my current friends were in a tight-knit group during college, which S and I were not a part of, but B was. They tend to make a lot of inside jokes and references from times when we were not part of the group. I don't like it, but at least I had S on the outside with me. Now I wouldn't (even if our group was able to work together again).

5. How does a grown man think he developed a crush on someone he has seen maybe 7 times in the past 4 years??? The last time S saw B more than 2-3 times a year, we were still happily dating. And then unhappily dating for another 1.5 years after that. (She was also happily dating O at the time and then another 1.5 years as well.) So my insecurities are telling me that he's been waiting for her to be single since well before we broke up.

6. O and I spoke a bit after they got together, as the main ex's I guess. O says B never wants marriage or kids. S and I never talked about it (yes dumb I know. First major relationship for both of us and we were in college most of the time) but my impression is that he kind of did, eventually. I dunno. Maybe I never knew him that well. "
572hws,5,2016-10-12,Is it okay to take a job in an area of law I don't want to stay in?,Lawyerstruggles,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/572hws/is_it_okay_to_take_a_job_in_an_area_of_law_i_dont/,"I recently graduated from law school and I have been job hunting. I just found a clerk job at a firm in criminal law. I did a clinic in law school related to the work they do, which is why I think they hired me. The work they do is compelling, high-level stuff and I am grateful for the opportunity. I've been there for a couple of weeks now.

Here's the catch-I am not interested in criminal law. At all. Even at this firm, which is  great, I really don't have the stomach for it and I don't see a future myself here at all.

My question is this-should I stay on at this firm for now? I get bar results next month. If I do not pass, I would want to go back to full time studying. If I do pass, I figure it'll be easier to find a job in an area I am interested. The areas I am interested in are family law and employment law (I have clinical experience in the former and internship experience in the latter).

Will the fact that my most recent experience (even for only a couple of months) is in criminal law hinder my abilities to find a job in the areas of law I like? Or is it better to do this for now rather than having a gap on my resume? Thanks in advance, guys!"
572ivh,3,2016-10-12,Deciding employment between a CivE or Cost Engineer,civelife,civilengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/civilengineering/comments/572ivh/deciding_employment_between_a_cive_or_cost/,"**Can likely skip my back-story until questions**

I'm a recent Civil Engineering graduate with 3 summers of intern experience at an international design firm in their structural department. I've learned a lot and kept going back because I enjoyed the work environment (friendly people/intern events) and the opportunities to learn about the multiple careers that having a major in civil engineering could lead to. I can't say I have found my ""niche"" in what I want to do in this broad and amazing study, but I believe I am academically and professionally qualified to learn/comply in any entry level position.

Since graduation and applying for jobs, I have been more interested in contracting and the construction side of things because I am not sure if I *love* design work, but I know I am extremely interested in the concepts of engineering and how they are implemented in real world projects (and wouldn't mind being outside of the office for once). I have been studying for my FE (more casually than I'd like to admit) which a lot of companies prefer/require but am not entirely sure if I plan to get my PE. A lot of my classmates (80%+) joined large contractor firms with the intentions of getting their MBAs and not continue their engineering education in the foreseeable future. Until recently, I never thought about this but I definitely see myself more of a manager than an engineer in the long run. I am really good working in teams and can't say I am the most technically gifted/mathematical person but really enjoy the concepts that engineering entails.

Recently, I was given notice that I should receive an offer for a civil engineer position in a small civil-structure department team for the world's largest public transportation agency. It seems very challenging but a good place to start my career as a civil engineer, with lots of support and projects available. However, the paperwork may take another month before I can start work and I am not sure if I really want to pursue a career in design civil engineering (not very strong with all the equations and calc off the top of my head). Also, the position may be contingent on me getting my EIT, which I am not exactly in a rush to get.

More recently, I was also given a higher-paying offer for a cost engineer position in a local electrical contractor company. It sounds like they really want/need me for the position (new 28 month project just started which I would be involved in). However, I really don't know what to expect as a Cost Engineer; The job description sounds simple enough and I've done some estimation work for my senior design project and past internship work but it was really just plugging in quantities and maybe unit costs for items in specific programs. The interview was very unchallenging and seems like they would have offered the position to anyone with a 4 year college degree and was semi-sociable, I was just lucky to be (one of?) the first. I am unsure if they are just desperate for someone to join the team since the project just started or of this position is  just really had to fill and it's not what it's cut out to be (never met a cost engineer/can't find many anecdotes/reviews about the position). It also helps that they don't really require me to get my EIT. I really want to take this position but have some concerns and am hoping someone can help/provide input; It is preferred that I make a decision by the end of this week.

Some concerns are:

1. What exactly do cost engineers do? What are the challenges/pros compared to working as a ""real"" engineer (civil, mechanical, etc.)? Why do they get paid more, are their hours worse? What does the career development path look like? The company tells me it would be a good pathway into project manager, is that true?

2. Can work done as a cost engineer be considered in the 4 years of professional experience required for the PE license, if I choose to pursue it? Would working with the electrical contractor firm be detrimental to me, as opposed to working with a construction contractor firm, should I pursue my engineering license? (I won't learn about CivE work as much) Would it be easy to move out back into a civil engineering role?

Thank you for taking the time to read this, any advice would be much appreciated!"

5732dv,79,2016-10-12,Oliver's birth story. Very long - get comfy and a cup of tea!,Labrador__Retriever,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/5732dv/olivers_birth_story_very_long_get_comfy_and_a_cup/,"It wasn’t the best or easiest pregnancy. I was sick with HG from week 6, but got a few good weeks between 18-25 (got married and went on our honeymoon!) before I started to feel worse and worse. I remember my midwife telling me around 25 that I should enjoy this time because I was about to get really uncomfortable and she was right!



As I got bigger I started to feel worse and worse. The HG came back and by week 33 I was really struggling with low back pain, pelvic pain, abdominal pain, constantly feeling like I needed to pee, insomnia and, shockingly, irritability. My midwife was a bit concerned at my 36 week appointment because my BP was elevated and I had developed some edema in my ankles and hands (goodbye, wedding rings!) but a NST showed that baby was still doing fine. Midwife said that I’d likely go in for another NST after my 37 week apt to keep an eye on things and I pressured her into giving me an induction date – October 20, 10 days after my EDD. I was so relieved to know the date I could press the eject button because by this point I was quite miserable. I was scheduled to work until Sept 30 but was exhausted and cranky and uncomfortable all day every day.



On Sunday the 18th my husband and I did some last minute errands at the mall. I was not very happy that day. I could barely walk due to the pain in my hips, pelvis and low back, and was irrationally mad at my husband for normal things such as needing to walk to get to the washroom at the mall. In hindsight, I was in early labour. When we got home I burst into tears, “I just don’t want to be pregnant anymore,” I wailed. I was feeling sorry for myself and ran a bath to relax. When I got out of the bath I noticed that I was experiencing some period cramps and kept feeling the need to have a BM. I tried going to the washroom several times but only ended up wiping away what I realized was my mucous plug. It was like egg white discharge that had a bit of colour at times, other times it was completely clear. Around 5pm I told my husband that I thought I might be having some contractions, but because I was 36+6 this might not mean anything at all so I’d just keep an eye on things. 



I had put on a pad due to the mucous plug, and was lying in bed around 10 when I felt a small gush. I sat up and ran to the washroom where more liquid came out of me and was pretty convinced that it was my water breaking. I called the midwife who recommended I take a gravol and Tylenol and try to get some sleep, but to call her if the contractions came 5 minutes apart for 3 hours. I laid in bed until about midnight and tried to sleep (LOL, who can sleep when they might be in labour?!) but by midnight I was having very painful contractions that were coming frequently. I told my husband that I was going to start timing them but to be prepared as I thought I was in labour.



A note about my husband: he is lovely. Very lovely, but not the most prepared person in the whole world. So it was only at this point in my pregnancy that he picked up the pregnancy book to read about early labour. Yes, midnight and my contractions were 90 seconds long, 5 minutes apart, and he was making suggestions like “the book says early labour can last a while and you should do an activity like go for a walk in the park. Do you want to go for a walk?” Luckily for him I wasn’t able to talk through the contractions so he didn’t know what I thought about his “helpful suggestions” and I sent him to bed so I wouldn’t have to listen to any more of his nonsense. 



I labored while he slept for the next 2 hours but by 2am the contractions were almost unbearable and I was weeping in between them. I always thought I’d try to have a drug free birth, but I certainly was not married to the idea and was open to any interventions that would result in a successful delivery. By this point I knew I would not be able to make it without an epidural so I woke up my husband to let him know it was go time (“do you want to go for a walk first? The book says maybe you should have a bath?”) and at 3am called the midwife to meet us at the hospital.



I threw a couple changes of clothes into my bag in the 3 minutes I had between contractions, and we started to load up the car. My husband, lovely as he is, still did not realize the extent of pain I was in and, mid contraction, would ask me vital questions such as “have you seen the umbrella?” I finally lost my cool entirely on him and screamed “STOP ASKING ME QUESTIONS WHEN I’M IN THE MIDDLE OF A CONTRACTION I DON’T CARE ABOUT THE FUCKING UMBRELLA.”  I think it was at that point he realized that I was not fucking around.



We got to the hospital at 4am and I asked for an epidural right away since I knew it could take a while. The midwife got things rolling and had a nurse come in to place the IV saline to prep me, but because my veins are so small she was having some issues getting a vein. She finally found one and tried to place the IV but my vein collapsed almost immediately and she ran out of the room. Later I found out that she had pricked herself with the needle and ran to get another nurse, but left my tourniquet around my arm in her understandable haste. Did you know that leaving the tourniquet on would turn your vein into Old Faithful? However, I didn’t even notice that I was spewing blood since the contractions were so painful. After that, 2 more nurses came in to place the IV but they both also failed. Finally, at 7am the anesthesiologist came in and placed the IV in my hand, and gave me the epidural. I was able, at last, to get some relief. The epidural was amaaaaazing but gave me the shakes really badly. I have never experienced anything like that before but luckily they went away after an hour or so.



Once I was comfortable, Rob went out to meet his parents for breakfast. The midwife had said it would be several more hours until anything would be happening, so I felt okay with him going out for half an hour or so. Once he left, the pain started increasing so I asked the nurse if we could top up the epidural. She pressed the button and almost immediately the baby’s heart rate started dropping. Normal heart rate is around 140 BPM but I heard it slow and slow to about 75-80 BPM. The nurse seemed very concerned and I asked if I should text Rob to get him to come back – it had only been about 10 minutes. She nodded and while I texted him to come back ASAP, the room filled with people. My position was adjusted a few times before his heart rate stabilized, but after that I had to stay lying on my side to prevent any more decels. Once everything was settled Rob came running back in the room thinking I was delivering but by that point all the excitement had died down. 



Until noon I dozed and chatted with Rob, the midwife and the nurse. They had told me that I would probably push for 2 hours and at about 12:15 the midwife checked me again and told me I was fully dilated and ready to push. At this point I started to get some anxiety; I knew that the last 9 months had been leading up to this moment but somehow I didn’t feel like I had enough notice. I had a mad desire to tell everyone I wasn’t ready, but I was ready…at least my body was. 



I started to get pressure with each contraction like I was going to have a BM. Because we were too nervous about another decel to top up the epidural again, I was able to feel the pressure with each contraction and the midwife coached me on how to push with the contractions. Rob held my hand and the intern held my leg as I pushed. With each contraction I would take a deep breath and push down, then quickly take another deep breath and push into that one so the progress wasn’t lost. I was getting about 4-5 pushes with each contraction but it didn’t feel like I was making much headway. I was pushing so hard it was making me nauseous, and as time went on the epidural started to wear off. Finally, the midwife told me that we were very close and that I would notice increased pressure that didn’t let up; once this would happen I was to listen to her coaching for each push so I didn’t tear. A few more pushes later and I could feel him very engaged, the pressure was incredible and it was very painful. Prior to this there was relief in between contractions, but at this point there was no relief between them at all. The midwife was telling me to push but I was scared and crying out that I couldn’t do it; if I was able I would have walked right out of there. I truly felt that I wasn’t able to go on but right at that moment, the nurse put her face close to mine and in my ear told me that I was so close, that I was almost there. This gave me the strength to push again, and I cried out with the gush that came out of me and my son was born! I was sobbing with relief and surprise and being completely overwhelmed and I couldn’t believe that I had done it. On Monday September 19th at 2:14pm, I had actually given birth to my son.



The midwife took him and placed him on my chest and I got to see his face for the first time. He was tiny and perfect, and looked at me with dark grey eyes. I was still sobbing in disbelief that I had made this creature and that I was his mom now. I couldn’t believe that this human had been inside me just a few moments before. I looked at him and he looked back at me, and he pursed his lips into a tiny O shape, something he would keep doing to this day.



The nurse and midwife pressed on my stomach a bit and tugged at the cord and asked me to push. I gave one final push and the placenta came out with a flop, and I was flooded with a sense of relief. I’m not sure why but it was almost more relieving than birthing the baby. By now the cord had stopped pulsing so Rob cut it and they took the baby to be weighed and measured – 6lbs 10.5 oz. The midwife was very impressed by his striking cone head and joked that it would probably add a few inches to his length. They looked me over and said I had a couple abrasions but no tears so they got me set up with the mesh panties and an ice pack (amazing!) and let us rest skin to skin.



We spent some time in the delivery room until I was able to pee, then we moved into the maternity ward around 5pm. The nurse kindly brought me some tea and toast, and some dinner a bit later. I felt like I had run a marathon. We tried breastfeeding but it was very difficult for him to latch, I wasn’t making any colostrum, and he was also very, very sleepy and didn’t have any interest in feeding. The next day the midwife recommended I stay another night in the hospital until we were confident with breastfeeding and she gave me a nipple shield to try. This helped a tiny bit, but we still really struggled; my nipples were bleeding and painful and I started to dread feeding him.



The next day as we were packing up all of our belongings to go home, a nurse came in and told us that baby was very jaundiced and would have to be admitted to the NICU for phototherapy. She recommended supplementing with formula and starting to pump, and as soon as I agreed they had whisked him off. The combination of hormones, and finding out that my son was not okay and perfect made me break down. With tears streaming down my face, I listened to the pediatrician tell me that I would need to stay several more days in the hospital. 



We were put on a new schedule – every 3 hours I would go to the NICU to breastfeed for 15 minutes, then the nurse would feed him formula under the lights and I would pump for 15 minutes. The formula was necessary to flush the bilirubin from his system as my milk hadn’t yet come in. The pediatrician explained that we had an ABO blood type incompatibility that caused the jaundice, and it would take a few extra days to get his levels under control. 



After 3 days of being under quadruple lights, he was finally well enough to come home. It’s been 2 and a half weeks since then, and it still feels a bit surreal. I have this tiny creature that is so helpless and tiny, but who loves to snuggle and nap with me. We’re still having some issues breastfeeding, but he’s eating and gaining weight and I can see his tiny fingers getting chubby. 



My pregnancy was planned but the timing was not. I was hugely surprised when we found out which made it hard for me to get excited about having a baby. I didn’t feel ready to give up my life and my relationship quite yet. Further, I was so miserable for most of the time I wasn’t able to imagine that I would or could be happy when he finally came. Now that I have him, I wish I could re-do my pregnancy. I wish that I could know that I would love this perfect nugget so much, and that I would have the best little snuggle buddy anyone could ask for. I think that if I had known how I feel now, I would have enjoyed my pregnancy a lot more…or at least not been so resentful of every pain and inconvenience it brought. 



People always said that the moment I laid eyes on him I would fall in love. I’m not sure if that’s true for me, exactly. The birthing process is amazing and awe inspiring and overwhelming. There were so many feelings that I’m sure love was one of them, but as the days go by the love just grows and grows. Even though I’m tired from being up all night, I’m trying to savor the moments when the house is quiet and I have a warm, tiny, perfect human on my chest. Rocking him to sleep at 3am is something that I never thought I’d be okay with but somehow I never want to let go of the moments when everything is still and our lives stretch out in front of us with so much potential. Thinking of the future brings me to tears because I know these times are so special and so precious and every night that I hold him is one that I can never get back. 



This sub was an integral part of my pregnancy. I didn’t post much but I gained so much strength from connecting with you ladies. I’m not sure if I can think of a more welcoming, supportive, empathetic and understanding place for somebody going through such a huge life change. Thank you all for sharing your stories and offering your strength and wisdom. You have touched me in a way that I will never forget, and I am so grateful to have been a part of this community. 



Thank you.

Trump is obviously referring to the sexual allegations that have long swirled around Clinton, even before he became president.

Rand Paul (R-Ky.) wrongly claimed that a half dozen women had called Clinton a “sexual predator.” But for younger voters who may be wondering what the fuss is about, here again is a guide to the various claims made about Clinton’s sex life.  We will divide the stories into two parts: consensual liaisons admitted by the women in question and allegations of an unwanted sexual encounter. Consensual affairs  *Gennifer Flowers *— a model and actress whose claims of a long-term affair nearly wrecked Clinton’s first run for the presidency in 1992. (Clinton denied her claims at the time, but under oath in 1998 he acknowledged a sexual encounter with her.)  *Monica Lewinsky *— intern at the White House, whose affair with Clinton fueled impeachment charges. This was a consensual affair, in which Lewinsky was an eager participant; she was 22 when the affair started and Clinton was her boss.  *Dolly Kyle Browning *— A high school friend who said in a sworn declaration &lt;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/pjones/docs/browning031398.htm&gt; that she had had a 22-year off-and-on sexual relationship with Clinton.  *Elizabeth Ward Gracen *— a former Miss America who said she had a one-night stand with Clinton while he was governor — and she was married. She went public &lt;http://news.google.co.nz/newspapers?id=uxUSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=FOsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4296,5792168&amp;dq=bill-clinton+elizabeth-ward&amp;hl=en&gt; to specifically deny reports he had forced himself on her.  Some might argue that because Lewinsky and Gracen had relations when Clinton was in a position of executive authority, Clinton engaged in sexual harassment. Allegations of an unwanted sexual encounter  *Paula Jones *— A former Arkansas state employee who alleged that in 1991 Clinton, while governor, propositioned her and exposed himself. She later filed a sexual harassment suit, and it was during a deposition in that suit that Clinton initially denied having sexual relations with Lewinsky. Clinton in 1998 settled the suit for $850,000, with no apology or admission of guilt. All but $200,000 was directed to pay legal fees.  *Juanita Broaddrick *— The nursing home administrator emerged after the impeachment trial to allege &lt;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/broaddrick022599.htm&gt; that 21 years earlier Clinton had raped her. Clinton flatly denied the claim, and there were inconsistencies in her story. No charges were ever brought.  *Kathleen Willey *— The former White House aide claimed Clinton groped her in his office in 1993, on the same day when her husband, facing embezzlement charges, died in an apparent suicide. (Her story changed over time. During a deposition in the Paula Jones matter, she initially said she had no recollection about whether Clinton kissed her and insisted he did not fondle her.) Clinton denied her account, and the independent prosecutor concluded &lt;http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-ICREPORT-LEWINSKY/pdf/GPO-ICREPORT-LEWINSKY-12.pdf&gt; “there is insufficient evidence to prove to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that President Clinton’s testimony regarding Kathleen Willey was false.” Willey later began to claim &lt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-492205/Hillary-Clinton-faces-sensational-claims-woman-Bills-past.html&gt; Clinton had a hand in her husband’s death, even though her husband left behind a suicide note.  Note that no court of law ever found Clinton guilty of the accusations.  Peter Baker, in “The Breach &lt;http://www.amazon.com/The-Breach-Inside-Impeachment-William/dp/1476730075&gt;,” the definitive account of the impeachment saga, reported that House investigators later found in the files of the independent prosecutor that Jones’s lawyers had collected the names of 21 different women they suspected had had a sexual relationship with Clinton. Baker described the files as “wild allegations, sometimes based on nothing more than hearsay claims of third-party witnesses.” But there were some allegations (page 138) that suggested unwelcome advances:  “One woman was alleged to have been asked by Clinton to give him oral sex in a car while he was the state attorney general (a claim she denied). A former Arkansas state employee said that during a presentation, then-Governor Clinton walked behind her and rubbed his pelvis up against her repeatedly. A woman identified as a third cousin of Clinton’s supposedly told her drug counselor during treatment in Arkansas that she was abused by Clinton when she was baby-sitting at the Governor’s Mansion in Little Rock.”  The Bottom Line  Trump’s claim is a bit too vague for a fact check. In any case, we imagine readers will have widely divergent reactions to this list of admitted affairs and unproven allegations of unwanted sexual encounters. But at least you now know the specific cases that Trump is referencing.

5745im,6,2016-10-12,Found my mother years after her psychotic break and disappearance. She is homeless and I don't know how to help her.,pandapadawan,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/5745im/found_my_mother_years_after_her_psychotic_break/,"The backstory for this is a bit complicated, so bear with me:

I was just notified from my dad that he has received a letter from a stranger who kept passing a homeless woman on her commute. She had pity and decided to talk to her, and this homeless woman asked her to write a letter to my dad's address so he can pick her up. Included in the letter is a garbled little handwritten note from my mother. This stranger goes on to say that my mother lives on a street corner downtown (quite close to where I live), and that she hopes someone will be able to come take care of her. The stranger also provided her phone number to contact her if I have any questions.

I have not called this lady yet, and it will probably be good to have my thoughts in order anyway, because I'm at a loss of how to help my mother.

1) My dad is not going to take her in. Not only has he remarried, but she also ruined his life in their divorce and kind of damaged the psyche of my younger siblings due to her neglect so I can understand why he wouldn't want her under his roof. He said it is up to me how to address the situation.

2) I can't take care of her. I'm a student who is working under a low paid internship; I don't have the financial (and frankly, emotional) resources to take care of her needs.

3) On my mother's side, the only relatives are my aunt, who lives far away and has a family to take care of, and my uncle, who refused to take care of her. 

4) She has refused treatment many times in the past, because she didn't believe she was ill. I'm trying to look up involuntary commitment laws in Texas but it's rather confusing as to whether it's even possible.  

5) I don't have great health insurance or money to pay for her stay at an institution or costly legal fees.

I really don't know what to do here. If anyone's gone through a similar situation or has some advice, please let me know.

A little bit more about me is that I'm a programmer and I've been with geek circles for as long as I have remembered.

Recently I started to notice this girl (who is an intern at my place I believe) and it's sorta the first time I actually am bothered to take notice on the opposite gender. Being socially inept however, I have no idea on how to break the ice.

What should I do?"
574ki1,10,2016-10-12,"Team size vs client base size, how are you growing?",HTechs,msp,https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/574ki1/team_size_vs_client_base_size_how_are_you_growing/,"I'm curious how many 1 man shops vs 50+ employee MSP's are here... and how everyone handles their growth.

**1:** How does everyone fare as far as their internal teams and their breakdown vs their total number of daily/monthly clients?

- We have four helpdesk/onsite techs with a mixed knowledge of level 1 and 2
- A level 2-3 server/net admin
- A helpdesk manager who quintuples as level 2-3 escalation, web development, internal process/reporting management, project management, and everything else no one is doing
- A billing/office manager who also doubles as marketing/web
- A purchasing/ordering manager
- A Vice president who handles clients, sales, project management, invoicing, and level 2-3 escalation
- A President who does sales, project creation, whatever else...
- So a team of ten people for about 160 clients - 60 or so managed, 100 or so break fix/block hour. (1000-1200 endpoints)



**2:** Are you finding your current team is able to maintain their workload?

- In our case there are times we struggle and get overloaded. We seem to carry an average base of 50 open tickets (we're hitting SLA's about 97% for closeout... usually waiting on clients), plus 20-30 quote/project tickets at any given time. The problems we face are when multiple clients decide to move to new office space, upgrade infrastructure, or other projects come up all in the same time frame, you know how those 10 project hours suddenly become 20 because of a vendor (say... Comcast? lol) or because half your team is out of the office, your daily support suffers. 



**3:** What does your weekly ticket load look like?

- We're seeing about ~200 tickets a week come through the office plus project work.



**4:** When do you decide it's time to hire someone else and/or look at 3rd party solutions?

- We find that sometimes a decent intern can help bridge the gap during these times... but as the company grows, it's hard to know if you need the chicken or the egg first... Proactively hire before the work arrives, or get the work, and then hire to respond to it."
575ex8,1,2016-10-12,Having hard feelings towards my partner,gentlewaveofmusic,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/575ex8/having_hard_feelings_towards_my_partner/,"This is the story, I'll write it cronologically.  I'll call her Hanna:

- We met at college and became really good classmates.
- We won't see each other anymore as we are separated by classes.
- I get a long term boyfriend, I'll call him Ed.
- Hanna and I share classes together again and from my point of view we became good friends.
- She joins a pyramidal company, gets brainwashed and the only times she calls me is just to convince me to join as well. I politely refuse. She also calls me for money so she scales in that company. I politely refuse. She borrows some shorts from me for that same damn fraudulent pyramid shit and never returns it.
- I break down and tell Ed about the whole situation, complaining and doubting about her true friendship. He notices it too and comforts me.
- Months pass by and I brake up with Ed. 
 Hanna is no longer on that company, I do not know about her lately, she's got het 'pyramidal' friends.
- I leave all the harsh feelings behind and Hanna and I share the final project. Success. We are getting along well.
- Months pass and that final project leads us to be business partners on a startup. It's just a CTO, two interns, Hanna and I.
- I learn Hanna is a already an indirect partner of the startup, that gives her some kind of privilege. It's ok
- Hanna talks to me about liking my ex Ed, kind of asking me for permission to date him if possible. Who am I to judge a possible good relationship? I have a happy new relationship with my actual boyfriend Louis. I wish her the best but hope Ed is not playing with her as he knows some background about us.
- Hanna starts GOING OUT WITH ED. I notice, my friends notice, they recomfort me and hate on her but I'm alright, I guess.
- It becomes extremely difficult to work with her knowing she's dating my ex. I leave the office early some days as it gets harder to take it. ""Was she ever my friend? "" 
- My interests change and I finally no longer consider her my friend. Just a good business partner.
- She asks me to meet at the café to talk and I agree. She tells me Ed dumped her for other girl (his actual girlfriend) and breaks down apologizing about the whole situation. I forgive her, I have to be professional and actually I kind of hate of Ed for breaking her heart. Ed might had wanted to hurt me in that way. I forget the whole thing.
- CTO names Hanna CEO. I have issue with this not because I'm not the CEO, but because the CEO is her, I think the CTO was more valuable to be the CEO as well.

Two years passed... We get along well and never fight but deep down it gets harder and harder for me to work this way. I feel I don't trust her and I don't belong here but I'm too essential to the startup and I'm compromised with what I'm doing here... I feel trapped in this infinite loop of hard feelings then liking her again then hard feelings again.  

I need new points of view for this whole situation... I am having low self esteem, feeling dumb, feeling inner rage and sadness... No one knows about this but you people... thanks for reading my long post."

BACKGROUND:

So let me just put this first, we both come from a conservative culture and are both the ""wait until marriage"" kinda people. so please keep that in mind while reading.


Okay so here's our story, I've known her for about 4 years then about 3 years ago we decided we wanted to be together, and last year (august) we both moved to study Masters abroad, in the same University too but we didnt live together, so what happened is that we both were too busy at the time so we werent spending much time together and it would happen that a day or 2 would pass by where we dont talk and sometimes a week without us seeing each other, we never talked about this and I thought that it was normal, of course I would still make a big deal for her on her birthday and I was there whenever she wanted anything and I would always find time to spend some special time together and have some cute surprises for her, So about 6 months later, she was relocated to a different city, after that we started talking almost everyday and I told her that I dont want a day to pass without us talking/texting, so then after about a month and a half of her moving away, I started losing the feeling of being loved and she started acting differently, so I asked her what was going on and she said that 2 months ago because she wasnt feeling loved by me, she was able to stop loving me as much as she did, we stayed in a relationship for about a month after and then she asked me if we can take a break for a couple of months, I was/am ready to do anything for her, so after she gave me a reason, I said okay.

Not a day has passed for the next 6 months (break lasted for 3 months) without us talking/texting, but most of the time she was always saying things that can hurt me, make me jealous, and just acting like a total ""douche bag?"", even though she did all this, I never stood up and said anything and I just said to myself that if 

I want to get married to this girl, I should be able to handle her at her worst times, of course all this time I was blaming myself for not making her feel loved and that I'm the reason she did all this and the reason why she stopped loving me that much. but sometimes she would go out of her way and say that she loved me and acted nicely but only a day or two would go by and then she'd go back to being douchy for a 2-3 weeks.

So I saw her about 10 times during this 6 month period and then when I saw her the next time, we started talking about us and marriage etc, and then she starts talking about why I think she had been doing this for the last 6 months, she said that all this time she wanted me to stop loving her and just move on because she had started loving someone else and she was in a relationship with him for about a month and she kissed him (we never kissed btw), and all the time she was just too afraid to tell me this because she thought that i will leave her forever and never talk to her again, but what I did was that I just told her that he cant be in her life ever again and if she wanted me to be with her as a future husband or not, she said yes and that she cant ever imagine her life without me, etc... That was my only reaction, she asked me a week later if i ever regret loving her or whatever and i said no, i never made her feel guilty about it, I just asked for that one thing I said earlier, I also told her that I'm very happy that she was honest with me. Things have went much better after she told me that... and now about 2 months have passed and we're doing alright I guess, we kissed a few times too which i think is good progress. we dont fight a lot, we still talk everyday but not much since we both are busy with our studies..


CURRENT:


Things ""kinda"" changed now and have gotten a little better in my opinion as I have started respecting myself a little more I guess.
Okay I realize I made a few mistakes with not making her feel guilty of cheating that much but I didnt do much about that because she already felt that I guess. I kinda got over it now too.

Okay so let me put things like this, I love her obviously more than she loves me and everyone that knows us (even from her side) knows that I love her way more than she does and did much more for the relationship. Here it goes, lets say I send her a text e.g ""good morning baby"", she replies ""morning baby &lt;3"" 3 hours later, even though she might have been online on some other social media website, its not like this happens rarely, but almost always if I send her a message during the day, it takes her ranging from an hour up to four to respond to a simple good morning. I dont always send her good morning texts to see if she does, she does so like once every 2 weeks, even though her commute to where she's doing her internship is like an hour ride in the train, so she definitely has time to send messages and check up on me. also no one is ever too busy to respond to a text for that long and I know the nature of her internship too. and things are simply not the way I see like I deserve to be treated, every other day she goes home tired from that internship or a little mad cuz of some work during the internship not going the way she wanted it to be, she calls me after 7pm acting all douchy, like she doesnt care and that everything comes and goes and just disagrees with me with anything I say and is always kinda in an offensive stance.

So every once a week or so, ""when she's in a ""good"" mood"" (I know ""good"" is now double quoted, I meant that :P) She doesnt say nice stuff, but when I feel like she's in that mood, I get the courage to say things at the end of the phone call like ""I love you"" and she will say the same thing, Its like I'm always starting the emotionally stuff.

Okay, so now its like I'm desperate for receiving any kind/loving words from her, without really showing it to her though, I never comment on how she didnt text or had any sort of communication with me for the last 18 hours (which happens like 3-4 times a week) or her not responding to text.

Anyways, her birthday is coming up (about a week from now) and I thought of a great plan (12AM Surprise knowing I live 4 hours away, cake, gifts, tons more) for her birthday that her sister and a couple of girl friends of her literally said ""Any girl wouldnt even dream about this"", also her sister said ""she should appreciate you more"" so obviously her sister knows she doesnt appreciate me, so now I'm honestly thinking of her birthday as my last card to make the good version of her show up as I know she's in there :) I know she's gonna be like I want her to be for at least 3 days after her birthday but I'm hoping she doesnt go back to the version I hate, but this time, if she does, I'm gonna ask her to come visit me (4 hours by bus away) and I want to have ""a talk"" with her. I still dont really know what I'm gonna talk about but all I thought of is like.

1- I'm not feeling the love I deserve.

2- I'm putting too much in this relationship and I'm not feeling anything in return. (Trying to start with I's instead of You's :) )

Like for example for my birthday she told me that if her girl friend in my City hadnt told her to come and surprise me and that we'll all spend some good time together and have fun, she wouldnt have came, yep she actually told me that :) but said it in a joking way :) still kinda hurt though, she got me a gift too but lets just say that the birthday she did for me is like 1/100 compared to what I'm gonna do, but lets just put that aside?

3- I want to reconsider a few things?

4- break up maybe? I've always told her I'm not gonna leave her, crap like that, etc though :)


Not really sure what else I can talk about, maybe ask for a break? to make her stop taking me for granted as much as she is taking me now?

So what else can I do/ask/talk about when I ask her to come visit? as I'm 99% sure things arent gonna work out like I want them to after the birthday even though the birthday can change her for the best in my opinion and her friends/family opinions because its really romantic and no one ever did the things I did/gonna do for her.

TL;DR Girlfriend lets say ignores me a lot and sometimes good 18 hours pass by without any sort of communication, ""moody"" behavior? taking me for granted too much? I dont like how things are right now and feel like I'm getting what I deserve. got a plan that can change things, but studying what to do next if things didnt work out like they should, which most probably will not.

Mary Mohane - former White House intern gunned down in a coffee shop. Nothing was taken. It was suspected that she was about to testify about sexual harassment at the White House.

2. Vincent Foster - former White House Counsel, found dead of a gunshot wound to the head and ruled a suicide. He had significant knowledge of the Clintons' financial affairs and was a business partner with Hillary. If the Clintons are guilty of the crimes they are accused of by Larry, Vincent Foster would have detailed knowledge of those crimes.

3. C. Victor Raiser, II - former National Finance Co-Chairman of Clinton for President, and Montgomery Raiser, his son. Both died in a suspicious private plane crash in Alaska. No cause determined. Raiser was considered to be a major player on the Clinton team.

4. Paul Tully - DNC Political Director, was found dead in a Little Rock hotel room. No cause was ever determined and no autopsy was allowed. Tully was a key member of the damage control squad and came up with some of the Clinton strategies.

5. Ed Willey - Clinton fund raiser. Found in the woods in Virginia with a gunshot wound to the head. Ruled a suicide. His Wife went public about a Clinton Groping.

6. Jerry Parks - former security team member for Governor Clinton. Prior to his death he had compiled an extensive file on Clinton's activities. His family had reported being followed and his home broken into just before being gunned down at a deserted intersection.

7. John Wilson - former Washington D.C. council member. Had ties to Whitewater. Died of a very suspicious hanging suicide.

8. Kathy Ferguson - former wife of Arkansas State Trooper Danny Ferguson, the co-defendant with Bill Clinton in the Paula Jones lawsuit. Found dead in her living room of a gunshot wound to the head. Ruled a suicide. Interestingly, her packed suitcases seemed to indicate she was about to go somewhere.

9. Bill Shelton - Arkansas state trooper and fiance of Kathy Ferguson. Allegedly committed suicide by shooting himself at her grave.

10. Gandy Baugh - attorney for Dan Lasater in a financial misconduct case. Supposedly jumped out the window of a tall building to commit suicide

11. Dr. Donald Rogers - dentist. Killed in a suspicious plane crash on his way to an interview with reporter Ambrose Evans-Pritchard to reveal information about Clinton.

12. Stanley Huggins - lawyer investigating Madison Guaranty. Suicide. His extensive report has never been released.

13. Florence Martin - Accountant for the CIA and had information on the Barry Seal case. Three gunshot wounds to the head.

14. Bill Clinton appointed Ron Brown Commerce Secretary, partly as a reward for Ron Brown's success as a campaign fund raiser. From day one, allegations surrounded the exact means and methods by which this success was attained. Investigations into Ron Brown's activities (his son would later plead guilty to money laundering) were nearing the point of indictments, and Ron Brown had publicly stated that he would not go to jail alone, when the airplane carrying Ron Brown and about 30 other people crashed in Bosnia.

Plus many more. If there's some I'm missing I'll update the list

* Very active nightlife (I am 22 years old.)
* Cost of living
* Crime
* Health (such as pollution)

Despite devoting the past few days to reviewing all of the things that I had learned in college (admittedly haven't done any sort of coding for a couple of months since I left my previous job as a software developer), I somehow made my solutions to be a lot more convoluted than they needed to be, and our allotted time ended before I could finish writing out the code for the second problem. During all of this, while I was sure to convey my thought process to the interviewers, I had a mini panic attack where my mind went blank, and spent the majority of the interview time going in the wrong direction with the first problem. 

While the results aren't in yet, I'm pretty sure I failed this one, which while upsetting, is fine; I'm fairly out of practice and really need a lot more work, so I'll get back to the hunt once again. That being said, what are some general take aways that people have received from technical interviews, regardless of whether you actually go the job or failed? Can definitely use whatever tips people may have!"
577hz9,2,2016-10-12,[M4F] TIFU by becoming a [Monster],Gr8fullDominus,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/577hz9/m4f_tifu_by_becoming_a_monster/,"""Ouch!"" I mumbled to myself.  Reaching to the back of my neck, I could feel a welt swelling rapidly; already it was the size of a dime. What the hell bit me?

We are at a precarious point in the excavation, so there was little time to dwell on the fresh wound. In the humid clime of the forest, I'm grateful for the lack of itch.  As the noob intern paleobiologist on the dig, I want to show how hard I work.  Quite frankly, it is frickin' awesome to be included on this project.  No one suspected that embedded in the side of the Adirondacks there would be the 10,000 year old ruins of... well, something. Speculations ran rampant.  Hell, some of the rumors questioned whether or not this was even terrestrial. 

Whatever it is, it is big, and there is a lot of work to do to explore.  The green canopy of leaves were little protection from the hazy, hot, and humids of August. I am drenched in sweat, and I am not alone.  We’re all wilting out here.  I steal yet another look at you, my dig partner.  In spite of the heat, you look particularly fetching today. Beneath your baseball cap, soft tendrils of your hair gently frame your sweet, but intently focused, face. I tried not look down your clingy tank top, but really, those breasts look real and spectacular.   I can’t help but to get lost in the valley of your bosom.

""Are you ok???""

You catch me staring at you. I am embarrassed, but instead of looking pissed or disgusted, your green eyes reflect a look of fear and concern...

Seven minutes later, I awake to you and the rest of the team hovering over me.  I'm embarrassed to have passed out and for effectively ending the dig for the day. I think to myself that this will make an awesome TIFU for Reddit later. 

""Stay still, help is on the way.  I'm right here for you!""

No argument from me.  As you cradle my head, I’m already basking in the bounty of your kindness.  You must be some kind of angel. Maybe this fuck up will be have an upside; maybe this will be transformative and get me to a next level with you. 

""No, really, I feel pretty good, maybe even great.""  Indeed, I feel fantastic. Stronger, confident, and there's something more that I just can't put my finger on.  On the other hand, I won't fuck up twice; I lay still to allow you to protectively fawn over me. 

The rest of the afternoon is a blur. The ER visit, the discharge with a clean bill of health (""probably the heat,"" said the doctor), the ride back to campus, and the entire time, you are at my side. 

Of course, I invite you back to my room for pizza and drinks as gratitude. 

I'm on my second beer, when I first notice the beginnings of the transformation. The welt, having been long forgotten in the chaos of the day, seems larger and harder.  A little itch, and perhaps a little scaly. I ignore it, because things are getting pretty good between us. Really good. 

So far this is the best fuck up ever. We laugh, we talk science, we speculate about the dig. We start kissing. 

Umph.  The feel of your lips against mine is a grand reward for a TIFU afternoon. Who cares that we are still both sticky with the day's grime. You look natural and beautiful.  With my hand on your breast, I can feel the hardness in my pants.  It has been so long for me, my cock feels swollen and larger than life. I pull you to me tightly, and between us I can feel the intensity heat up. 

Soooo hot. Really hot.  Really unbearably fucking hot!  

The sound of screaming is in stereo.  I am burning up and you can feel it.  Our screams are a combination of the shock of being burned and of outright fear. The transformation is unstoppable now.  

We both jump backwards and watch with incredulous horror at what is happening to me.  My skin is rippling, vibrating even, with an electric-red glow.  It is as if my body has been plugged into a nuclear reactor, and my genetics are being reprogrammed with pure energy.  My muscles stiffen with the surge.  Apparently it’s not just my cock that is swollen and hard, but my entire body seems to bulge with pent up strength.   I am changing, but to what.  My mind races… It must be the bite from the dig, but what the fuck?  I run through the mental Rolodex of possible sci-fi scenarios… Insectoid? Reptile? Alien?  Were-creature???  Well, at least I got a large dick.  

I desperately look to you, my sweet beautiful angel.  Help meeee, I mentally scream, but no words come out of my snout.

For a helpless moment, I fight to retain my humanity as the transformation nears climax.  I am becoming some kind of monster.  Today, I really did fuck up.

—————————————————

First person story-building, please.  I would like to have and to be a dirty pen pal.  It would be nice to have a patient and creative female with whom I could exchange paragraphs.  We would go back and forth as we slowly craft a story with erotic kinky fun.

(As much as I’d like to try to Kik this, I don’t have much time now, and quite frankly, I am still a noob with this stuff.  In fact, I would really like to practice creative writing and these Wednesday themes intrigue me.  Trying to get flair is pretty nice, too.)

So.  How does the transformation finish? What kind of monster am I?  Warm and furry and only one friendly penis? Scaly with a sensual, fully-loaded ovipositor?  Gentle sentient giant or mindless brutal inhuman? And how about those tentacles? 

So maybe it could be light and romantic such as some kind of Beast in the Beauty making sweet, sweet monster love.

Maybe it could be humorous like a Beauty and the Beast making some kind of kooky black and white suburban life together.  (Young Frankenstein meets June Cleaver… “Not tonight, dear, I am feeling so stretched out, but could you tell the Beaver that the other hamper is for his socks and poo-poo undies?”)

Maybe kinkier where an ancient alien life form takes over my body, and all I want is to imprison you, ravage you, and fill all your orifices with extraterrestrial cum as part of an impregnation plot; you would be the first of a line of breeding stock.

I’ll even go much darker.  Not my first choice, but maybe it is brutally sinister “vore” situation.  Hmmm.  Nasty, big, pointy teeth, and a viscous streak a mile wide!

No limits on my side, except maybe onions.  Hold the onions.  For me, I’d like to see how adaptive an erotic writer I can be.

Let’s make this Monster Great Again.  

Seriously, I am non-judgemental, and I would welcome any comment, feedback, or play."
577tgk,6,2016-10-12,"Broke up a little over a week ago, should I text him back?",breakupzthrowaway,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/577tgk/broke_up_a_little_over_a_week_ago_should_i_text/,"Hey, I don't have a Reddit account but I needed some advice, I don't know the best way to deal with this situation is...

My ex [20M] broke up with me [19F] from a 7 month relationship two Sundays ago because he said he didn't feel like the timing of our relationship was right. Although we live in the same city, we go to different colleges in that city. We're both quite busy and very focused on internships, studies...basically I think he was in a phase where he didn't feel ready to take on another commitment, and gave me the whole ""it's not you it's me"" rhetoric. After breaking up, I'm feeling pretty solid. Since our lives don't overlap much, it's easy to keep occupied without thinking of him. I almost think he did me a favor in a sense, I think I needed some time to focus on my life and I only realized that post-breakup. I would be lying if I said I never thought of him. I thought we were so compatible and we never fought except on the principle of the whole ""timing aspect"". I do miss him, he was so good to me and you could just tell he was a good guy...I could see potential in the future for us. At the same time, I wouldn't want to get back together with someone at their convenience.

Anyways, to the current situation. So he texted me today in the middle of the day as I was going class to class, saying ""Hey ____, I'm not expecting you to respond to this, but I hope you're doing okay"". I was pretty surprised he texted me so soon after the breakup. I was going the NC route, avoiding watching his snaps (he was watching all of mine), no social media. I haven't blocked him, I've been good about avoiding him, especially because he doesn't post much. I just don't know how to perceive this. It makes me feel pretty good he did it in the middle of the day, which means he's thinking about me not when he's alone laying in bed, but during day to day life. Nonetheless, I don't want to get carried away with fantasies of getting back together, and I don't think I want to get back together for at least the duration of this semester. I won't lie and say I have a little hope for us though, and I don't want him to think I resent him. So should I reply something simple, or just ignore him? 

A little side note...as we had our breakup talk, he said ""You won't have to worry about me dating other girls. If I'm not going to be with you, I'm not going to be with anyone else."" I hate this because it creates an expectation that is always broken at some point. I told him that and told him there are no guarantees I won't have moved on in the near or far future. He accepted it. In times where we have had conversations regarding the timing he asked if I would be around in a year or so...once again, in these times I told him that humans have an amazing talent of moving on, and you can't expect both of us to be available in the future.

But yeah...if I respond, I want to make him know I'm doing well and give no indication of feelings of missing him. Alternatively, I could ignore. I'm just conflicted. Emotions are hard.

--I was offered this internship and who I got the internship I was told that if I i accepted this internship there was a possibility that they would move me somewhere in North America. I told her about this and she didn't seem to thrilled. After being in this internship I have had people hinting that I am going to have a job when I graduate in may, I'm good at what I do.

--Every now and then she will get upset about that fact if she ever had to move, and she has also said that if she ever moved we would have to be married, also she hasn't said it but she has said wouldn't it be nice to get a local job. I live in a small town and a college degree for what I have is no good here.

--I had this idea to tell her, ""It sounds like I'm getting a job in may and they are probably going to have me move, i would like you to come with me, if you like being away from home and don't mind the traveling after a year we can talk about marriage?""

--I'm desperate how i should handle this could someone please give me advice, i love here but i wont want her to make me choose between a opportunity at a good life, or stay with her. That may sound rash but when I say this I want to have a good life with her and my future kids, i want to be able to have the money and security for them...I want better for my kids than I did.

I screwed my cumulative GPA up when I was 18-20 but since returning at 25 I've kept a solid 3.6 in recent course work but still have about a 2.6 cumulative. I still have time to raise this but I would have to receive all A's over the next few years to barely get my cumulative up to about a 3.3. 

How much is this really going to limit my options later on when I'm seeking internships and entry level positions?

I'm a sophomore in the college and studying economics. Backstory: I had a very bad first semester here grade-wise but did a lot better in my second. My first two semesters average out to give me my current GPA of ~2.5. I expect to get good grades this semester since I've changed my study habits since freshman year and became more confident in my work.

The summer after my freshman year I didn't really do anything productive, so I was thinking about finding an internship that matches my career goals for the coming summer. I don't want to have a summer where I don't work on anything again. I think an internship would be a good move for me, but my concern is that my low GPA will hinder me from finding a paid internship anywhere. 

I'd like to know if anyone here has been in the same boat as me before and how their experiences with this issue turned out. In general, does anyone have any tips for someone like me who wants to find an internship but has a low GPA?"
5793g4,114,2016-10-13,"Over-medicated old lady bought the wrong house, wants us to fix it.",attorniquetnyc,talesfromthelaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthelaw/comments/5793g4/overmedicated_old_lady_bought_the_wrong_house/,"Hey all. Just started interning in a new office and got my first dose of crazy today. So I work for a legal services agency in a poor area of a large city as an interning paralegal. Oftentimes, we work out of an office in the county courthouse. My division of our agency handles foreclosure prevention. Normally, people come in after being served with a foreclosure complaint and we help them deal with the bank, apply for loan modifications etc. Our clients are usually decent people who just fell behind on payments due to a variety of circumstances and are very grateful for our help. However, this lady's story was a bit different.

It's early in the morning and the clinic has just opened. From the hallway, I hear the squeaking of a shopping cart round the corner into our waiting area. The prospective client is an elderly Asian woman with a cart full of vegetables. (Why she brought these to the courthouse, I will never know.) I invite her in and sit her down. She has a very thick accent and a less than stellar command of the English language, but I get the drift that she's talking about purchasing a foreclosed house. The supervising attorney emphatically told me that very morning that we were not to work with people seeking to purchase foreclosed homes under any circumstances. I am about to show her the door when she starts talking about suing the mortgagor bank and court-appointed foreclosure referee. At this point, I'm totally lost and get a consult from a staff attorney. We patiently talk to her and try to figure out what the hell she's talking about.

As it turns out, she had in fact purchased a foreclosed home over a month ago at a foreclosure auction in our county. She stated that she currently lives in public housing in a bad part of town and doesn't understand English very well. (No shit, lady.) Then comes the fun part: apparently, she had a doctor's appointment the very morning of the foreclosure auction and was given painkillers at the hospital that ""impaired her judgment."" Despite the language barrier and the Vicodin coursing through her old lady veins, she decided to schlep across town to our county's courthouse to attend the auction anyway. She apparently won an auction, signed a purchase contract for the property and put down an astoundingly large down-payment (something to the tune of $50,000) to secure her spot. So, she gets home (presumably coming down from the painkillers) and realizes that she bought, for just herself and her daughter, an unoccupied triplex in possibly the worst neighborhood in the county. She is now coming to our office to try to have the sales contract annulled and have her down payment refunded on the grounds that she bought the wrong house. She had apparently intended to buy a one-bedroom apartment. -facepalm-

The story doesn't end there, though. Before coming to our clinic, she had tried to sue the bank and foreclosure referee from the past foreclosure case, who, at this point, have no bearing whatsoever in her dilemma. The attorney and I are looking at each other, half bewildered, and half trying to suppress a lopsided grin. We ask her if she had any paperwork, and lo and behold, she pulls out from under her mound of vegetables a photocopy of a handwritten summons and complaint. The handwriting itself was barely legible, but from what we could make out, it was written mostly in broken English and contained no factual allegations other than she was taking medication. She had apparently tried to file it with the court clerk (rejected) and tried to serve it by mail (returned to sender and not an acceptable method of service in our state anyway) on the bank.

The attorney decided to stop this shit-show and informs her that we cannot take her case and stands up to get her a brochure with the number of our county's bar referral service. As he does, she grabs my arm and says ""I no need lawyer. I need only advice. You tell me where I can serve [name of bank]?"" My canned response, ""Ma'am, our organization does not represent home-buyers. The [county name] referral service will connect you with someone who can help."" However, the old lady is persistent. ""Please. I have no money. You can give advice from experience?"" No, lady. No I can't.

Long story short, she ends up wheeling herself downstairs to the bar referral service's office where she will presumably start the whole process over again with another confused intern. Fun times."
5795pc,6,2016-10-13,Being with bf... But someone new is getting in,Jest90,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/5795pc/being_with_bf_but_someone_new_is_getting_in/,"My bf(24) and I(21) have been together for 1yr-10m together. We're monogamous, met this ""new"" guy, and need your opinions based on your experiences, as I feel at risk of messing it up. (Sorry for long post)

Bf is a very nice guy, he's honest, loyal, trustworthy, and patient. We've been through a lot, me going out of the closet, dealing with my/his own parents, him being unemployed, a 5 months time of long-distance relationship, but our love and support has always been reciprocal. He's also my first of lots of things.

Since the start of our relationship, it has been very conflict-driven. Opposite from me, he's a cold person, very pessimistic, jealous, and lacks lots of empathy. Lots of time he doesn't notice the weight of his words and actions, and if these hurt someone else's feelings.

Honestly I have felt uncomfortable with our relationship, like two months from now, since many times I've felt like I have lost the fun of it. I understand it's his personality, and himself accepts he's kind of asocial since he's unlikeable; but though I frequently highlight all his values, sometimes it's just too hard to deal with him as a person. I really make my best to keep this going, but it's really an struggle.

I met this other guy during the time I worked as an intern, I thought he was super handsome when I saw him, and super cool when I shortly met him. I left that place days after and felt kinda relieved since I was crushing *hard* on him... and later, I knew he was gay.

So, 5 months later to now, last Saturday was bar-hopping with bf and friends, when I stepped into him(crush guy). He noticed me and approached me in a flirtatious way(which really surprised me), and asked about adding me on fb. This triggered a jealousy attack on my bf as he noticed in the distance(he knew I had a big crush on him), but I calmed him explaining I never really planned this event.

So, the day after, I simply messaged him(crush guy) saying congrats about his job change, and as a response he starts chatting with me. Long-story-short, he's been totally and evidently flirting with me till today. It's a super awkward and messy feeling for me.

I really, really, want to have a date with crush guy. But I'd never be unfaithful and break the trust my bf has on me. It's totally unfair to have an affair lying to him, and in the past I'd never see myself in this position, but it happened so randomly. I can't help myself over this big crush I have on this guy and the sudden way all things... happened.

I know sudden answer would be ""talk to bf"", but the simple idea of crush guy flirting with me, it's gonna super trigger him and he'll blame me, even though I'll just try to be honest with him and never make any further act without him acknowledging it. It's super frustrating, I feel super tempted because I wanna meet this new guy, but very tested for my own relationship at the same time.

How would you approach it, guys?"
579ism,14,2016-10-13,"Regardless of your trust issues, regardless of where we're both at in life, you're without a doubt the love of my life",Groups,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/579ism/regardless_of_your_trust_issues_regardless_of/,"When we met in college I was dating her. She was the model girlfriend. Headed to med school, same viewpoints as me, but completely judgmental. You were the wild child neighbor, so full of life and such a breathe of fresh air to my stoner lifestyle. You'd stumble to my door at 2 am and we'd just talk until the sun came up. Initially I saw you as an average party girl, but soon realized you were a genius with a laissez-faire attitude towards life, masking a lot of pain. Our bond was holistic, we were perfect compliments to one another. The night I cheated on her (I know, shitty) my desire for you was too strong to ignore. I pinned you against the wall and we had the best sex of my life. I loved every moment until you graduated. I'd give you a ride home, we'd do our thing and then cuddle for hours. You told me I made you feel safe, and even though you claimed to be ""damaged goods"" from your 8 year relationship, I knew I loved you then.


You graduated and we lived in the same city for the summer. Opposite of now, you were the one lost at sea, unemployed and clueless. I was a young intern and felt stable. The night I helped your sister move, the dynamic went to the next level. I reaffirmed that I was the man who wanted to always be there for you, while you showed me your sincere love for your family that you previously masked. That night we ate dinner together on top of packed boxes, where you kept begging me to stay just a little longer even though I had work in the morning. For the rest of the summer, I went to everything. Your family was my family, and I loved it.


Time passed, I went back to school and you found an exciting job 200 miles away. I thought you'd moved on, but quickly learned better. You tweeted ""I wanna talk to you every second of every day, but the thought of never having you again is too much to handle"". You've yet to date anybody else, and when the next ""her"" inevitably came along for me you responded with heartbroken support. When we broke up, you could hardly mask your joy. I'll never forget the night you visited and told me drunkenly that I was your future husband. You told me you love me that night, and you blushed like a schoolgirl when I said it back.



Now, every time we see each other, it's the same routine. You know where my job will be, and its still 200 miles from you. We both keep it together, and then I get drunk enough to basically beg you to take a leap of faith with me. You resist, we fight, because you still have severe trust issues and both of our foreseeable futures career wise are not side by side. You crave stability, yet still won't date countless suitors around you. Likewise, every date I've been on falls flat for the sole reason that they aren't you.



You've drunk dialed me 5 times now from your city, telling me you wish I was there and that we belong together. Each time, you put up your wall of trust the next morning and act like you forgot. When my friend died last week, YOU told ME how I was dealing with it, because you understand me on that level. This past weekend while you were here for the game, I drunkenly told your little sister I'd marry you one day. She responded with ""you have nothing to worry about, you still have her heart"". You're going to Colorado with me this Christmas, and the only thing that's gonna be on my mind the whole time is pinning you against the wall like it's day one.



Without a doubt, no relationship, even one that lasted four years, has come close to how I feel with you. When you're by my side, as cliche as this is, I feel complete. You make me so happy in an otherwise bleak world, and it's painfully obvious to me that if the love of someone's life really does exist, you're it for me. If I won the lottery tomorrow, all I'd want to do is travel the world with you. Even with a great job lined up in my city full of my closest friends, I'm still tempted to give it all up just to get to you instead. More so than that though, I wish you could just trust me with your heart no matter where I end up, because even if it's from a distance you won't find a love like this anywhere else."
579oew,8,2016-10-13,Frustrated with my (22F) + (26M) relationship. Together 9 months.,Amijustneedy,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/579oew/frustrated_with_my_22f_26m_relationship_together/,"I am starting to get really frustrated with my relationship. We've been together for 9 months and for the first 6 months everything was peachy! However since August I have noticed a ""decline"" I would say in our relationship. 

For some background. My boyfriend works full time at a job that requires some physical labour, plays a sport three times a week (the same one as me) and also does unpaid intern style work with a professor at the university in our town. I work two part time jobs that work out to 30-35 hours a week, and also play the same sport three times a week. So all in all, we both can be busy. Him much more than me.

Anyways, since August, I've noticed my boyfriend seemed to be waiting for me to plan our dates, ideally I would like to hang out twice a week, but unless I said something he wouldn't ask me. So I confronted him, told him it was important to me if he took control a little bit on this more, he said he doesn't see this as a big deal, but would try. He also would rarely text me first (not the biggest issue but I feel like a nag now to get his attention) and often not reply for hours. 
Again, asked him about it, he said he's busy at work so he can't text much during the day anyways. And its a not a big deal to him so he doesn't see it as an issue. 

He's been going through some stressful times, like for example the professor and him has a fallout for some weeks and he was sure he ruined a really good thing until they made up; had to move on short notice due to his house becoming unlivable, and workload increasing to be able to afford new living situation.

 So I get that he's been stressed and busy but I'm starting to feel at the bottom of his list. We had a big talk about that and he was telling me its ridiculous for me to feel like that just because he can't stop everything hes doing to hang out with me. I said I wasn't asking him to stop everything but when he was the free time it'd be nice if he reached out to me FIRST instead of him waiting for me. So since then its been okay, I'd say he asks to come over once a week. Still rarely texts but whatever I've started to not let it bug me. 

Some things that do bug me: My dog died some weeks ago, when he asked what he could do to help me I just said all I wanted was a hug. He didn't reply for some hours and I finally called him and he said he was out with a friend and was doing some work. I again repeated what I wanted from him when he first asked and he said he didn't want to come over because my family and I were grieving and it would awkward and out of place for him to just show up. I agreed with that. And said I wanted to go over to his house, and he replied I could but he was doing work and couldn't ""entertain me"". I told I didn't fucking care I just wanted some fucking comfort from my boyfriend and I could watch TV on his couch till he was done. So I had to ask my boyfriend to comfort me. 

Most of the time I realize if I don't reach out to him about these things they would never happen. It feels like he doesn't want me around. But he's reassured me that's not the case and hes just honest to god busy with the ""school"" work he doing. Lately he's been sick as well and just so tired all the time so our sex life has dropped to once a week. Which isn't the biggest issue but its driving me a little nuts. 

Anyways. How do I once again explain to him my needs? I feel like I've already told him what I need/want out of the relationship and our situation isn't going to change. He's always told me that what we have is a good thing and were different and blah blah but I'm putting all the effort in and most days just feel defeated and like a joke to him. Even though he's told me I'm not. He's also never really told me what he wants. Should I start a conversation about our needs again? How would I bring that up? 

I should also mention this is my first """"""serious"""""""" relationship outside of highschool so I really don't have much experience. :(

TL;DR: need more out of my relationship even though ive told my boyfriend many times what I want. How do I get this across to him."
57av1a,35,2016-10-13,My SO [26 F] resents me [28 M] for hurting her years ago and is having trouble letting it go,throwaway46402,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/57av1a/my_so_26_f_resents_me_28_m_for_hurting_her_years/,"Hey r/relationships, I could really use your advice!

I met my SO, Dana, 6 years ago while I was doing an internship in her country. We dated for a few months, but since the internship was for a fixed period of time and I had no intention to settle there, I always looked at the relationship through that angle even though I really liked her.

While I'd had a few girlfriends prior to Dana, she was very inexperienced and I was her first everything. She was devastated when I left her country and wanted a LDR, which I declined. For a while we were sort of on-and-off. We visited each other every once in a while and went on trips together.

We broke up and I tried to remain friends with her, but she was contacting me daily. Since I was firmly opposed to LDR and was looking to meet people and have a social life, I felt the healthiest option was to go no contact for some time.

Dana entered into a deep depression when she realized I was seeing other people. But eventually she was able to move on and ended up meeting someone else. During this time, she got into a very competitive grad school in my city. Before she left, she broke up with him after about 9 months of dating. 

She arrived about a month ago to start her program and we have been inseparable since. We are in an exclusive relationship and things have been generally been going great between us, but I can see she is feeling some resentment towards me because of what happened in the past.

Having watched her go into a deep depression because of me, her family back home is very concerned that she's with me. I can't say I blame them. Even though Dana admits her depression wasn't my fault, it was still because of me and she feels a lot of resentment towards me as a result. 

She acknowledges there are issues on her end and was working with a therapist back in her country, but I don't think she is seeing anyone currently. As she is a student, seeing someone here could be tough for her financially. To complicate things, I am recently unemployed, but may be able to pay from my savings if that's what it will take for her to get over this. But I'm not sure if it would help. She had been seeing someone for years back home but evidently it didn't work.

Any advice, r/relationships, aside from getting her back into therapy?

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: SO and I have been on-and-off until she moved to my city. It turns out she had been in a deep depression because refused to be in a committed LDR before and now resents me because of it. What do?"

You can see my posting history about the Thanksgiving debacle last fall that ended up with cops being called to escort me through her house to get my things, since I didn't trust her or my dad to either threaten to beat me up, cause a psychotic break, or both (or threaten to institutionalize me).

Since then, I got back in touch after a very passive-aggressive message on facebook re: her engagement to her now-third husband that she only tagged me in and let me see. I congratulated her, and we do talk only via facebook chat. It makes her nice since she knows I can screenshot at any time and post it for all of her (equally narc) sisters to see, and she doesn't want that. I'm playing nice mostly because I want to keep my insurance through her for now, but also because I have a hard time letting go because she's my mom. She's very good at love bombing and reminding me of the not-abusive times growing up.

**The problem:**
SO and I recently bought a newer car because the repairs on my first car (that I owned solely, had to badger NMom to get her off the title so she would stop threatening to take it away and/or report it as stolen) were getting to be too much for such an older vehicle. However, we want to get it licensed in our home county because a.) they're willing to carry over the registration I paid on the old car and b.) the sales tax is much, much lower. 

I will not be staying with her this time (as of the time of this post, she does not know I'm coming). However, I feel extremely guilty that I haven't seen her face-to-face in a year and feel compelled to see her, as I already Matrix-dodged her visiting the town that I was doing my internship in. Do I meet with her in a public place while I'm up there? Or should I just be stealthy and get the car stuff done and get out?

SO (who has to deal with her as a MIL) is suggesting not to, and he thinks I'm just going to be sucked back into the cycle of abuse."

57b1vf,1,2016-10-13,How to improve myself?,improvingEveryday1,asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/57b1vf/how_to_improve_myself/,"Hi askTRP, I am 23 year old student in my final year. I need help. I am an average guy with average looks/intelligence. I have to work hard to understand ideas and concepts I study(computer science). I put a lot of effort into bettering myself in this field but having found TRP and PurplePillDebate realized that I am not happy. In fact, I am rather miserable.

I have mild to moderate depression that stems from: not being satisfied with my career choice(I am okay at computer science(top 10%) but it is not my element. I enjoy it though), lack of friends and social networks, subpar appearance, lack of female attention, social isolation etc.

I find that as a male, I am not special and want several core things in life: being on a career path I like or at least tolerate well, female attention and sex, healthy body and mind and more free time.

I find my appearance to be a limiting factor because we are attracted to beautiful people and maximizing looks is important. Since September 1st, I lift 6 times a week on PPL split. In addition, lifting resolves around 20% of my depression. I cook at home, measure my food and count calories. Looking at myself in the mirror, I could honestly say ""I'd fuck me."" except that my face sucks. I have active acne, scars and acne on my shoulders, upper back. Even my mother said that I'd be rather handsome but my non-clean face disadvantages me a lot. I have yet to find anything to work for my skin issues. I used benzoyl peroxide, some antibiotics from doctors but they did not make my skin much better. Really need advice.

I also think my wardrobe sucks. Recently, a friend came back from internship in New York and he changed. He wore rather formal clothes that looked so fucking well on him, first thing I asked was whether he was going back from somewhere formal. But nah, it is his regular clothing now. It was night and day difference between regular jeans and hoodie and current clothing.

As a result of being ""not conventionally attractive"", I don't have friends and females are not interested in me except girls that are 4s or 5s. And even then it is quite rare. This results in social retardation and long periods of social isolation. However, despite being introvert I enjoy talking to people. It's just that I am boring, uglyish guy and people don't remember me. I'd go to parties and events but no one invites me.

I firmly believe that my depression, lack of confidence could be significantly improved by solving skin issues, wardrobe modifications. Also, I'd like to add that having performed excellently in my internship I did not get a return offer because of my shitty social skills and lack of personality. I'd like to improve on that because it hinders my career, options with women etc.

In conclusion, do you guys have advice on maximizing appearance? I found male fashion advice having lots of content but I am really bothered by my skin issues and could use some advice. Depression can only be lifted by boosts of confidence of real accomplishments. I can already feel results from the gym and now need to keep going on fixing other issues."

I am now selling Fray-X, a product that protects the weakest joint on MacBook Power Adapters. It works for any MacBook laptop charger. It is $6.99, which is cheaper than any competitor on the market (but works as well, if not better) and way cheaper than buying a new power adapter.

Huge shoutout to Ultron, who designed the website. He exceeded my expectations and did an amazing job in a short amount of time.

I highly recommend getting one if you are a MacBook user, and will even include a hand drawn tagpro picture for you if you say that you want one in the order comments :D

57csme,0,2016-10-13,Critique my routine,SilenceLikeLasagna,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/57csme/critique_my_routine/,"As a preface, I'm a student at a pretty work-intensive university, going through the process of internship recruiting right now - I'm training with the principle of minimum time spent in the gym, and spending it lifting hard and heavy for maximum efficiency. 

That being said, stats are the following:
Male
5'7
158 pounds

Max lifts for context (currently have an injured shoulder so haven't been able to progress on bench or OHP, have been able to moderately do dips)
Squat: 345 (5x5)
Deadlift: 375 (1RM)
Weighted chin-ups: 45 (5RM)
Weighted dips: 75 (5RM)

I started off with Stronglifts and made fantastic gains doing so. However, as my squat and deadlift numbers rose, it felt too taxing to hit those heavy in a single workout. My current routine is a modified version of the program, starting off each workout with two strength exercises and finishing with a third exercise with a superset and minimal rest time for some cardio-esque work. I lift every other day:

Day 1:
Deadlift 3x5
Weighted chin-ups 3x5
Front squats 5x5, SS standing dumbell shoulder press (lighter weight with 45 second rest times) 

Day 2:
Squats 5x5
Weighted Dips 3x5
Bent-over rows, SS dumbbell lateral raises 5x5 (lighter weight, 45 seconds of rest between sets)

Once again, trying to be as time-efficient as possible, primary goal being strength and secondary focus on muscle. Normally would do a SL-esque adding of 5 pounds per workout, but I'm currently trying to cut so I'm maintaining the heavy squats at a 5x5 at 315 pounds and the deadlifts at a 3x5 at 335 pounds.

Would love to hear input on how it might be lacking! Just wanna be strong and healthy :)"
57dali,1,2016-10-13,25 year old gay man severely depressed,russd27,depression_help,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/57dali/25_year_old_gay_man_severely_depressed/,"I was raised as an only child in an middle/upper class family and was given many toys and fun things. At around the age of 16, my parents were going through a very nasty divorce where police were called. This was happening right during the 2007-2008 recession. My father lost his high paying job and many lawyers were involved to settle the house, and my mothers alimony. It happened so that she won the case and has been squeezing every last drop of money out of him to this present day. The immense stress I had to endure was unbelievable. I remember at that time gaining up to 300lbs in weight being 6'2"" in height. Upon settlement, I knew my quality in life was going to change a bit, so I busted my ass to lose 100lbs and go to school for mechanical engineering upon graduating high school. I completed my bachelors in engineering with some internship experience and found a product engineering position at an engineering company last year (2015). I was laid off from that position last june and have been struggling to find employment in my field. What really gets to me is when I see all my colleges holding great jobs, and none of them do anything to help me find one. Frankly I now regret going into engineering as I really fucking hate the industrial world! It depresses the shit out of me. At this point I am getting back into the piano as I consider myself quite accomplished at it. My goal at this point is to perform and concerts, malls etc, but this is definitely going to take time for me to brush up on it. Being gay also just elevates my stress! I have never been in a relationship my entire life and dont know what to do at this point. I have no job, and no one to come home to. Its as if Im living in prison of perception. Whenever Im with one of my gay friends who are already is in a relationship of their own, some shit seems to go down. Alot of times there will be another guy that will message me from a site or what not, I will be with one of my friends, go meet the new guy, and then he will end up saying ""I think your friend is hot!"" right to my face! and then make a move on him! :(  Its kind of like at this point I hope nuclear war breaks out and the whole species goes extinct. I mean we are seriously a fucking joke with the way we act  by treating one another with arrogance and having no empathy for mother nature. I am seriously disgusted to be an incarnated being on this planet! It provides you with zero hope of actually becoming someone unless if you are fortunate enough to be born into a wealthy family! If the planet were to be destroyed, I would never have to worry about incarnating into this hell hole ever again! "
57dc6g,6,2016-10-13,"My [23F] long-distance boyfriend [25M] is becoming... distant. I am confused, sad, and upset. How to proceed?",confusedLDRgf,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/57dc6g/my_23f_longdistance_boyfriend_25m_is_becoming/,"It was hard to think of a good title that was concise and conveyed the situation I'm in, so please read. There will of course be a TL;DR at the bottom.

I want to preface this post with the fact that my boyfriend is selfless, kind, funny, ambitious, and affectionate. I wouldn't be with him if he wasn't. I was really hesitant to post this here because a trend I see in this sub is for hurt/scorned parties to post only the negatives about their partner only to have them be dragged through the mud in the comments. I need advice from a neutral third party to help process my emotions, so if any of post makes my boyfriend sound like an asshole, he isn't.

So where to begin? I guess you could say I'm your typical Redditor. All throughout college, while my friends were juggling dating with their classes, I was instead chasing publications, research, studying, and internships. I had never had a relationship before meeting David, so all of this is fresh to me. An ideal Friday night for me is to get home after a long week and get lost in a good game/TV show and forget about people.

But like all people, I have sexual urges. I've had a lot of casual sex throughout my youth and don't regret it. Most of it was done through random bar flings or Tinder. So, cue a Friday night where I'm feeling ""excited"" and a bit bored and I open up Tinder to find that I've matched with a rather attractive man. It was all fairly routine. He invited me over to ""watch a movie"" after some heavy flirting and I went to his house. I arrived to a decent house in a good neighborhood with a nice car in the driveway. I'm primarily interested in the physical wellbeing of a guy I'm going to be solely hooking up with, but this was a sign that he had his shit together. He opened the door and he was fucking hot! I've had instances where people's pics don't necessarily match up 100% with the reality, but he looked even better in person than in the pics.

We had a few beers, as is par for the course, and actually had a pretty good conversation. He was funny and had a quick wit, and we even speak the same language and come from the same ethnic background. When we finally did the deed, it was amazing! It was like we had been doing it for years. The pillow talk/cuddling was nice too. When I got home, he texted me asking if I'd like to go out for dinner the next night to which I agreed.

From there, things just happened really fast! We spent a ton of time together at each other's houses (not only for sex), met each other's friends, did a lot of things together, shared video games and TV shows with each other, etc. We hadn't made it ""official"" but we were pretty much dating at that point. It was the first time I had felt ""feelings"" like that for a guy. Previously, I had only ever had platonic friends or quick hookups, but we had great chemistry going on.

Unfortunately, all good things must come to a close sometime. I got a great job opportunity right out of college that was perfect for me. It was in my field, directly related to what I had studied, had a good starting pay, and was located in a cool part of a huge city... four hours away. While I should have been ecstatic at the prospect of being offered something like it, I was also sad that the fun times with David (which had been going on for six months at that point) would be coming to a close.

He was very happy for me, but also sad that we wouldn't be physically together for the coming future. Again, while we never made things ""official"" we were pretty much BF/GF without the title; neither one of us had ever just sat down and talked with each other about it. We kept in contact every day while I moved, and actually visited each other every weekend, alternating between who did the drive. It was tough, but we managed to keep the spark alive.

Fast forward to me excelling at my new career and I'm offered the opportunity to work in Spain for the next six months. This is a huge boost to my career, which I accepted. David and I had a long talk where we admitted that we loved each other (!!!) and would stay together while I was abroad. The caveat was that I would transfer to the branch office in our home city upon my return. This has been the plan since I left.

Fast forward to today where we are having issues and I am feeling so confused and lost. Life here in Spain has not been easy for me. I speak some Spanish, but not fluently, and haven't really made many friends here. David has been my rock while I've been here. We talk/FaceTime/Skype every day, and just hearing his voice and having him tell me that I'm kicking ass (even when I'm not) has been giving me the strength to get through these last few weeks.

He's come to visit me twice already and both times have been fantastic. I take him around, we talk about everything under the Sun, have great sex, and generally act like we did back home. I have six weeks until I return home to David and we can start a ""normal"" relationship, and this very idea is what has been propelling me forward. These last few weeks have been KILLER and I just honestly can't wait to get the fuck out of here.

This past few weeks David has been acting very... distant. He sometimes won't answer his phone during the set times I call him and when I do get a hold of him, he doesn't sound very enthusiastic to talk to me. I was having a very tough day at work the other day, so when he didn't answer his phone (after we had set a SPECIFIC TIME to talk), I got a little crazy and called him over and over. I eventually called his best friend, and lo and behold, David was right there next to him ignoring my calls. David got upset with me and told me to stop blowing up my phone and that he would call me when he could.

Well, that phone call was today. My mind is a whirlwind right now, and I'm having a hard time summarizing what he was telling me, but the gist is that the distance has been so hard from him, that he wants to be platonic friends from here on out and ""maybe"" rekindle the romance somewhere down the line. His rationale is that because I was such an open kind of girl, and had so much casual sex before I met him, that I was doing a disservice to myself by tying myself down to him while I young and in a foreign country. I'm honestly a little insulted. I feel like he's implying that I've been lusting after these Spanish men but only restraining myself out of courtesy to him. That is certainly not the case! I love him and only want him! I explained this to him, but he said that I didn't know what I was talking about because I'm young and this is my first relationship.

Reddit, I have six fucking weeks left in this country. I have been looking forward to going home for so long now, with a huge part of this being going back to David and having a real relationship. I feel like everything I've invested into this has just been pulled out from under me and I am a mess. I'm an educated professional who is letting some guy make her cry and contemplate ending her work assignment early just to fly home! I don't want to be his friend, I want to be his girlfriend! I want to cuddle with him, take cute pics for Facebook, and fuck his brains out, not just smile and play video games with him! We didn't get to continue the conversation because his boss interrupted him, but he's going to call me back later tonight (if he decides to). I don't know how I'm going to talk to him without crying and pathetically begging him to still love me. This past year with him has been one of the best, funnest, happiest years of my life, and I don't want it to end. How can I explain to him how much he means to me and that I don't want to be his friend?

TL;DR: MY long distance boyfriend is telling me he wants to be just friends six weeks before we're about to start a life together. How can I move forward from here?"
57e034,3,2016-10-13,All the Pretty Things,bigfatbino,DarkTales,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/57e034/all_the_pretty_things/,"The first of the sounds was really quite faint. I heard it coming through the cracked open window in my classroom. The subsequent tones escaped me, since immediately at the sound of the tolling belltower the classroom erupted into activity and cheers. Classroom doors flew open, followed by organized chaos throughout the campus as locker doors opened and slammed shut. Elevators creaked and squealed, stopping at every floor going up or down, bearing students and faculty alike from warm classrooms to the brisk chill of a fast-approaching winter.

Today was especially busy; the air itself seemed charged with anticipation as the crowds departed campus. This was the last day of school before the winter break began. Many would be traveling home to see family and friends with the hope of being able to stuff themselves so full of turkey and other goodies that the stress of essay writing and final exams would melt away into sweet oblivion. On my way to the elevator, I noticed a nice new bulletin was posted on the community announcements board. I always made it a point to keep up on the new postings to the community board, mostly just because I wanted to read something other than a textbook. It also afforded me the opportunity to steal stray thumbtacks for later rubberband-launching. I won’t tell campus security if you don’t…. This particular posting was headlined:

“Winter Break Community Intern/Apprenticeship Opportunities; learn something fun and new!”

Listings for “intern”, “apprentice” and “entry-level” positions offered by attorney offices, plumbers, even radio and TV internships filled the page, all offering exposition in a respective craft, presumably designed to help coax new talent into a field. Many of the internships were unpaid, offering “valuable experience” as their reward. Several of the “opportunities” charged a fee for providing tools or other materials. I chuckled at the page, marveling at how there always seemed to be a hundred ways for money to depart a wallet, but very few ways for it to get in there. I began to turn away from the board and rejoin the bustling flock of migrating students, when something caught my eye near the bottom of the page

“Eternal Keepsakes” Jewelers Apprentice: mini-internship with master-craftsman. Experience classic techniques and make your own!

I had always been interested in making jewelry. My family came from a long line of model-makers, sculptors, and artists of some sort or another, and I had always liked the thought of making my own jewelry pieces. I pulled the last tab that had the contact information on it, and put it in my wallet. This was worth serious consideration.

A few days and a hangover or two later, the revelry of the Christmas season was well under way, evidenced by the endless onslaught of “Happy Holidays” and “Sale, Sale Sale!” signs in every shop window. And I was already bored and tired of it all. I suppose it was chance that when “Silver bells” came on for what seemed the millionth damned time, I was going down the list of things that they could have sung about other than damned bells, muttering to myself in tones of rapt boredom and early holiday exhaustion;

“Silver Bells, Silver spoons, Silver spurs, Silver …jewelry.” I stopped and remembered the piece of paper neatly tucked into my wallet. I pulled it out and looked at it while my mind pondered the possibilities. I could just hang out and enjoy myself for the next three weeks and not really worry about having to do anything or be anywhere. But on the flip side of that coin, pissing a break away on booze, boredom, and pizza box collecting was not the best way to spend it. Might as well do something new! II picked up the phone and dialed the number in the ad. It rang once on the other end of the line:

“Eternal Keepsakes, Dan speaking. Hello Brian calling about the internship?” a man’s voice answered the phone, and caught me a bit off guard. I hadn’t expected the phone to be answered so quickly, or have a total stranger know my name and why I was calling. I paused awkwardly, and let out a perplexed and weirded out “uhhhh.”

I heard a chuckle, followed by “Caller ID says Brian Cooper. And my phone hasn’t rand so much in the past 30 years as it has in the last few days since I put those flyers out. Most ask about the internship right before they start fishing for discounts on presents. So is it discounts or the internship you’re after?” Guy was to the point and sharp as a razor, but had a good-natured tone to him, the kind that your friends would heckle you with before getting the next round of drinks.

“Hi, yeah this is Brian, and yes I’m interested in the internship.”

“Ok, well then here’s the deal. I’ve said no to everyone so far since I felt they were fishing for cheap jewelry. So if I take you I need you to not go blabbing that you got the gig, that’ll make my life complicated if things get around. Also this is an everyday activity, you have to be here 7 days a week, even if it’s only for an hour. Just like practicing a musical instrument. At the end you’ll have your own piece that you can keep forever or vice versa! Sound good?” We talked a bit more, and he put me at ease with his light hearted and slightly irreverent banter, assuring me that he had every certification in the craft, including experience that went back since “Before Noah was a zoo-keeping sailor in that little cruise ship!”

I grabbed a pen and scrawled the directions he gave me onto my hand. “2409 East Walnut St., entrance around back, got it. See you tomorrow Dan.” I said, repeating Dan’s directions. His shop was just about four miles from me, if my phone maps app was worth a shit. Tomorrow would be a good day, IF I got my ass in gear and got the laundry done. I hadn’t done laundry or dishes in nearly a week. I had taken a liking to the small neighborhoods of the Northern district in the city of Roses, the nickname stemming from the wild rose bushes that grew all over the place. Many of the streets were lined with old trees, and most of the houses were built well before the “cookie cutter” developments of today.

English Tudors with front-yard rose gardens shared borders and fences with southwest mission style homes, complete with cast iron bells and tall eucalyptus trees. I often meandered around for hours admiring the side streets. Yards were kept up, any dogs I saw were leashed, walking with their owners down the sidewalks, “scoopers” in hand to cleanup any messes, and friendly waves were freely given. How inviting it all was. Luckily for me, my admittedly rather long walk from my place to Dan’s took me all the way through the nice neighborhoods. I had not yet ventured this far north before, so it was nice to strike out early and cover some new ground.

When I turned onto Walnut St, I was in the 1600 block, probably just a mile or two from my destination. I counted the blocks passing as I got closer to my destination. By the time I reached the 2000’s, the charming neighborhoods had long faded into the distance, and the horizon presented only a few run-down houses here and there. Warehouses and empty lots dotted the sides of the road, and the faint bouquet of diesel trucks and garbage quickly replaced the smell of eucalyptus and roses.

I passed a large wrought iron gate and a huge dog appeared from under a low wooden deck and lunged at me. As he hit the gate, the metal creaked and squealed, the force of it sending hot drool from his jaws onto my forearm, the cold air making his breath seem more suited to a dragon than a canine.

“SHIT!” I half-shrieked, jumping back from the gate and pausing to read the engraved sign on it:

“Beware of Dog, no soliciting, proceed at your own risk!”

“No shit.” I answered the sign, and took a much quicker gait to the end of the house, only then halting to stoop down and wipe dog drool off my arm while I could still get a look at the mut. My composure slowly returned. “Sonuvabitch! Damned Mutt! …Just my damned luck, his jeweler’s shop had to be in the fertilizer district of the city of Roses.” I muttered aloud, half to myself, and the rest of it directed at the dog and his neighborhood.

A few more blocks passed, and I found my destination on the right. An old brick building with a large glass window had faded gold-colored lettering “2409 E. Walnut St.” below the address the name “Eternal Keepsakes; fine crafts.” The roof of the place was a nice shake-shingle material, and though the bricks showed considerable age, it looked as though the place had been kept up as well as could be expected. The place must have been at least 90 years old I guessed, simply because nobody built anything out of pure brick, stone, and mortar like this anymore, except perhaps for mausoleums and monuments. A thin wisp of smoke crept from a chimney around the back of the small building.

I walked down the slim driveway to the left of the small storefront to the back as instructed and opened the small wooden gate with the “entrance” sign on it. The only gate situated between the brick walls that bordered the property. No sooner had the gate clacked shut, and I heard a voice emanate from an open, curtain less window near the back porch door. I saw a brief slender shadow move through the window.

“Who comes?” The voice called loudly , sounding a life-long smoker who was caught half choking, as though a gulp of water had gone down the wrong pipe in a mis-swallow.

“It’s Me, Brian, am I too early?” I called back, shouting at the building, maybe a little too loud, but at least Dan would hear me through the brick walls. “Nah, You’re just in time. Come on in, door’s open.” I then recognized Dan’s voice right away. At least I wouldn’t walk in to find him half-dead and choking on the floor, talk about a bad way to start an apprenticeship.

I walked up the few stone steps to a brick archway and door with a single dull-yellow bulb for an entry light. The door to the back of the shop itself was impressive. It was made of solid oak planks, with cast iron binding and hinges. Just above the doorway, there hung a set of intricate handmade wind chimes. Several forged copper butterflies hung suspended from silverish thread or wiring, spinning slowly and gently on their wires. Some were very green with age; others were a bit newer looking, with just a hint of greenish-copper patina. The striker was a large spider, from some kind of alloy that gave it a mirror shine and also made it impervious to any sign of wear from the elements, below it hung a large counterweight with intricate but shallow inscriptions I could not make out.

I reached for the door and pressed the thumb latch down and it swung open, without so much as a creak from the hinges. As I closed the door, I heard the wind chimes sound faintly, a butterfly or two clanging against the cast-metal spider. I didn’t feel any kind of breeze on the back of my neck. It must have been the vibration from me opening the door. I stepped into the shop and the door closed behind me with a loud “Thu-Clank.”

“Hey Brian, great to see you! I’m Dan, short for Daniel Mammon.” A short and stubby man, who I could best describe as the lost Hippie Love child of Willie Nelson and Santa Claus appeared from behind a large blacksmith’s forge in the middle of the room. He was mostly bald, save for a small ring of thin white hair around the back of his head, falling into a short and wiry gray beard. He wore a thick leather apron on top of a blue shirt, black jeans, and black leather boots which showed so much wear, it would not have surprised me one bit if they had been made before beer led to bar fights. He wore earrings, about 5 of them in each ear, had at least a half-dozen different necklaces with gems, and charms on them. On the middle finger of each hand he wore a ring, silver on the right, gold on the left, with quite intricate carvings on each. He walked over to a small jewelry counter on the right side of the shop, clutching a beer bottle in one hand and some business looking papers and pen in the other.

“Let’s get the red-tape Bullshit out of the way first, whaddaya say?” he placed the papers and pen on a glass countertop of a jewelry case and made a “come hither” motion, beer still in hand. As I walked over, he took a loonnnggg pull from the bottle, drinking at least half of the beer in a few seconds. He followed this with a wall-shaking belch and laughed. I liked this guy already.

“Sounds good to me, sir.” I said, a smile coming to my face. I grabbed the pen and started reading through the papers fine print and all.

“Bah! Don’t call me ‘Sir’, makes me think my ol’man is gonna walk through the door!” Dan joked, and finished chugging his beer. He reached under the counter and opened a small mini-fridge, and grabbed another beer, cracking it open and taking a good solid pull. His breathe reeked of alcohol, and I knew he was probably impaired to no end. Hell I almost got drunk from the vapors he exhaled.

“Dammit Bud, we’ll be here all night. Lemme summarize that crap for you. I agree to demonstrate, you agree to learn, and if you get hurt, it ain’t my fault, so don’t sue me. Now c’mon, sign your life away and let’s get going!” Dan said, somewhat joking yet impatient, as though he would have rather been at the dentist for a root canal than deal with paperwork. “Hell, sounds ok to me.” I laughed and smiled, eager to get on Dan’s good side. I scanned through the paperwork quickly. I scrawled my finest “apprentice-worthy” signature onto the parchment and he turned to me and with an almost gleeful look on his face he said;

“Right on! Ok Bud, Let’s get your tools and get started.”

“Ok so we know not to go blabbing, and we know to be here everyday. Beyond that, the only rules are don’t touch the billows and fire or any other equipment, or my beer. I don’t want you burning my place down, and I especially don’t want you doing it if you’re more buzzed than me!” Dan slapped me on the shoulder and finished his admonishment with a throaty laugh and beer breath that would choke an alcoholic. He handed me a small canvas container.

“Here’s your tools. You do a good job, and you can have those too.”

“Thanks! I’ll give it my all!” I replied, smiling, and now secretly wondering if there was also a rule about me bringing my own beer, but I decided to keep that question to myself.

The shop itself wasn’t really much at all. There was the back of the shop where Dan kept much of his equipment, a few small jewelry shelves on the driveway side of the shop to the right of the backdoor as I stood in it, a bathroom to the left which was in a state of questionable sanitation. The main jewelry display case for customers was in the front of the store facing Walnut St.

The highlight of the shop was the forge and billows, The large stone forge seemed as though it were made from a single large boulder, hollowed out with an impressive stone façade surrounding it, serving as both a hearth and workbench for Dan, and as a fire-stop in case something came out of the furnace a little too hot to handle and needed to be quickly dropped. A large stone chimney extended upward through the roof. The whole building seemed to have been built around the forge itself. I could see how this shop had at some point possibly been a blacksmith’s hutch many years past. A small workbench sat in the back of the shop, which became my workstation. I could see just enough of the front entrance get a good view of the door and could alert Dan about any customers entering from the back, though I had never seen anyone there but Dan and myself.

The next two weeks flew by. I learned just about everything there was to know about wax, clay, alloys, casting, polishing, hammering, and shining jewelry pieces. The main thing I learned was ring-making, stamping intricate sheet, and soldering. “With these skills, you can make 99% of what’s out there.” Dan would say. All my work had to be perfect before I could move to the next “level.” “Heating the fires a degree” he called it. By the time I had ring-making down, I barely noticed the old burns I had sustained in the process. Even the new burns didn’t bother me much, it was just part of the gig. By the end, stamping any sheet into any shape and soldering them all together was easy. I even showed off to Dan by soldering two pieces of aluminum foil gum wrapper together. For a split second, my Master looked impressed. But only for a split second and in a breath it was back to work.

I started spending more and more time in the shop Admittedly, I did this partly because I was really enjoying what Dan had to teach, and also because it was nice and warm in the shop, thanks to Dan’s ever-burning furnace. No matter how many feeble space heaters I put in my apartment, there was no matching the radiant heat of the forge.

By the time my third week had started, Dan had begun teaching me how to scribe artful scripts into ring blanks, leaving enough room for a name to be engraved on a finished cast. It was a form of precision wax engraving I truly admired. He called his script “pretties.” because the term “bling” was too “god-damned millennial generation”, or so he claimed. Personally I didn’t think a jeweler had any business dismissing anything for being “too materialistic”, but that was just me. All of his work had these intricate designs of loops, swirls, lines and curves carved into the wax patterns. The markings themselves were finer than the finest of any calligraphers pen stroke, it was a marvel to behold such skill. With the exception of the times when he was showing me a technique or giving me good natured but thorough criticism of my work, Dan was always working, most of the time on adding to his beautifully engraved butterfly wind chimes, which he called “his prettiest of pretties.”

Despite his perpetual beer-in-hand status, Dan moved with absolute mastery of his instruments. Any time I came by, the furnace was blazing; he had the billows and the forge working. Dan was always busy working on a piece, and I never once saw him make any kind of mistake. I kept practicing and practicing, and finally I handed Dan my latest ring that I had scripted with Dan’s Hippie “pretties” pattern and he inspected it. He raised an eyebrow and looked at me, “Now by the fires I think you’ve got it. This is good work here!” he gleefully slurred. I think you’re just about ready! He turned around and put it onto his workbench, all the while mumbling to himself. I caught the words “pretties” or “keepsake”. He glanced at the clock and back at me and raised his eyebrows.

“Wow its late Bud, I lost track of time. Finish up and head-on out.” I thought this was a little odd, since I had now been coming to the shop everyday for nearly twelve hours a day. After cleaning up my bench from it’s daily collection of wax-shavings, and dust, I grabbed my coat and headed for the door.

“See you tomorrow Dan,” I said over my shoulder, stepping out from the warm shop into the chilly stillness of the evening air. Behind my back I heard him say

“Tomorrow if not sooner bud!”. The door clicked behind me and I started the walk home.

As I was passing under the archway, I heard the faint jingle of the windchimes. This time it seemed odd to me, as I had not slammed the door on my way out, nor was I stomping my feet around. There was not even the faintest hint of a breeze in the air. I turned to look, remembering I had wanted to have a closer look at Dan’s craftsmanship of this marvelous piece. On the counterweight below the spider, I looked closely at an inscription etched upon the band. The inscription was surrounded by Dan’s trademark “pretties” design and the text itself was almost imperceptible from the script, but I made it out. It read; “All the pretty things I keep”. I reached to have a closer look, and just as my fingers touched the counterweight, the stainless steel spider turned towards me, its metallic legs and body infused with life. It stretched downward towards my hand and the counterweight. It was restrained by the silvery strand holding it to the top of the wind chime frame. A loud voice boomed from inside the jewelry shop from behind the door

“Who comes, WHO COMES?” It rumbled, hissing with the same half-coughing and choking sound I had heard when I arrived at the shop for the very first time. I released the wind chime, shaken from my delusion and looked back at the spider. It was sitting as it always had been, just a lifeless chunk of polished stainless steel, drifting back and forth between its captive copper butterflies. It had only been a matter of seconds, but I was breathing as though I had just sprinted a couple hundred yards.

Still a bit startled, I replied loudly “Sorry Dan, it’s me, I..uhh..I..forgot ..something. Can I come in and grab it right quick?” I lied. I’d feel like a complete ass if Dan found me loitering on his front porch having hallucinations about his wind chimes. A few seconds of silence followed with no response, and I began to reach for the door knob to go back into the shop. I heard the crack of a beer can opening and then Dan’s voice called through the open door, but with a strange echo, as though he were far away.

“Come in, come in already!” the voice hissed. Ah crap I pissed Dan off, I hadn’t meant to. I went back in to the shop and walked to the small desk where I did much of my work. Looking around, I didn’t see Dan anywhere.

“You here Dan?” I asked, my voice somewhat raised and trembling. No response. I walked to my work desk and feigned looking for my apartment keys. I proclaimed loudly “Eureka! Got my keys. Ok Dan, see you tomorrow.” I was met with silence, and the feeling of sudden cold.

The shop had taken a sharp chill, even though the forge was going. I don’t know if it was temperature, or just my nerves of having been startled so badly from my spider hallucination. Either way, this was the first time I was leaving Dan’s place and I was glad to be doing so. As I turned, something on his workbench caught my eye. My jewelry piece. The one I had been practicing for weeks to try and craft. It was the only thing on his bench and it wasn’t a round ring anymore, it was a perfect butterfly, just the like ones outside on the windchimes. I heard a voice from behind me.

“It’s fine work isn’t it? Best I’ve seen in a long time. I’d say you earned this one, let’s have a drink.” I was startled to see Dan standing behind me, and I was afraid of my Master and friend.

“It’s late, I really should go, you were right. I’ll come back tomorr..”

“Nonsense! You did great work, look at all the pretties you have made. One drink from master to apprentice, and you can go home.”

For the first time he offered me one of his precious beers and I accepted. He quickly opened a fresh one of his own. Raising it in a “let’s toast” gesture. I reluctantly accepted. After all a quick sip and I could get out of here. Back home to my little matchbox apartment and cozy room heaters. Back to school. I raised my drink and took a long draught. It was the most skunky, foul, awful old and stale tasting brew I’d ever had. It was so bad I started to get dizzy. I like beer, I know beer, and this was not beer. I began to feel sick, and moved toward the door.

“I’m going to step out real fast. For some fresh air”. Dan was mid-chug of his third beer and motioned to the door with his elbow and a vocal grunt of “Mhrm Hrmm.”

I opened the back door of the shop, and braced myself in the doorway before the porch. I felt as though I had been hit in the head with a baseball bat and had a few stomps to the guts for good measure! The sound of the wind chimes filled my ears. I looked up and though there was not a breeze in the air, they were clanging around as though they were caught in a gale. “What the…” I slurred as I looked up, my eyes met the stainless steel spider striker, again filled with life, and scrambling downward to my head.

The counterweight fell off the chimes, and the spider followed. It landed right on my shoulder and I swatted it away and lost my balance, stumbling backwards through the door and falling onto the floor. The spider skittered past me and went into the shop, towards the jewelry cases and Dan’s workbench. The door latched closed with an ominous “THU-CLACK”. Amazed and horrified, I watched the spider skitter to Dan’s boot, up his leg and torso, toward his face. “DAN!, You seein’… the….” My words trailed off as I looked from the spider to Dan. He was sitting in his chair, but his face was ashy and sunken in. His clothes hung on his flesh and his eyes were deeply sunken into his face.

His visage was a mixture of purple, ashy white, green and a thick clear liquid oozed from his pores. The foul smell of rotting flesh filled the room. The spider ran up his neck, onto his face and crawled into his mouth, disappearing. Dan did not react, and paralyzed in trepidation, neither did I, other than a gaping jaw and a sick stomach. Without warning, this Dan’s rotting head turned, looked at me, and hissed;

“Back so soon? Why go out there when all the fun is here? We’re thirsty, and hungry, and you are ready and, well-marbled.…” … Dan’s laugh changed, becoming more throaty, guttural, and choking. The flames of the forge roared to full blast, and simultaneously the room became freezing cold. In a panic, and , hallucinating or not, all I could think of was the door and getting out of here.

“Fuck this! You go to hell!” I shrieked in fear and rage, my attempted intimidation marred by slurred speech. This image of Dan howled with laughter and hissed like that was the funniest joke he had ever heard.

“Go to hell? Dear boy, sometimes Hell …comes..to…you. See?” Dan said, the whites of his eyes glazing jet-black, his voice changing to the half-choking and throaty growl. I recognized it from my first arrival here at the shop, and fear took final hold of me. Thinking of my family and my friends and all the life I knew outside this place, I mustered all my strength and took a step back towards the door, and froze in my tracks. I saw…it.

Behind Dan, a figure appeared. Dark, shadowy and lank, resembling a man, but thin and sick as cancer grips a new corpse Black globs of putrid slimy substance fell from its body onto the floor, spreading into disgusting puddles.

It stood nearly eight feet high, and was a shade of black for which there is no name. Not shadow, not midnight, but the kind of darkness that pierces your heart with fear we don’t have a name for. It was, true evil. Tendril-like wires protruded from it into the foul corpse-like image of Dan. They pulled back and forth like tendons, bringing movement to the walking corpse that I had considered a friend not five minutes ago. Some of the putrid dark fluid flowed into Dan and it held an absolute control over Dan, like a puppet master and his marionette. It looked up from Dan, and fixed its gaze upon me. A feeling of loathing, hatred and malice fell over me. Yet there was something else I felt coming from this creature. Through the paralyzing fear, I recognized it. Anticipation.

Dan’s jaw moved, but the sound in the room came from this living dark creature. “All the pretty things…I KEEP!, and all the living things I REAP!!” it proclaimed with a piercing screech. Dan stood and both he and the creature began to move towards me with the deliberate steps of a hunter closing in on a cornered prey.
I felt my vision narrowing, blackness coming in. With what fleeting strength I had left in me, I fumbled for the door, and managed to open the latch, despite my fingers being stiff from the biting cold in the room. I knew I was done, but the world would see this thing take me. Someone would see, and talk.

I opened the door, and looked over my shoulder as I took a step out. The black outline of the creature filled my vision, and those soulless eyes closing in. Despite looking frail and sickly, the creature leapt at me with blinding speed. I felt claws grip me and fangs of ice pierce my neck, and I fell to the ground. Darkness took me. The metallic “clank” of metal on wood was the only sound in the room as I fell to the floor. I could see the entire room, but I could not move. I felt as though I were someplace else, watching a blurry tv screen with cheesecloth over my eyes.

Pain in every reach of my body seared through me and I was lifted in the air by the black tendons of the creature. My skin was torn from my back and stretched out tight onto a wire frame that hung above me. It was sealed to it with white-hot fire. My bones crunched as they were cracked like twigs and joined to the frame. I could see Dan in the room, and the dark creature behind him, his puppet master. My shrieks of fear were so loud it felt as though my eardrums would explode from the decibels. Dan made the gentle motions of a symphony conductor and smiled broadly,

“Such pretty screams from such a pretty thing. We can’t keep it to ourselves!” I was not sure if it was Dan or his Shadowy master who spoke, the pain was so terrible. I dropped to the ground and lay there in burning and freezing flayed agony. Dan bent down over me, and rifling through my clothes on the floor, he picked up a bright and shiny new copper butterfly. With all the excitement of a child receiving a long desired present, he threaded a fine silvery string through it, through me, from spine and stomach and sternum, and stepped outside. When he came back in, he had the set of wind chimes with him. The spider striker was missing. Dan attached the other end of the silver thread to his set of wind chimes. He lifted them until the string was taut under the weight of his perfect copper butterfly, and plucked it a few times with glee.

His blackened eyes rolled into the back of his head, his mouth opened wide, and the spider came crawling out. Down his arm and onto the brass butterfly it moved without fear or alarm. I tried to defend myself, but there was nothing I could do. I felt its legs glide over me, and the fangs sink into my body. The bite burned as though hot coals were being forced into me through the fang marks. The spider then took it’s position as the striker of the wind chimes, and though all signs of life fell from it, I still could feel it watching me, wanting to bite me again and again. Dan took the chimes, and hung them proudly over the entrance to his shop.

“There, now everyone can enjoy the pretty things, yes”. Dan gleefully remarked. It was here I realized my fate. This was no nightmare or illusion. I was not paralyzed on the floor, I was not drunk with fear and freezing to death in the grip of some kind of hallucinogenic seizure. I was trapped. Trapped here in my copper prison, to hang here in torment for God knows how long, subject only to the freezing cold hatred of the dark creature, the searing hot bite of the spider, and the drunken dizziness brought on by Dan’s vile brew. Dan sensed and delighted in my drunken struggle. He held up his hand to me, the counterweight in his hand. It bore the same markings I had crafted onto my project. My wings, myself, my very soul, “the pretties.” He set down his drink, and though I still writhed in agony, I felt my head clear a little. I looked at him as he spoke.

“You never learned the language of the pretties. What the marks mean.” Dan said. Running his finger over his intricate script design. His eyes were black and soulless, oozing hate and malice towards me. His gaze fell to the inscription. “All the pretty things I keep…yes, you know this part now. Now and forever. But also know this.” He continued, half speaking, half chanting his words. The whole shop shook violently as he spoke, two voices as one. The evil one and his puppet together; The words were not any language I had heard before, yet I understood them.

“All the preety things I reap, Flames and freezing, Venom’s Hate; these I craft and these make. Souls I take, forever bound, Never freed, and never found. Only sorrow for you my sweet, for all the pretty things I keep.”

The shaking stopped, leaving only the wind chimes and the overheat light swaying a bit. Dan continued;

“That is what the pretties mean. That is all they mean. They are the remnants of the language of the ancient dark ones, of the first shadow. The language that breeds darkness and festers hate. There are other pretties for greed, for lust and shame and all the prime corruptions, but this is my favorite, it is my craft.” Dan looked over his shoulder almost lovingly at his master, before looking to me again, hissing his contempt and loathing towards me.

“I taught you how to make the pretties, you never asked what they meant. You mastered every stroke and loved it. You accepted it. Now you wear your ignorance and rot with your prize! Once the pretties take hold of you, they never let you go, and neither will we“ Dan said, cracking open a beer. He took a long pull, and I again felt the spider’s bite, reeling into a poisoned state of mind.

The searing fire of the spider’s venom flowed through every capillary, burning inside as though I had injected the very fires of the forge itself into my veins. On the outside, I froze, so cold I felt as though I were shivering violently. I pulled and twisted, gnashing my teeth against the horrid cold, screaming each time I tried to move. I could feel my skin stick to the freezing metal, each time I lashed out, bits of skin tearing from my hand with each strike. Frost formed at my lips and on my eyelashes.

Though I knew time was passing because the sun would rise and set, I could not track i. I hung here in my wind chime gallows. Watching the half-corpse of Dan and his dark puppet master sell jewelry to customers was terrible, every piece inscribed with the curse verse. They could not see what I could. They laughed and joked with the ever-charming Dan and his cordial charms.

Every customer who came to the store marveled at the intricate butterfly wind chimes, admiring the handiwork and complimenting Dan on his masterpiece. I shrieked warnings to them so loudly I occasionally felt a vocal chord snap, sending blood spewing from my throat, which would freeze onto my prison walls and floor. I pounded and scratched until the bones of my hands were exposed and my fingernails were snapped off, all in an effort to warn the people away from this evil place.

With every sale, I recalled Dan’s words about how every piece he made left his mark upon people, and I wept for them. There is no good thing that could come from anyone taking such darkness and either wearing it themselves, or worse, giving it to a loved one as a gift. Yet Dan still plied his hate craft and made his Eternal Keepsakes for people to enjoy in blissful ignorance. The only warning the outside world could ever perceive was the gentle and soothing metallic wailing of the butterfly chimes when there was no breeze. But even then, nobody noticed, nobody cared, and nobody ever, ever knew.

57e1lh,5,2016-10-13,All the Pretty Things,bigfatbino,libraryofshadows,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/57e1lh/all_the_pretty_things/,"The first of the sounds was really quite faint. I heard it coming through the cracked open window in my classroom. The subsequent tones escaped me, since immediately at the sound of the tolling belltower the classroom erupted into activity and cheers. Classroom doors flew open, followed by organized chaos throughout the campus as locker doors opened and slammed shut. Elevators creaked and squealed, stopping at every floor going up or down, bearing students and faculty alike from warm classrooms to the brisk chill of a fast-approaching winter.

Today was especially busy; the air itself seemed charged with anticipation as the crowds departed campus. This was the last day of school before the winter break began. Many would be traveling home to see family and friends with the hope of being able to stuff themselves so full of turkey and other goodies that the stress of essay writing and final exams would melt away into sweet oblivion. On my way to the elevator, I noticed a nice new bulletin was posted on the community announcements board. I always made it a point to keep up on the new postings to the community board, mostly just because I wanted to read something other than a textbook. It also afforded me the opportunity to steal stray thumbtacks for later rubberband-launching. I won’t tell campus security if you don’t…. This particular posting was headlined:

“Winter Break Community Intern/Apprenticeship Opportunities; learn something fun and new!”

Listings for “intern”, “apprentice” and “entry-level” positions offered by attorney offices, plumbers, even radio and TV internships filled the page, all offering exposition in a respective craft, presumably designed to help coax new talent into a field. Many of the internships were unpaid, offering “valuable experience” as their reward. Several of the “opportunities” charged a fee for providing tools or other materials. I chuckled at the page, marveling at how there always seemed to be a hundred ways for money to depart a wallet, but very few ways for it to get in there. I began to turn away from the board and rejoin the bustling flock of migrating students, when something caught my eye near the bottom of the page

“Eternal Keepsakes” Jewelers Apprentice: mini-internship with master-craftsman. Experience classic techniques and make your own!

I had always been interested in making jewelry. My family came from a long line of model-makers, sculptors, and artists of some sort or another, and I had always liked the thought of making my own jewelry pieces. I pulled the last tab that had the contact information on it, and put it in my wallet. This was worth serious consideration.

A few days and a hangover or two later, the revelry of the Christmas season was well under way, evidenced by the endless onslaught of “Happy Holidays” and “Sale, Sale Sale!” signs in every shop window. And I was already bored and tired of it all. I suppose it was chance that when “Silver bells” came on for what seemed the millionth damned time, I was going down the list of things that they could have sung about other than damned bells, muttering to myself in tones of rapt boredom and early holiday exhaustion;

“Silver Bells, Silver spoons, Silver spurs, Silver …jewelry.” I stopped and remembered the piece of paper neatly tucked into my wallet. I pulled it out and looked at it while my mind pondered the possibilities. I could just hang out and enjoy myself for the next three weeks and not really worry about having to do anything or be anywhere. But on the flip side of that coin, pissing a break away on booze, boredom, and pizza box collecting was not the best way to spend it. Might as well do something new! II picked up the phone and dialed the number in the ad. It rang once on the other end of the line:

“Eternal Keepsakes, Dan speaking. Hello Brian calling about the internship?” a man’s voice answered the phone, and caught me a bit off guard. I hadn’t expected the phone to be answered so quickly, or have a total stranger know my name and why I was calling. I paused awkwardly, and let out a perplexed and weirded out “uhhhh.”

I heard a chuckle, followed by “Caller ID says Brian Cooper. And my phone hasn’t rand so much in the past 30 years as it has in the last few days since I put those flyers out. Most ask about the internship right before they start fishing for discounts on presents. So is it discounts or the internship you’re after?” Guy was to the point and sharp as a razor, but had a good-natured tone to him, the kind that your friends would heckle you with before getting the next round of drinks.

“Hi, yeah this is Brian, and yes I’m interested in the internship.”

“Ok, well then here’s the deal. I’ve said no to everyone so far since I felt they were fishing for cheap jewelry. So if I take you I need you to not go blabbing that you got the gig, that’ll make my life complicated if things get around. Also this is an everyday activity, you have to be here 7 days a week, even if it’s only for an hour. Just like practicing a musical instrument. At the end you’ll have your own piece that you can keep forever or vice versa! Sound good?” We talked a bit more, and he put me at ease with his light hearted and slightly irreverent banter, assuring me that he had every certification in the craft, including experience that went back since “Before Noah was a zoo-keeping sailor in that little cruise ship!”

I grabbed a pen and scrawled the directions he gave me onto my hand. “2409 East Walnut St., entrance around back, got it. See you tomorrow Dan.” I said, repeating Dan’s directions. His shop was just about four miles from me, if my phone maps app was worth a shit. Tomorrow would be a good day, IF I got my ass in gear and got the laundry done. I hadn’t done laundry or dishes in nearly a week. I had taken a liking to the small neighborhoods of the Northern district in the city of Roses, the nickname stemming from the wild rose bushes that grew all over the place. Many of the streets were lined with old trees, and most of the houses were built well before the “cookie cutter” developments of today.

English Tudors with front-yard rose gardens shared borders and fences with southwest mission style homes, complete with cast iron bells and tall eucalyptus trees. I often meandered around for hours admiring the side streets. Yards were kept up, any dogs I saw were leashed, walking with their owners down the sidewalks, “scoopers” in hand to cleanup any messes, and friendly waves were freely given. How inviting it all was. Luckily for me, my admittedly rather long walk from my place to Dan’s took me all the way through the nice neighborhoods. I had not yet ventured this far north before, so it was nice to strike out early and cover some new ground.

When I turned onto Walnut St, I was in the 1600 block, probably just a mile or two from my destination. I counted the blocks passing as I got closer to my destination. By the time I reached the 2000’s, the charming neighborhoods had long faded into the distance, and the horizon presented only a few run-down houses here and there. Warehouses and empty lots dotted the sides of the road, and the faint bouquet of diesel trucks and garbage quickly replaced the smell of eucalyptus and roses.

I passed a large wrought iron gate and a huge dog appeared from under a low wooden deck and lunged at me. As he hit the gate, the metal creaked and squealed, the force of it sending hot drool from his jaws onto my forearm, the cold air making his breath seem more suited to a dragon than a canine.

“SHIT!” I half-shrieked, jumping back from the gate and pausing to read the engraved sign on it:

“Beware of Dog, no soliciting, proceed at your own risk!”

“No shit.” I answered the sign, and took a much quicker gait to the end of the house, only then halting to stoop down and wipe dog drool off my arm while I could still get a look at the mut. My composure slowly returned. “Sonuvabitch! Damned Mutt! …Just my damned luck, his jeweler’s shop had to be in the fertilizer district of the city of Roses.” I muttered aloud, half to myself, and the rest of it directed at the dog and his neighborhood.

A few more blocks passed, and I found my destination on the right. An old brick building with a large glass window had faded gold-colored lettering “2409 E. Walnut St.” below the address the name “Eternal Keepsakes; fine crafts.” The roof of the place was a nice shake-shingle material, and though the bricks showed considerable age, it looked as though the place had been kept up as well as could be expected. The place must have been at least 90 years old I guessed, simply because nobody built anything out of pure brick, stone, and mortar like this anymore, except perhaps for mausoleums and monuments. A thin wisp of smoke crept from a chimney around the back of the small building.

I walked down the slim driveway to the left of the small storefront to the back as instructed and opened the small wooden gate with the “entrance” sign on it. The only gate situated between the brick walls that bordered the property. No sooner had the gate clacked shut, and I heard a voice emanate from an open, curtain less window near the back porch door. I saw a brief slender shadow move through the window.

“Who comes?” The voice called loudly , sounding a life-long smoker who was caught half choking, as though a gulp of water had gone down the wrong pipe in a mis-swallow.

“It’s Me, Brian, am I too early?” I called back, shouting at the building, maybe a little too loud, but at least Dan would hear me through the brick walls. “Nah, You’re just in time. Come on in, door’s open.” I then recognized Dan’s voice right away. At least I wouldn’t walk in to find him half-dead and choking on the floor, talk about a bad way to start an apprenticeship.

I walked up the few stone steps to a brick archway and door with a single dull-yellow bulb for an entry light. The door to the back of the shop itself was impressive. It was made of solid oak planks, with cast iron binding and hinges. Just above the doorway, there hung a set of intricate handmade wind chimes. Several forged copper butterflies hung suspended from silverish thread or wiring, spinning slowly and gently on their wires. Some were very green with age; others were a bit newer looking, with just a hint of greenish-copper patina. The striker was a large spider, from some kind of alloy that gave it a mirror shine and also made it impervious to any sign of wear from the elements, below it hung a large counterweight with intricate but shallow inscriptions I could not make out.

I reached for the door and pressed the thumb latch down and it swung open, without so much as a creak from the hinges. As I closed the door, I heard the wind chimes sound faintly, a butterfly or two clanging against the cast-metal spider. I didn’t feel any kind of breeze on the back of my neck. It must have been the vibration from me opening the door. I stepped into the shop and the door closed behind me with a loud “Thu-Clank.”

“Hey Brian, great to see you! I’m Dan, short for Daniel Mammon.” A short and stubby man, who I could best describe as the lost Hippie Love child of Willie Nelson and Santa Claus appeared from behind a large blacksmith’s forge in the middle of the room. He was mostly bald, save for a small ring of thin white hair around the back of his head, falling into a short and wiry gray beard. He wore a thick leather apron on top of a blue shirt, black jeans, and black leather boots which showed so much wear, it would not have surprised me one bit if they had been made before beer led to bar fights. He wore earrings, about 5 of them in each ear, had at least a half-dozen different necklaces with gems, and charms on them. On the middle finger of each hand he wore a ring, silver on the right, gold on the left, with quite intricate carvings on each. He walked over to a small jewelry counter on the right side of the shop, clutching a beer bottle in one hand and some business looking papers and pen in the other.

“Let’s get the red-tape Bullshit out of the way first, whaddaya say?” he placed the papers and pen on a glass countertop of a jewelry case and made a “come hither” motion, beer still in hand. As I walked over, he took a loonnnggg pull from the bottle, drinking at least half of the beer in a few seconds. He followed this with a wall-shaking belch and laughed. I liked this guy already.

“Sounds good to me, sir.” I said, a smile coming to my face. I grabbed the pen and started reading through the papers fine print and all.

“Bah! Don’t call me ‘Sir’, makes me think my ol’man is gonna walk through the door!” Dan joked, and finished chugging his beer. He reached under the counter and opened a small mini-fridge, and grabbed another beer, cracking it open and taking a good solid pull. His breathe reeked of alcohol, and I knew he was probably impaired to no end. Hell I almost got drunk from the vapors he exhaled.

“Dammit Bud, we’ll be here all night. Lemme summarize that crap for you. I agree to demonstrate, you agree to learn, and if you get hurt, it ain’t my fault, so don’t sue me. Now c’mon, sign your life away and let’s get going!” Dan said, somewhat joking yet impatient, as though he would have rather been at the dentist for a root canal than deal with paperwork. “Hell, sounds ok to me.” I laughed and smiled, eager to get on Dan’s good side. I scanned through the paperwork quickly. I scrawled my finest “apprentice-worthy” signature onto the parchment and he turned to me and with an almost gleeful look on his face he said;

“Right on! Ok Bud, Let’s get your tools and get started.”

“Ok so we know not to go blabbing, and we know to be here everyday. Beyond that, the only rules are don’t touch the billows and fire or any other equipment, or my beer. I don’t want you burning my place down, and I especially don’t want you doing it if you’re more buzzed than me!” Dan slapped me on the shoulder and finished his admonishment with a throaty laugh and beer breath that would choke an alcoholic. He handed me a small canvas container.

“Here’s your tools. You do a good job, and you can have those too.”

“Thanks! I’ll give it my all!” I replied, smiling, and now secretly wondering if there was also a rule about me bringing my own beer, but I decided to keep that question to myself.

The shop itself wasn’t really much at all. There was the back of the shop where Dan kept much of his equipment, a few small jewelry shelves on the driveway side of the shop to the right of the backdoor as I stood in it, a bathroom to the left which was in a state of questionable sanitation. The main jewelry display case for customers was in the front of the store facing Walnut St.

The highlight of the shop was the forge and billows, The large stone forge seemed as though it were made from a single large boulder, hollowed out with an impressive stone façade surrounding it, serving as both a hearth and workbench for Dan, and as a fire-stop in case something came out of the furnace a little too hot to handle and needed to be quickly dropped. A large stone chimney extended upward through the roof. The whole building seemed to have been built around the forge itself. I could see how this shop had at some point possibly been a blacksmith’s hutch many years past. A small workbench sat in the back of the shop, which became my workstation. I could see just enough of the front entrance get a good view of the door and could alert Dan about any customers entering from the back, though I had never seen anyone there but Dan and myself.

The next two weeks flew by. I learned just about everything there was to know about wax, clay, alloys, casting, polishing, hammering, and shining jewelry pieces. The main thing I learned was ring-making, stamping intricate sheet, and soldering. “With these skills, you can make 99% of what’s out there.” Dan would say. All my work had to be perfect before I could move to the next “level.” “Heating the fires a degree” he called it. By the time I had ring-making down, I barely noticed the old burns I had sustained in the process. Even the new burns didn’t bother me much, it was just part of the gig. By the end, stamping any sheet into any shape and soldering them all together was easy. I even showed off to Dan by soldering two pieces of aluminum foil gum wrapper together. For a split second, my Master looked impressed. But only for a split second and in a breath it was back to work.

I started spending more and more time in the shop Admittedly, I did this partly because I was really enjoying what Dan had to teach, and also because it was nice and warm in the shop, thanks to Dan’s ever-burning furnace. No matter how many feeble space heaters I put in my apartment, there was no matching the radiant heat of the forge.

By the time my third week had started, Dan had begun teaching me how to scribe artful scripts into ring blanks, leaving enough room for a name to be engraved on a finished cast. It was a form of precision wax engraving I truly admired. He called his script “pretties.” because the term “bling” was too “god-damned millennial generation”, or so he claimed. Personally I didn’t think a jeweler had any business dismissing anything for being “too materialistic”, but that was just me. All of his work had these intricate designs of loops, swirls, lines and curves carved into the wax patterns. The markings themselves were finer than the finest of any calligraphers pen stroke, it was a marvel to behold such skill. With the exception of the times when he was showing me a technique or giving me good natured but thorough criticism of my work, Dan was always working, most of the time on adding to his beautifully engraved butterfly wind chimes, which he called “his prettiest of pretties.”

Despite his perpetual beer-in-hand status, Dan moved with absolute mastery of his instruments. Any time I came by, the furnace was blazing; he had the billows and the forge working. Dan was always busy working on a piece, and I never once saw him make any kind of mistake. I kept practicing and practicing, and finally I handed Dan my latest ring that I had scripted with Dan’s Hippie “pretties” pattern and he inspected it. He raised an eyebrow and looked at me, “Now by the fires I think you’ve got it. This is good work here!” he gleefully slurred. I think you’re just about ready! He turned around and put it onto his workbench, all the while mumbling to himself. I caught the words “pretties” or “keepsake”. He glanced at the clock and back at me and raised his eyebrows.

“Wow its late Bud, I lost track of time. Finish up and head-on out.” I thought this was a little odd, since I had now been coming to the shop everyday for nearly twelve hours a day. After cleaning up my bench from it’s daily collection of wax-shavings, and dust, I grabbed my coat and headed for the door.

“See you tomorrow Dan,” I said over my shoulder, stepping out from the warm shop into the chilly stillness of the evening air. Behind my back I heard him say

“Tomorrow if not sooner bud!”. The door clicked behind me and I started the walk home.

As I was passing under the archway, I heard the faint jingle of the windchimes. This time it seemed odd to me, as I had not slammed the door on my way out, nor was I stomping my feet around. There was not even the faintest hint of a breeze in the air. I turned to look, remembering I had wanted to have a closer look at Dan’s craftsmanship of this marvelous piece. On the counterweight below the spider, I looked closely at an inscription etched upon the band. The inscription was surrounded by Dan’s trademark “pretties” design and the text itself was almost imperceptible from the script, but I made it out. It read; “All the pretty things I keep”. I reached to have a closer look, and just as my fingers touched the counterweight, the stainless steel spider turned towards me, its metallic legs and body infused with life. It stretched downward towards my hand and the counterweight. It was restrained by the silvery strand holding it to the top of the wind chime frame. A loud voice boomed from inside the jewelry shop from behind the door

“Who comes, WHO COMES?” It rumbled, hissing with the same half-coughing and choking sound I had heard when I arrived at the shop for the very first time. I released the wind chime, shaken from my delusion and looked back at the spider. It was sitting as it always had been, just a lifeless chunk of polished stainless steel, drifting back and forth between its captive copper butterflies. It had only been a matter of seconds, but I was breathing as though I had just sprinted a couple hundred yards.

Still a bit startled, I replied loudly “Sorry Dan, it’s me, I..uhh..I..forgot ..something. Can I come in and grab it right quick?” I lied. I’d feel like a complete ass if Dan found me loitering on his front porch having hallucinations about his wind chimes. A few seconds of silence followed with no response, and I began to reach for the door knob to go back into the shop. I heard the crack of a beer can opening and then Dan’s voice called through the open door, but with a strange echo, as though he were far away.

“Come in, come in already!” the voice hissed. Ah crap I pissed Dan off, I hadn’t meant to. I went back in to the shop and walked to the small desk where I did much of my work. Looking around, I didn’t see Dan anywhere.

“You here Dan?” I asked, my voice somewhat raised and trembling. No response. I walked to my work desk and feigned looking for my apartment keys. I proclaimed loudly “Eureka! Got my keys. Ok Dan, see you tomorrow.” I was met with silence, and the feeling of sudden cold.

The shop had taken a sharp chill, even though the forge was going. I don’t know if it was temperature, or just my nerves of having been startled so badly from my spider hallucination. Either way, this was the first time I was leaving Dan’s place and I was glad to be doing so. As I turned, something on his workbench caught my eye. My jewelry piece. The one I had been practicing for weeks to try and craft. It was the only thing on his bench and it wasn’t a round ring anymore, it was a perfect butterfly, just the like ones outside on the windchimes. I heard a voice from behind me.

“It’s fine work isn’t it? Best I’ve seen in a long time. I’d say you earned this one, let’s have a drink.” I was startled to see Dan standing behind me, and I was afraid of my Master and friend.

“It’s late, I really should go, you were right. I’ll come back tomorr..”

“Nonsense! You did great work, look at all the pretties you have made. One drink from master to apprentice, and you can go home.”

For the first time he offered me one of his precious beers and I accepted. He quickly opened a fresh one of his own. Raising it in a “let’s toast” gesture. I reluctantly accepted. After all a quick sip and I could get out of here. Back home to my little matchbox apartment and cozy room heaters. Back to school. I raised my drink and took a long draught. It was the most skunky, foul, awful old and stale tasting brew I’d ever had. It was so bad I started to get dizzy. I like beer, I know beer, and this was not beer. I began to feel sick, and moved toward the door.

“I’m going to step out real fast. For some fresh air”. Dan was mid-chug of his third beer and motioned to the door with his elbow and a vocal grunt of “Mhrm Hrmm.”

I opened the back door of the shop, and braced myself in the doorway before the porch. I felt as though I had been hit in the head with a baseball bat and had a few stomps to the guts for good measure! The sound of the wind chimes filled my ears. I looked up and though there was not a breeze in the air, they were clanging around as though they were caught in a gale. “What the…” I slurred as I looked up, my eyes met the stainless steel spider striker, again filled with life, and scrambling downward to my head.

The counterweight fell off the chimes, and the spider followed. It landed right on my shoulder and I swatted it away and lost my balance, stumbling backwards through the door and falling onto the floor. The spider skittered past me and went into the shop, towards the jewelry cases and Dan’s workbench. The door latched closed with an ominous “THU-CLACK”. Amazed and horrified, I watched the spider skitter to Dan’s boot, up his leg and torso, toward his face. “DAN!, You seein’… the….” My words trailed off as I looked from the spider to Dan. He was sitting in his chair, but his face was ashy and sunken in. His clothes hung on his flesh and his eyes were deeply sunken into his face.

His visage was a mixture of purple, ashy white, green and a thick clear liquid oozed from his pores. The foul smell of rotting flesh filled the room. The spider ran up his neck, onto his face and crawled into his mouth, disappearing. Dan did not react, and paralyzed in trepidation, neither did I, other than a gaping jaw and a sick stomach. Without warning, this Dan’s rotting head turned, looked at me, and hissed;

“Back so soon? Why go out there when all the fun is here? We’re thirsty, and hungry, and you are ready and, well-marbled.…” … Dan’s laugh changed, becoming more throaty, guttural, and choking. The flames of the forge roared to full blast, and simultaneously the room became freezing cold. In a panic, and , hallucinating or not, all I could think of was the door and getting out of here.

“Fuck this! You go to hell!” I shrieked in fear and rage, my attempted intimidation marred by slurred speech. This image of Dan howled with laughter and hissed like that was the funniest joke he had ever heard.

“Go to hell? Dear boy, sometimes Hell …comes..to…you. See?” Dan said, the whites of his eyes glazing jet-black, his voice changing to the half-choking and throaty growl. I recognized it from my first arrival here at the shop, and fear took final hold of me. Thinking of my family and my friends and all the life I knew outside this place, I mustered all my strength and took a step back towards the door, and froze in my tracks. I saw…it.

Behind Dan, a figure appeared. Dark, shadowy and lank, resembling a man, but thin and sick as cancer grips a new corpse Black globs of putrid slimy substance fell from its body onto the floor, spreading into disgusting puddles.

It stood nearly eight feet high, and was a shade of black for which there is no name. Not shadow, not midnight, but the kind of darkness that pierces your heart with fear we don’t have a name for. It was, true evil. Tendril-like wires protruded from it into the foul corpse-like image of Dan. They pulled back and forth like tendons, bringing movement to the walking corpse that I had considered a friend not five minutes ago. Some of the putrid dark fluid flowed into Dan and it held an absolute control over Dan, like a puppet master and his marionette. It looked up from Dan, and fixed its gaze upon me. A feeling of loathing, hatred and malice fell over me. Yet there was something else I felt coming from this creature. Through the paralyzing fear, I recognized it. Anticipation.

Dan’s jaw moved, but the sound in the room came from this living dark creature. “All the pretty things…I KEEP!, and all the living things I REAP!!” it proclaimed with a piercing screech. Dan stood and both he and the creature began to move towards me with the deliberate steps of a hunter closing in on a cornered prey.
I felt my vision narrowing, blackness coming in. With what fleeting strength I had left in me, I fumbled for the door, and managed to open the latch, despite my fingers being stiff from the biting cold in the room. I knew I was done, but the world would see this thing take me. Someone would see, and talk.

I opened the door, and looked over my shoulder as I took a step out. The black outline of the creature filled my vision, and those soulless eyes closing in. Despite looking frail and sickly, the creature leapt at me with blinding speed. I felt claws grip me and fangs of ice pierce my neck, and I fell to the ground. Darkness took me. The metallic “clank” of metal on wood was the only sound in the room as I fell to the floor. I could see the entire room, but I could not move. I felt as though I were someplace else, watching a blurry tv screen with cheesecloth over my eyes.

Pain in every reach of my body seared through me and I was lifted in the air by the black tendons of the creature. My skin was torn from my back and stretched out tight onto a wire frame that hung above me. It was sealed to it with white-hot fire. My bones crunched as they were cracked like twigs and joined to the frame. I could see Dan in the room, and the dark creature behind him, his puppet master. My shrieks of fear were so loud it felt as though my eardrums would explode from the decibels. Dan made the gentle motions of a symphony conductor and smiled broadly,

“Such pretty screams from such a pretty thing. We can’t keep it to ourselves!” I was not sure if it was Dan or his Shadowy master who spoke, the pain was so terrible. I dropped to the ground and lay there in burning and freezing flayed agony. Dan bent down over me, and rifling through my clothes on the floor, he picked up a bright and shiny new copper butterfly. With all the excitement of a child receiving a long desired present, he threaded a fine silvery string through it, through me, from spine and stomach and sternum, and stepped outside. When he came back in, he had the set of wind chimes with him. The spider striker was missing. Dan attached the other end of the silver thread to his set of wind chimes. He lifted them until the string was taut under the weight of his perfect copper butterfly, and plucked it a few times with glee.

His blackened eyes rolled into the back of his head, his mouth opened wide, and the spider came crawling out. Down his arm and onto the brass butterfly it moved without fear or alarm. I tried to defend myself, but there was nothing I could do. I felt its legs glide over me, and the fangs sink into my body. The bite burned as though hot coals were being forced into me through the fang marks. The spider then took it’s position as the striker of the wind chimes, and though all signs of life fell from it, I still could feel it watching me, wanting to bite me again and again. Dan took the chimes, and hung them proudly over the entrance to his shop.

“There, now everyone can enjoy the pretty things, yes”. Dan gleefully remarked. It was here I realized my fate. This was no nightmare or illusion. I was not paralyzed on the floor, I was not drunk with fear and freezing to death in the grip of some kind of hallucinogenic seizure. I was trapped. Trapped here in my copper prison, to hang here in torment for God knows how long, subject only to the freezing cold hatred of the dark creature, the searing hot bite of the spider, and the drunken dizziness brought on by Dan’s vile brew. Dan sensed and delighted in my drunken struggle. He held up his hand to me, the counterweight in his hand. It bore the same markings I had crafted onto my project. My wings, myself, my very soul, “the pretties.” He set down his drink, and though I still writhed in agony, I felt my head clear a little. I looked at him as he spoke.

“You never learned the language of the pretties. What the marks mean.” Dan said. Running his finger over his intricate script design. His eyes were black and soulless, oozing hate and malice towards me. His gaze fell to the inscription. “All the pretty things I keep…yes, you know this part now. Now and forever. But also know this.” He continued, half speaking, half chanting his words. The whole shop shook violently as he spoke, two voices as one. The evil one and his puppet together; The words were not any language I had heard before, yet I understood them.

“All the preety things I reap, Flames and freezing, Venom’s Hate; these I craft and these make. Souls I take, forever bound, Never freed, and never found. Only sorrow for you my sweet, for all the pretty things I keep.”

The shaking stopped, leaving only the wind chimes and the overheat light swaying a bit. Dan continued;

“That is what the pretties mean. That is all they mean. They are the remnants of the language of the ancient dark ones, of the first shadow. The language that breeds darkness and festers hate. There are other pretties for greed, for lust and shame and all the prime corruptions, but this is my favorite, it is my craft.” Dan looked over his shoulder almost lovingly at his master, before looking to me again, hissing his contempt and loathing towards me.

“I taught you how to make the pretties, you never asked what they meant. You mastered every stroke and loved it. You accepted it. Now you wear your ignorance and rot with your prize! Once the pretties take hold of you, they never let you go, and neither will we“ Dan said, cracking open a beer. He took a long pull, and I again felt the spider’s bite, reeling into a poisoned state of mind.

The searing fire of the spider’s venom flowed through every capillary, burning inside as though I had injected the very fires of the forge itself into my veins. On the outside, I froze, so cold I felt as though I were shivering violently. I pulled and twisted, gnashing my teeth against the horrid cold, screaming each time I tried to move. I could feel my skin stick to the freezing metal, each time I lashed out, bits of skin tearing from my hand with each strike. Frost formed at my lips and on my eyelashes.

Though I knew time was passing because the sun would rise and set, I could not track i. I hung here in my wind chime gallows. Watching the half-corpse of Dan and his dark puppet master sell jewelry to customers was terrible, every piece inscribed with the curse verse. They could not see what I could. They laughed and joked with the ever-charming Dan and his cordial charms.

Every customer who came to the store marveled at the intricate butterfly wind chimes, admiring the handiwork and complimenting Dan on his masterpiece. I shrieked warnings to them so loudly I occasionally felt a vocal chord snap, sending blood spewing from my throat, which would freeze onto my prison walls and floor. I pounded and scratched until the bones of my hands were exposed and my fingernails were snapped off, all in an effort to warn the people away from this evil place.

With every sale, I recalled Dan’s words about how every piece he made left his mark upon people, and I wept for them. There is no good thing that could come from anyone taking such darkness and either wearing it themselves, or worse, giving it to a loved one as a gift. Yet Dan still plied his hate craft and made his Eternal Keepsakes for people to enjoy in blissful ignorance. The only warning the outside world could ever perceive was the gentle and soothing metallic wailing of the butterfly chimes when there was no breeze. But even then, nobody noticed, nobody cared, and nobody ever, ever knew.

I tried the Adderall XR in the past but for some reason was better on the IR or at least more effective at asserting myself until it became horrible, so I decided to ask my doc for Adderall XR 25 mg and just held onto it after finals for my summer internship position, but also asked for the first time for an SSRI that treated anxiety called Lexapro. He put me on 10 mg and instantly i was able to go to class and sit in my chair without shaking or hiding my ass, I became so viciously angry at my family for letting me get so low that I now had even more motivation than before. I ended up on a combo of Lexapro 10 mg and Adderall XR 25 mg and went off to Washington with my girl  but didn't take adderall dose yet just lexapro. First day i noticed at work I wasn't normal or at least not in right frame of mind on lexapro, i was uncomfortable at whatever i was feeling or where it was coming from so i immediately opened my adderall and took it with lexapro, FINALLY stability. I was able to go to work and yea i felt sped up sometimes but finally was able to settle in and get in a routine with her of hitting gym every morning, but didn't listen to supervisors and felt somewhat manic. I knew something had to be off but didn't know what or why.

Fast forward some time, i went back to LS my third year and knew we wouldn't last if I stayed on Adderall so i tried to live better and jumped to Vyvanse 50 mg and Lexapro 10 mg. I looked even better, but she looked more uncomfortable around me and I did lose my motivation and drive to the point i couldn't answer a question in class. we spent my third year working out and BS i felt my resume was good enough and didn't realize how much i lost direction of my own life...

bar exam rolls around switch back to adderall, she disappears and i focus in on my exam and she dumps me day of my bar exam after i failed the first time. i knew her true colors were about money as i became worse again or started to see not sure yet, but regardless financially  i couldn't escape her house every weekend with her anymore and her step dad was putting her on me and i was trying the entire time to move out with her. I figured lexapro was a problem so i tried to come off it and immediately starting panicking and getting worse that i now was on on lexapro 10 mg and  klonopin  10  mg  for  additional panic and anxiety to help me sleep. i was in worst condition since july and been broke since. few weeks ago i started lexapro back up and started owning my decisions, felt more responsible for the mess i was in and didn't want to blame her anymore, the lexapro i thought ruined me  actually helped me.

i figured since just waiting on results take strict D-amp and vyvanse never worked for me as i was always irritable on it so my doc knew i was in bad way and gave me dex spansules 10 mg twice a day and i got my hands on some nuvigil . it was by far best i felt on add meds and i visited her at work and asked to speak to her in private. her staff immediately gave me dirty looks as they should have i guess, but i apologized and took responsibility for causing a mess in her life and mine and said i was growing she said she could see that and always knew i was living in a toxic broken home and she is doing better too now (i could easily see she was on something that she quit and didn't look like she even knew what happened unless i need adderall and don't realize it cause classes are over and she doesn't know how to tell me). she told me she slept with someone 20 days after our breakup when she dumped me day of my bar exam which caused me to get worse, but my motivation for getting better was to live better so i said i wasn't there to get back just to say sorry and she started sweating looking like she wanted to cry and said she's not with anyone really .. and i said whatever regardless you look great and she said ill see you as in she expected to see me soon enough.

so i had bachelor party with my friends i went too and noticed i wasn't having as much fun as i use to with my ex and felt limited mentally, i knew maybe the damp and nuvigil wasn't working as well, even after hooking up with new random girl over there. i still loved my ex and didn't know what happened... now here i am 2 to 3 weeks away from results and my doc is asking what meds i want to try now... my family is hesitant over here to see me go back to adderall, yet i worked in a very prestigious office in washington on it that second summer with my ex and they said any girl would have gone but whatever she was amazing and i obviously live better with her. 

i told my family ill call in my adderall if i need it cause need stability and a job but i will admit the l-amp does cause an anxiety i almost can't stand anymore and my ex also said adderall was an issue so didn't want it even if i needed it in a way... Ive heard of Evekeo and was thinking of calling in that with dex spangles and changing lexapro to effexor but i will say this.... Lexapro is impossible for me to get off of for whatever reason i go into horrible GI problems and panic attack mode, that i def need it. 

Just been on Lex and nuvigil but nuvigil causes insomnia. Should I ask for the time released adderall as its more subtle than adderall IR or never go back and try evoke or something else? the key here is to be subtle cause I'm interviewing at some places and can't look like 27 year old crackajack but also need to treat my mental issues. Either I have ADHD and my ex was tired of me on and off meds or I don't and its taking care of another condition that my family doesn't believe in it. Help please TY"
57eknh,13,2016-10-14,"Has Anyone Here Marched a Season, Then Decided Not To Do Anymore?",deadlybacon7,drumcorps,https://www.reddit.com/r/drumcorps/comments/57eknh/has_anyone_here_marched_a_season_then_decided_not/,"I spent this last summer with Cadets2 and had an absolute blast. I loved knowing my show inside and out, working 110% every rehearsal, and getting my ass kicked by staff whenever necessary. Marching drum corps was as great as I expected it to be, often better even.

Now that the season is way done and auditions are coming up for Cadets who I was hoping to make this year, I'm not sure if I want to continue marching. I feel like I've gotten the experience I wanted to get, and am now more excited to move on to new things other than drum corps. For example, I've been offerered an internship at a recording studio over the summer (my career goals are in audio engineering, etc.), I want to move into my own place and afford it, focus on writing and performing my OWN music rather than Corps music, and frankly I don't want to worry about the financial commitment that is drum corps. 

I have four years left to march. That's 12 months of my life spent at drum corps, and roughly $16k. I'm not sure if I want to commit that to drum corps anymore, like I used to.

Has anyone else experienced this, where you feel like your horizons are expanding etc. and you'd rather spend the time and energy on things other than drum corps? What did you decide to do, was it worth it? I'm definitely feeling a bit confused since I've spent the last five years of my life devoted to drum corps and now I feel more than ready to do other things after only one season of DCA.

Thanks"
57eux5,1,2016-10-14,Where are the recaps/highlights on the NHL app?,exposure-dose,hockey,https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/57eux5/where_are_the_recapshighlights_on_the_nhl_app/,"It's now almost 1:30 on the East Coast and we have exactly 1 viewable recap video (Rangers-Isles). Seems like ever since the NHL.TV switch the highlights have either become an afterthought, or they have 1 unpaid intern that scrambles to get what they can before the caffeine wears off.

It's kind of sad that GDT's are sometimes the only way to see what I've missed. No discredit to the awesome people on this sub that capture/link videos, but how are a bunch of posters that are unpaid and likely several beers deep more motivated to do the job than a multi-billion dollar sports league that has its own PR department and a financial incentive to get people to see what they missed. Even MLB's website has highlights up before midnight, so it's kind of a head-scratcher when they use the same service."

57f5ph,10,2016-10-14,[US-California] Can't find a job...thinking about giving up on accounting.,acctthrowaway4567,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/57f5ph/uscalifornia_cant_find_a_jobthinking_about_giving/,"Hi r/accounting,

So my background is that I graduated in the summer of 2015 from a good school with a 3.5 GPA. Since then I have been working as a state auditor and have passed the CPA exams. I can't think of anything wrong with my resume, except that I only have 1 internship and 1 job on there. Also my interview skills are average (trying to be conservative). Problem is, I've been searching for an entry-level job in public accounting since April to no avail. 

I recently went back to my university to do recruiting there since applying online is not working. Surprisingly, I got straight up rejected by the firms there. I made it clear I'd be willing to wait for next year as well, but it seemed they were more interested in hiring people out of college and weren't even willing to give me a first round interview. I also tried talking to recruiters, but it seems they only have industry jobs available. All of my referrals have lead to dead ends. I'm afraid I'm starting to seem desperate, which isn't helping my interviewing and I'm clueless on my next step. 

I currently despise my job so much that I'm thinking about leaving without anything lined up just because it isn't worth the stress. I'm also dead set on public accounting. If I don't find a public accounting job by the end of this year, I feel like I'm going to have to change careers only 1 year into the real world and after investing so much time and money to take the exam. 

Is anyone else having problems finding a job in this market? I would like to hear how you all are doing this recruiting season as well. Also, please let me know if there are any options that I'm not aware of. Any advice would be great. I'm hoping it is just a bad streak of luck.

Thank you all.

Should you try to work it out? He stayed there most of first period. Finally I had to leave and asked him to leave as well.*

 - *He was in the far corner of the classroom looking out of the window, and was also asking questions. Along the lines of what should one do if they are in love with someone who is not their religion. Should one – should one break up over this, or is love strong enough that it can overcome everything.

57fyzt,0,2016-10-14,F4A - Dark Journey To Fame,Undisclosed_Desires7,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/57fyzt/f4a_dark_journey_to_fame/,"Katheyn or what she preferred to be called Katy was the new intern at the company. A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused.

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

--------------

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (some possibly spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

The prompt above doesn't have to be the start or involved in it... just an example of some writing.

Can be different and have a male celebrity and their journey. (Check out my 'Famous Life' posting in my post history for that)

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Megan Fox, Margot Robbie, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba. Though.. the female celebrity can be an original character that is made up would love her to look like Madison Ivy or Lana Rhoades though also into Lindsey Pelas, Emily Sears and Claudia Alende.

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

P.S Also have a recent posting in which I mention all the rp's and things I'm interested in for a long term rp, so check that out if you want, particularly interested in doing a Marvel Black Widow RP or a Post apocalyptic/dystopia world that is similar to Fallout or a Bioshock rp.

57g1g5,5,2016-10-14,Upcoming internship interview. Oh dear.,Doorjan,aspergers,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/57g1g5/upcoming_internship_interview_oh_dear/,"Hi all, 

I have an interview next week for a year long internship. It's R&amp;D focused, for a very reputable company, and the job suits my skills, interests and qualifications. On paper I'm more qualified and skilled than the other applicants that I know are also doing the interview - so I am very enthusiastic about this opportunity. 

However, simply looking another person in the eye during an interview causes my brain to stop working. I can talk normally while looking elsewhere, but I am sure that the interviewing party will not appreciate that I am having a conversation with the wall. 

Has anyone got any tips, or recommendations for the eye-contact issue, and any other recommendations for getting through an interview successfully? 

I have only recently been diagnosed, and I'm unsure whether to bring this up in the interview. 

Many thanks. "

| **Tonight's Game** |
|:-:|

###***At A Glance:***

*10/14/2016 9:43 AM* *by /u/freecandyvandriver*

Tonight in Minnesota's home opener, Bruce Boudreau looks to see his players right the ship after a weak outing in St. Louis on Thursday.  The challenge will not be easy, however, as an ever-improving Winnipeg side looks to assert themselves in a big way against a Minnesota side that they took 4 wins out of 5 games against last season.  It's not an easy task for Minnesota tonight, and that's going to be the story more often than not this season, as the Central Division as gotten even better this year.

Minnesota was unable to establish a transition game last time out against St. Louis, and Winnipeg aims to do the same by using their size and speed in the neutral zone to even greater effect. Minnesota must find ways of cleanly breaking out of their own zone, and it might take players with speed carrying it out and through the neutral zone to be effective.  Minnesota's default to the ""dump and chase"" failed to be effective in their previous game, and it should be even less effective as Winnipeg tends to send defenders deeper into their own zone.  If the Wild can find an effective balance between dumping with fast wingers and clean passes into the offensive zone, they can establish a presence against a Winnipeg side that punishes teams that hold on to the puck.

Defensively, Minnesota needs to feel comfortable playing the body to disrupt play, even though they are severely out-sized by Winnipeg.  Winnipeg prefers a slower game with occasional breakouts from along the walls, and if Minnesota can force them into passing through the neutral zone and trying to gut it up the ice in the middle of the sheet, Minnesota can find many opportunities for takeaways and odd-man rushes on quick transitions.  Winnipeg uses time in setting up their offense, and Minnesota needs to effectively close down on their opponents while clogging the passing lanes against a Winnipeg team that lacks a ton of creativity to take advantage of those rare chances that would slip through.            

Neither goaltender had a standout game in their season opener, but Dubnyk put in a much stronger game against better opponents than Hellebuyck did against a much weaker side.  If Dubnyk can show up in a big way, that can go a long ways to shoring up at least a point on home ice against a Jets team that is substantially better than most fans give them credit for.

###**Previous Game Recap:** Minnesota [](##MINTINY) 2 - 3 [](##STLTINY) St. Louis  

*10/14/16, 3:25 PM* *by /u/FreeCandyVanDriver*

Minnesota went into the season opener of 2016-'17 the same way they exited the regular season of 2015-'16: the Wild completely failed to find any passion, energy, or effectiveness for two out of the three periods and ended the game with a flurry of energy that screamed ""too little, too late"", as they fell 3-2 against St. Louis.

St. Louis was on the backside of an Away-&amp;-Home stretch, and came out like a team that knew exactly how to stifle Minnesota in all areas of the game.  Holding Minnesota to just 2 shots in the 1st period, St. Louis took it to the Wild in all phases of the game: speed, passing, positioning, and physical play.  Minnesota, lucky to come out of the 1st period only a goal down, found some solid forechecking by the most unlikely of players and capitalized on it.  Ryan Suter was deep in the offensive zone on a casual forecheck, dislodged a Blues defender from the puck, and found his first goal of the season on a rebound attempt that was pure hustle.  Unfortunately, the Wild couldn't keep the game tied for long, and by rights they shouldn't have been tied based on the balance of play. Less than 10 minutes later, newly signed Nail Yakupov of St. Louis got a slapper through a well-positioned Devan Dubnyk, a shot that ended with Dubnyk staring into an empty glove.  After two periods, Minnesota, who was kept in the game by several fantastic save by Dubnyk, headed into the locker room only a goal back.

Sadly, the hope that Minnesota could come out on fire and dominate the 3rd period was not to come to fruition.  Just four minutes into the period, St. Louis notched another one on a nifty cross-ice pass on a three-on-two breakaway that had Dubnyk beat dead to rights.  In yet another moment of déjà vu, Minnesota put themselves within one with seven minutes left to play on a great little one-timer delivered from Zucker right onto Coyle's stick at the edge of the crease.  Making a game of it in the 3rd period, Minnesota finally showed some serious jump. Newly minted Head Coach Bruce Boudreau looked to find a goal from anywhere, getting desperate enough in the 3rd period as to put Chris Stewart on the PP unit.  Outside of that lone Coyle goal, everything in the third failed to translate into results.

St. Louis stifled the pressing attack that came at them for the rest of the game, and Minnesota travels back home leaving two points on the table against a solid Central Division opponent. The players could not be faulted for thinking that all of this -- the little soft goal let in by Dubnyk, the lack of effort in two periods, the dangling of hope as they found themselves a goal back in a 3rd period when they had no legitimate reason to still be in the game, the failure to get that final goal -- it all seems eerily familiar.

###***Wild Notes:***

*10/15/16, 7:37 AM* *by /u/FreeCandyVanDriver*

Minnesota hope that the old adage of ""Home is where the Heart is"" actually means some when they return to St. Paul for their home opener against Winnipeg tonight. After a disappointing loss, the only real talking point with Wild coaches in terms of issues with Thursday's game against St. Louis was ""the little battles"".  Claims of 'Minnesota is as good as anybody when we compete' yesterday by the Wild coaching staff bore a striking resemblance to the claims of former intern coach John Torchetti during his reign.  At minimum, it shows that the Wild didn't magically become a different team in the off-season, at most, it shows that this roster is in the same boat as last year.

Roster looks to be the same, as head coach Bruce Boudreau was keeping the lineup close to his chest yesterday.  It may still be too soon to hear anything about Joel Eriksson-Ek's immigration issues, so don't look for him to make his NHL debut tonight.

Minnesota looked to improve on ""challenges for the puck"" and the PP at practice and during verbal instructions yesterday, but perhaps with time Boudreau can solve the problem that has plagued Minnesota for the better part of 4 seasons.

Speaking of changes that where going to be implemented over the off-season but didn't: Suter's TOI doesn't look to change this season, despite claims that he would see reduced minutes hovering around 25:00-26:00 TOI.  Last season: 28:36 ATOI -- Against St. Louis: 28:11 TOI.

Expect to see Dubnyk in goal tonight as he looks to establish himself soundly in Boudreau's eyes.

I've just finished a year long internship where I was earning €19000 for the year. I've also just finished my masters in software development, and have experience working with pretty in demand technologies in the area of data analytics in an enterprise environment. 

I'm not from Dublin, but I know how expensive it is to live up there, so I would be expecting the area salary to be higher. Is €30k a year reasonable, or too much/little? I know it probably depends on the company too, but just so I get an idea so that I'm not low balling myself when applying for jobs."

57hh9h,408,2016-10-14,UPDATE: My boss [40? 50? M] unfairly extended my [23M] internship.,izzziezzzie,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/57hh9h/update_my_boss_40_50_m_unfairly_extended_my_23m/,"My [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/560329/my_boss_40_50_m_unfairly_extended_my_23m/) got way more responses than I expected.  

I left out a few details that were not relevant.  First, the ""me"" in that post was actually my bf.  He didn't have time to make a post because he was actually working.  He and I read this subreddit religiously and know that we can find great advice here, so I thought why not look for some advice for him as well.  He knew that I was posting this on behalf of him and he read all the responses.  He also used my account to respond to one of the comments.  **Overall it was very very helpful and thank you all SO much for your help.**

Second, the ""employee"" that told my bf that his boss was not allowed to have interns is not just an employee.  He is my bf's cousin and works at a very high position in the larger company.  He told my bf he could ""shut down the entire [small company] if he wanted to.""  He is very busy and my bf is a very independent person, so he did not want his cousin to pull strings for him, he wanted to handle things himself, as best as he could.  He also wanted to keep the job, as it does pay for his grad school tuition.

Following the advice we read from the post, my bf asked his boss for a letter of recommendation, which the boss agreed to write.  He also asked his relative to track down the document that would give my bf something in writing to show his boss, as proof that he was not allowed to have interns.  Our original plan was to write the boss an e-mail (papertrail, as some of you recommended) demanding that my bf no longer be treated as an intern and be paid back in full for his past month of work.  Ultimately my bf was willing to let go of the owed paychecks if his boss was willing to stop extending his internship.

The day my bf asked for the letter of recommendation (essentially the day I made the original post and the day after my bf found out he wasn't supposed to be an intern), work was horrible.  His boss was extra nasty to him at work, giving him workload that was not only beyond his scope of job duty, but also way more than he could handle.  My bf asked his boss what he was doing, and his boss said something along the lines of ""toughening [my bf's] skin"".  He also never wrote the letter of recommendation, and when my bf asked him about it he told my bf that unless he was quitting immediately, he needed to stop asking.  My bf came home very upset and we talked about how we need that document from his cousin ASAP.  But his cousin is, as I mentioned before, extremely busy and has not responded to my bf's texts and calls.  

We spent most of the night discussing what to do and reading over your comments.  By the next morning I mentioned that perhaps some of the comments were correct.  2 extra weeks of internship sucks and what is boss is doing isn't right, but at the end of the day this job is really good.  Having his tuition paid in full saves a ton of money, and the experience he gets from this job is invaluable.  Most importantly, what he does on this job are tasks he planned on doing 5 years down the line, so this job is actually putting him so so much ahead of schedule in terms of his career.  Overall, it simply wasn't worth fighting over 2 extra weeks of internship.  He was going to become a full employee sooner or later.  I told him perhaps to simply wait till the end of the 2 weeks, be super careful not to give his boss another excuse to extend it even more, and to just let it go.  But if his boss tries to extend the internship again, we should do something about it.  My bf agreed.

Surprisingly, he texted me during that same day, telling me his boss not only told him that he was pulling him out of internship immediately, but was also typing up the letter of recommendation (which he agreed to write, but never did).  His boss was also surprisingly nice to him that day.  Everything just sort of worked out.  My bf texted his cousin to thank him for everything (we have no idea if he did anything but we had our suspicions, otherwise why the sudden change of heart from the boss?), and his cousin simply texted back a ""np"".

So that was pretty much the end of it.  My bf is super happy at work again.  He loves this job and he is getting more and more responsibilities.  His confidence is growing, his experience is growing and I am really really proud and happy for him.  Thank you guys for all your help.  We did use a lot of it, and we learned much from it as well.

  **tl;dr**: Boss voluntarily (maybe) pulled ""me"" out of internship the next day.  Everything worked out."
57horr,1,2016-10-14,The trials and tribulations on my first job hunt,Rayne58,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/57horr/the_trials_and_tribulations_on_my_first_job_hunt/,"So I graduated in May and completed an internship in August, and I am having one hell of a time trying to find a job.

I am in the NYC area, my resume has gone through several rounds of critiques on /r/cscareerquestions and /r/resumes, I have 2 internships under my belt doing full stack web development and good projects, I went to a pretty decent school with a decent GPA (3.2) in Computer Science and I am having no luck at all and I am having a really hard time staying motivated since my last denial.

Since August 15th I've applied to about 50 companies, I personalize each resume, and cover letter and really take my time on each application and I've only had 2 interviews, both led to in person interviews and I got denied in both.

The first one, I totally understood why I didn't get the job, I messed up big time on a question about closure in JavaScript and overall didn't vibe well with the team.

But the second interview went so well *(the interview went almost 2 hours over the alloted time, I went out to lunch with the CTO and Chief Data Scientist, I crushed each question and got along so well with each person on the team)* that the fact that I didn't get the job was throughly surprising and demoralizing.

So now I am currently at the point where I applied to most of the jobs that I thought were interesting, I want to do full stack web development, I want to work with more ""modern"" tools, I want to work with a team that can make me a better programmer.  

And it seems like now all that is left are jobs doing Java, or mobile app development and I am really not a fan of Java, nor am I well versed in Java or iOS / Android  development

I guess I feel kind of lost at the moment.  I am sick of doing practice coding questions, I am sick of doing mock interviews (I've done like 15 by now) and I am sick of going all out applying for companies customizing a resume and writing a cover letter that likely what even get read.  

I feel like the timing is all wrong, everyone hired their Jr devs for the year, and most jobs are for more experienced positions, which I apply to (if they say 2 years / mid level) but I obviously get denied / don't hear anything back.

**tldr**: I've been busting my ass, I want a job, I want to program, I want to get over this god forsaken hump.  When I first started applying and until about 2 weeks ago, I was all in, I was waking up at 6am, applying to 2 or so jobs, going to Yoga / Gym, taking JavaScript classes on Udemy and Algorithms on Coursera, meditating regularly and now with this past denial I just feel drained. 

I know I'll get past it and that it's only temporary, I know I'll get a job at some point, I know that I just need to keep on keeping on but shit man, it's definitely been a struggle lately"

Is it intentional, is it a bug? Please let us know that you have heard us on this issue. There have been several posts regarding the topic the past few weeks. We have had two TWABS with no mention of it in known issues. Like seriously at this point I just want to know what's going on. If it on purpose that sucks but at least I know. If it is a bug then sweet I have something to look forward. But please just let us know you hear us on this issue acknowledge it.

Edit Silly thought occurred on my drive home. So week one of ROI. Bungie is like people have saved legendary engrams lets not add the new weapons to the loot table for Legendary engrams. ""Fred add them in next Tuesday"" Bungie Devs say to Fred the intern. But then the intended Tuesday, Fred's girlfriend said that her parents aren't home so he went on over and they started getting busy. However, dad got home early from his business trip and walked in on Fred who was then unable to escape. Fred now missing due to mysterious reasons was unable to add the new weapons to the engram loot pool. RIP Fred the intern you were our only hope."
57hym6,6,2016-10-14,Looking for support (ex-gf has bpd looking back.),im_intj,BPD,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/57hym6/looking_for_support_exgf_has_bpd_looking_back/,"I don't know really where to begin... so I just will, hopefully writing this will help me out emotionally. 
I first met my ex online my senior year of high school in 2009 when I was 18 and she was 16. When we first met it was awesome I would talk to her forever and we would remain in contact even though we lived almost on opposite sides of the country. During that time she would go through periods where she would stop talking to me but would always come back and make excuses that made no sense as to why she behaved like that. This behavior should have been a huge red flag for what was to come however this whole time I loved this girl with all of my heart and cared about her more than words can describe. 

Fast forward to 2011 things seemed to be going good between us and we were discussing meeting in person for the first time. At the end of 2011 I made the leap and flew out to see her for the first time and we soon were in an official relationship. Going into 2012 I knew I would have to move closer if I wanted to make this relationship work and knowing that I loved her and never wanted to be with another girl I moved to where she lived in the summer of 2012. 

Within the first week of being around her in person I knew something was strange about her but could never pinpoint it. It was like I was on a nonstop emotional roller coaster. She would go ballistic over the smallest things and never thought about my needs. It seemed like her selfish behavior was the only thing that mattered and this whole time I tried to help her out of it. It is really hard to describe all the small details of her behavior but all the symptoms of BPD were there and since finding out about this disorder its like the wool has been peeled from my eyes. 

After moving to her I worked my ass off so I could get a good job and we could build a future together. However, nothing was ever good enough for her and I started blaming myself. I tried to help her as much as I could while working full time and working on my degree. 

In 2013, a year after I moved to her she left for a study abroad program in a country on the other side of the world, this is where things took a huge nosedive. Immediately after arriving she barely contacted me and started partying every chance she got. A month after she arrived she had broken up with me and I was at the lowest point in my life. A week went by after her breaking up with me and she was contacting me wanting to get back together and I agreed only because I loved her and wanted to save things. A month goes by and I find out only by pressing her hard about the issue that she had slept with a random guy she had just met. After this stuff happened her attitude had changed and it seemed like she was back to her normal self. 

After coming back to the states after being gone for six months I flew 6 hrs to the other side of the country to surprise and meet her on her arrival back. It seemed after she came back that everything was going to be alright. Something told me she was not telling me the whole truth so I looked at chat logs and found out she had slept with two other guys during the week she broke up with me and was talking to multiple others during this period. I was devastated and was mentally exhausted I finally had a breakdown. 

She did what she always did and tried to reassure me and told me what I wanted to hear so for some reason I accepted what she had told me and continued to be with her. 

A couple more years go by after that incident and I had finished my associates degree, landed a really great job making great money, and was pursuing to finish my bachelor's. I was at the best peak of my life and felt like nothing could mess up the momentum I had going for me. 

Than this last May my ex started an internship at a hospital and after two weeks of being there she had told me she met some guy who liked the same music as her, was in the same field as her, and she felt really happy about him. After everything I had done for her she dumped me again to be with someone she had only met two weeks prior. 

I was devastated, I was so depressed I was thinking about ending everything because of the pain I was in. I removed her from every form of social media and began to try to heal from all the pain from the previous 5 years of pain. During this period she never once contacted me except to try to get some furniture back from my house. 

Fast forward to this week she starts trying to add me on snap chat and I ignore her. This whole time she is looking at the pictures I am posting like nothing ever happened. Later this week my friend finds her profile on Tinder and told me what was up. I can only assume that the guy she left me for is no longer in the picture. 

I am so broken over this relationship. Its like she has two different personalities but at the same time does not even have one. I know when she is well she is awesome but when she starts loosing it, it is like nothing matters and she will run over anyone in the way. I still care about her to this day and I don't think that will ever leave me. I really do not know how to handle all of this. 

Does anyone with experience know what the best thing to do regarding her is? I do not have this disorder so I can only imagine what is going through her mind on any given moment.

57hyzq,23,2016-10-14,Bidding Season,BrassAge,foreignservice,https://www.reddit.com/r/foreignservice/comments/57hyzq/bidding_season/,"When you first join the foreign service, you take advantage of a system called ""directed assignment"".  This means that you're given a list by your Career Development Officer showing the available jobs, you winnow it down to those that work well for you given timing of language training, functional training, and estimated time of departure from your previous position, and then you rank order those positions that make sense.

Your CDO, and other CDOs, all get together to decide which officer will go where.  Theoretically, they weigh your preferences along with your overall strategy, and do their best to put as many people into jobs they want as possible.  It is not perfect, nor entirely transparent, but it removes most of the burden from the officers themselves and ensures that positions are staffed according to department priorities.

Once you become a mid level officer, you're on the hook for doing most of this work yourself.  All the order goes out the window.  The time of year when you do this, called bidding season, is going on as we speak.

When it's time to find your next job as a mid level officer, you're responsible for reaching out to post, finding references who will speak to your qualifications, and convincing the ""decision-maker' at your next post to fall in love with you.  It is not unlike internet dating, and you have to do it frequently, so it behooves you to be good at it.

Timing still matters most of all, but this is where your ""corridor reputation"" really starts to become important.  If you've already made a strong impression on someone at your proposed new post, that heavily influences your chances of being selected for a job there.

In my current bidding cycle, some of my preferred jobs have upwards of 40 bidders, against whom I'm competing for a single position.  Without some incredibly compelling relationship, recommendation or qualification, it's impossible to distinguish yourself.  This is why you'll often hear discussions about bidding turn ugly -- almost no one enjoys the process of selling themselves, nor do they enjoy the process of winnowing candidates based on limited information, but that's the system we have.

This part of the career, the long mid-career, is where things like your likability, your prior work experience, your reputation, your ability with languages, and your professional connections all work in your favor.  These are all things people new to the process erroneously assume will help them in the application process, and they're quickly rebuffed in this sub.

Many folks come to this sub looking for advice about what to study or where to work to give them the best shot at the foreign service, and the answer is always the same: exhibit the 13 dimensions as best you can.

That said, the skills you pick up in grad school, in internships, in NGO work, in private industry, or in your own unique life can all be employed later down the road to help you make friends, succeed in your job, and eventually land the next job you want within the department.  Keep working on the 13 dimensions, keep practicing with your OA group, but also take some time to ensure that the skills you're learning to fill out a resume are skills you can use later in your career.  You'll be a better diplomat for it."

57i2j3,1,2016-10-14,"PLEASE HELP! 26, go back to wildlife bio or stick with communications/new media?",PapayaNuevo,biology,https://www.reddit.com/r/biology/comments/57i2j3/please_help_26_go_back_to_wildlife_bio_or_stick/,"Dear Reddit,

I am basically struggling with a decision. 

I graduated from a top US public university in 2012. I had dreamed of becoming a wildlife biologist, but could not pass a math class due to a later-discovered learning disability (that, had I known about, I could have gotten special accommodations with). I had spent my three years engrossed in research outside of class and was fine in statistics, but was having difficulty passing pre-calculus. I was kicked out of the major in my third year and basically graduated depressed and with no idea what I was going to do.  My entire resume was based on the idea that I would go to graduate school for wildlife biology, with research outside of class, internships at the park service, etc every summer. 

Basically, my life was destroyed. I ended up graduating with a BA in Environmental studies and a minor in conservation biology. My major advisors told me that because I was unable to pass the series needed for the BS, I would have 0 chance at ever becoming a wildlife biologist, and I should just give up my dream completely, because I would NEVER be able to enter a master’s program. I was so depressed and I just lied and told everyone I had just lost interest in the field, because I was so embarrassed about my difficulties passing this class and so tired of people telling me I was “just lazy” and if I just “Tried harder” I could have passed.

My research advisors were furious, and disowned me, and told me I was making a huge mistake, and never wanted to talk to me again. 

The next four years were awful. I couldn’t get employed for 7 months after graduation beyond tutoring, and was  depressed enough to go to some very dark places because I had no idea what I was going to do, thinking that I was hopeless and just hating myself for having failed on my dream, and feeling deep despair.  I taught English in Europe for a year and a half, and basically ended up doing communications and marketing in nonprofits. I’m a talented writer and graphic designer, so it was easy for me to learn this occupation, but it is definitely not my passion. It was basically the only thing I could learn quickly enough on my own to get a job. 

I am now almost 27, and after my three years of communications and marketing experience at nonprofits being pretty awful, I ‘m applying for normal businesses. The salaries I’m getting quoted now in interviews are lucrative, in the 70k-80k range.

HOWEVER, I don’t like what I’m doing. I know how to do it, but it’s not my passion. After so many years of barely scraping by and having to rely on my parents, the idea of actually making a living is a godsend.

By chance last year, I found out that basically what my advisors told me at my school was not correct. I was looking at master’s degrees in Europe (where I would like to go), and I found out that actually, I WOULD have been able to apply straight to a master’s and then a PhD with my degree, despite not having taken the pre-determinded BS path that all the pre-med students at my universities took. When I found this out, my heart broke, because I felt like at that point…based on some very bad advice, I had wasted the last 4 years of my life. I tried so hard to convince myself that I didn’t want to be a wildlife biologist because I was told it was impossible. So I just convinced myself and everyone around me that I just didn’t want to do that path anymore. 

Now I just don’t know what to do. My dream job would be to be researcher at an NGO directing a project, living in a major European city, traveling a lot.. I would love to go back and get that master’s and PhD, but now I am almost 27. Had I not received that horrible advice back in undergrad, I would have gone straight to grad school. I know that pay in wildlife bio is really bad, and I will most likely have to bounce around, moving from place to place, with really low paid seasonal jobs until I am able to get my dream job at an NGO or nonprofit, or working at some sort of institute. I would like to live in or near a major city.

When I was fresh out of college, no problem! Now I am almost 27 and I am just very worried about this prospect. Getting a masters, and then living on minimum wage, never being in the same place for too long.. I do want to get married, start a family at some point. I have been so stressed out being so poor for so long. I feel like whichever choice I make, I lose. I’m trying to get a Polish passport at the moment through my grandparents but it’s a very long and complicated process. My other plan was to do a master’s in Europe and try to get married there for a visa. 

These are my choices:
1.	Stick in my current career, marketing and communications. Try to develop some skills in an area I like better (more creative stuff, video, design, etc). I am a very talented writer when I am working professionally and also a talented and passionate artist/visual designer. Make good money, not worry about money, be able to live in a major city, move back to Europe. Basically have the life I want, but not pursue my passion that I’ve had since childhood and engulfs me..animals, and the environment, and travel…
I thought maybe what I could do was switch to some sort of media production and try to make media about the environment or wildlife. But maybe I would regret that I wasn’t doing science for the rest of my life?? I don’t know. 

2.	Apply for a master’s in something related to wildlife or environmental studies (since I highly doubt I would be accepted into a PhD program straight, having been out of the field for so long). I would probably be 27 or 28 by the time I started. Since, from what I understand, the types of jobs I would want are only attainable with a phd, I would go to a European PhD program By the time my schooling would be done, I would be 33. I might not get the job I want (and pay beyond minimum wage) until I’m 40. 

I honestly can’t figure out what route to decide. Please help. I have been getting panic attacks over this. I feel so confused, I don't even know what I want anymore, because I've spent so long trying to force myself to do stuff I don't like.

57i4ia,6,2016-10-14,Please help! Go back to wildlife bio or stick with communications/new media?,PapayaNuevo,wildlifeecology,https://www.reddit.com/r/wildlifeecology/comments/57i4ia/please_help_go_back_to_wildlife_bio_or_stick_with/,"Dear Reddit,

I am basically struggling with a decision. 

I graduated from a top US public university in 2012. I had dreamed of becoming a wildlife biologist, but could not pass a math class due to a later-discovered learning disability (that, had I known about, I could have gotten special accommodations with). I had spent my three years engrossed in research outside of class and was fine in statistics, but was having difficulty passing pre-calculus. I was kicked out of the major in my third year and basically graduated depressed and with no idea what I was going to do.  My entire resume was based on the idea that I would go to graduate school for wildlife biology, with research outside of class, internships at the park service, etc every summer. 

Basically, my life was destroyed. I ended up graduating with a BA in Environmental studies and a minor in conservation biology. My major advisors told me that because I was unable to pass the series needed for the BS, I would have 0 chance at ever becoming a wildlife biologist, and I should just give up my dream completely, because I would NEVER be able to enter a master’s program. I was so depressed and I just lied and told everyone I had just lost interest in the field, because I was so embarrassed about my difficulties passing this class and so tired of people telling me I was “just lazy” and if I just “Tried harder” I could have passed.

My research advisors were furious, and disowned me, and told me I was making a huge mistake, and never wanted to talk to me again. 

The next four years were awful. I couldn’t get employed for 7 months after graduation beyond tutoring, and was  depressed enough to go to some very dark places because I had no idea what I was going to do, thinking that I was hopeless and just hating myself for having failed on my dream, and feeling deep despair.  I taught English in Europe for a year and a half, and basically ended up doing communications and marketing in nonprofits. I’m a talented writer and graphic designer, so it was easy for me to learn this occupation, but it is definitely not my passion. It was basically the only thing I could learn quickly enough on my own to get a job. 

I am now almost 27, and after my three years of communications and marketing experience at nonprofits being pretty awful, I ‘m applying for normal businesses. The salaries I’m getting quoted now in interviews are lucrative, in the 70k-80k range.

HOWEVER, I don’t like what I’m doing. I know how to do it, but it’s not my passion. After so many years of barely scraping by and having to rely on my parents, the idea of actually making a living is a godsend.

By chance last year, I found out that basically what my advisors told me at my school was not correct. I was looking at master’s degrees in Europe (where I would like to go), and I found out that actually, I WOULD have been able to apply straight to a master’s and then a PhD with my degree, despite not having taken the pre-determinded BS path that all the pre-med students at my universities took. When I found this out, my heart broke, because I felt like at that point…based on some very bad advice, I had wasted the last 4 years of my life. I tried so hard to convince myself that I didn’t want to be a wildlife biologist because I was told it was impossible. So I just convinced myself and everyone around me that I just didn’t want to do that path anymore. 

Now I just don’t know what to do. My dream job would be to be researcher at an NGO directing a project, living in a major European city, traveling a lot.. I would love to go back and get that master’s and PhD, but now I am almost 27. Had I not received that horrible advice back in undergrad, I would have gone straight to grad school. I know that pay in wildlife bio is really bad, and I will most likely have to bounce around, moving from place to place, with really low paid seasonal jobs until I am able to get my dream job at an NGO or nonprofit, or working at some sort of institute. I would like to live in or near a major city.

When I was fresh out of college, no problem! Now I am almost 27 and I am just very worried about this prospect. Getting a masters, and then living on minimum wage, never being in the same place for too long.. I do want to get married, start a family at some point. I have been so stressed out being so poor for so long. I feel like whichever choice I make, I lose. I’m trying to get a Polish passport at the moment through my grandparents but it’s a very long and complicated process. My other plan was to do a master’s in Europe and try to get married there for a visa. 

These are my choices:
1.	Stick in my current career, marketing and communications. Try to develop some skills in an area I like better (more creative stuff, video, design, etc). I am a very talented writer when I am working professionally and also a talented and passionate artist/visual designer. Make good money, not worry about money, be able to live in a major city, move back to Europe. Basically have the life I want, but not pursue my passion that I’ve had since childhood and engulfs me..animals, and the environment, and travel…

I might not get the job I want (and pay beyond minimum wage) until I’m 40. 

I honestly can’t figure out what route to decide. Please help. I have been getting panic attacks over this. I just don't even know what I want anymore, after so many years of struggling.

when julia texted me and asked if i got an interview. i said i had not yet gotten anything, in truth i had received a reply back and got an interview. 


i feel wrong for lying to her but at the same time i hate to have 10 of my friends all applying for the same job and then the feeling of jealousy when they get the job and i don't.


what do you normally do? Advice welcome!

EDIT i applied earlier in the year and was rejected this is my second application to a different company

57jskm,2,2016-10-14,F4A - The Dark Journey To Fame,Undisclosed_Desires7,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/57jskm/f4a_the_dark_journey_to_fame/,"Katheyn or what she preferred to be called Katy was the new intern at the company. A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused.

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

-----------

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (some possibly spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

The prompt above doesn't have to be the start or involved in it... just an example of some writing.

Can be different and have a male celebrity and their journey. (Check out my 'Famous Life' posting in my post history for that)

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Megan Fox, Margot Robbie, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba. Though.. the female celebrity can be an original character that is made up would love her to look like Madison Ivy or Lana Rhoades though also into Lindsey Pelas, Emily Sears and Claudia Alende.

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

P.S Also have a recent posting in which I mention all the rp's and things I'm interested in for a long term rp, so check that out if you want, particularly interested in doing a Marvel Black Widow RP or a Post apocalyptic/dystopia world that is similar to Fallout or a Bioshock rp. Also a Walking Dead rp.

57kmxc,1,2016-10-15,Ichor - The Blood of The Gods,AccioIcarus,AntiHeroReborn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiHeroReborn/comments/57kmxc/ichor_the_blood_of_the_gods/,"Name: Sam Sharma

Codename: Ichor

Age: chronologically 36, biologically 26

 [Appearance:](http://i.imgur.com/t4As1HT.jpg) 

* Hair: Black, long, can be messy
* Eyes: Dark Brown, hint of gold. They appear to be fully gold through his suit.
* Skin: light brown
* Body: Has lean muscles, somewhat tall.  He has some scars on his body from his time kidnapped and from various battles.
* [Supersuit:](https://i.imgur.com/BBsBgyF.png)  His supersuit is armored with tiny gaps for the blood to flow through. His armored gloves have separated fingers, allowing him to have greater control of his blood manipulation. His legs are a little more armored because the majority of his attacks go through his hands.  The feet of his soles are made of a rough metal in order to get better grip on slick surfaces.  His suit is made out of a porous alloy that is as strong as titanium but has the weight of Aluminum.  It is reinforced underneath with a carbon fiber weave, allowing him to use his armor as storage channels for his blood.  He is able to harden his blood inside the suit, strengthening it further.

* When not wearing his super suit, he likes to wear a graphic t-shirt and jeans.  He wears his suit during public appearances.

Personality: Despite his macabre power, he is usually really laid back and enjoys having fun. He has a very odd sense of humor and tends to speak first and think later when with friends. He can be very persuasive, and loves strategy.  He tends to be a very warm and friendly person, but can be outright intimidating if he doesn't trust you. He is kind of nerdy as well despite his years in battle, and loves to make pop culture references.  Sometimes even during mission briefings. He can be very serious if needs to be and has gotten more serious throughout the years.  He essentially has two modes: battle-hardened veteran and perky manchild.

Backstory: Growing up in Florida to immigrant parents, Sam was an outcast.  Despite being born and raised in Florida, he was always the foreign kid.  He didn't have many friends, either.  Except for a select few, everyone saw him as that one weird brown kid that didn’t know how to talk to people.  Instead, he turned to science and books.  He’d spend his days in the fantasy land of a book or game, or researching a new theory in biochemistry.  As time went on, he cultivated a reputation as the resident nerd of the school.  
All that changed when he was 13 years old, when Mexico and Canada declared war.  Like pretty much every place close to the borders, he was caught in the crossfire.  Suddenly, Canadian sympathizers were accusing him of helping Mexico.  Despite not actually being Mexican, he was caught up in Anti-Mexican sentiment due to his looks.  This drove him closer into his research, where he spent most of his time.  He graduated high school at the age of 17 and immediately began an internship with Booster Tech in the biological research division, where he studied biology based powers for potential artificial power creation.  

 The next year, war broke out once again: the Mexican-Canadian war became a world war when more countries joined in to support their allies. Living in Florida, he was all too aware of the effects of the war.  This time, it was the other side that hated him.  One day, while walking back to his place from work, he was ambushed by men shouting at him in Spanish.  When he woke up, he was more than 4000 miles away in Spain.  He spent the few weeks as a human punching bag for Spanish nationalists before breaking out.  

One day, upon waking up in the dark, humid cell that he was being kept in, something clicked in him.  He could feel liquid rushing through his body, pulsing with every beat his heart took.  After cutting his hand on a particularly sharp rock, he noticed that the cut on his hand wasn’t bleeding red.  It was covered with a shimmering golden substance.  His very blood itself had changed.  After a week or two of constant practice, he was able to control his new powers with some confidence.  The very next day, he escaped in a surprise attack.  Not one person was spared.

After a few uneasy weeks of blending in to the surrounding area and adjusting to his new life as a super, he received the news: The war was finally over.  Then, a few weeks later came another surprise: A large aircraft carrier had docked itself in Vigo.  It was definitely not a Spanish model ship.  His new neighbors had tensed up.  Did the ship not get the message that the war was over?  After a few days came another surprise: the identity of the sailors.  Emboldened by this new opportunity, Sam went to go check it out.  Finally, he would have a chance to be where he belonged.

-------

After helping his allies on board the HCMS Phantom Shadow defeat the Purifiers, Ichor received a chance to lead when the leaders stepped down in order to pursue other ventures.  As a newly elected Squad leader, he was given joint control of the ship.  Along with the other squad leaders, he founded Cape City around the site of the Phantom Shadow.  As a place where super powered individuals could live in peace with regular people, it quickly became a bustling city.  Eventually SPECTRUM sprung out of the former squads, with Ichor as one of its leaders, as an organization that could work all around the world to preserve this peace. Due to the Death Rose attacks, he has since become slightly more serious.

_____
Power: Hemokinesis.

He can shape, control, and manipulate blood. He is even able to compact and crystallize the blood. He possesses overactive Bone Marrow, which replenishes the blood at much faster rates than normal. This gives him massive amounts of blood to use at his disposal and gives him superhuman healing (about 3-4X the normal speed). Due to his mutation, his blood is an extremely efficient carrier of oxygen and nutrients. He has some conscious control of the blood while it is still inside his body, and is able to manipulate the flow of blood to different areas of the body to rapidly increase healing in these parts.  He is able to pull the blood straight from the pores of his skin.  The blood that he uses in battle is a golden color rather than a dark-red, as a result of his mutations. Any crystallized blood will evaporate into a harmless vapor after about half an hour.  He is able to create some bio-luminescent pigments in his blood, and uses this to make tracer rounds or to mark enemies.  He can create light at the intensity of about 200 candelas.  The texture of the hardened blood can be manipulated to be hard and crystallized or jelly-like, or anywhere in between.  Also, his mutant blood has made him age slower than normal.  He ages at speeds a little between 1/2 and 1/3rd that of a regular person.

He has perfected various techniques over years of practice:

* Blood Blaster: He is able to shoot blood bullets of different sizes and shapes from his hands. This is one of his most used attacks, and can fire at speeds up to that of a Sub Machine Gun (about 1000 RPM) At low speeds he is able to change the direction of the bullet in midair. However, the blood cannot be reused once it hits its target.  This ability can rapidly deplete blood if he's not careful.
* Blood Blade: He is able to create blades of varying size and shape out of blood that can attach to various body parts. He is able to create a sort of inner webbing in the blade to minimize blood loss while extending the blade. The blades are about as sharp and durable as steel, and can break. The broken end is still controllable.  He can combine this with his Blood Blaster to create streams of razor blades.
* Blood Bulwark: He is able create protective armor out of the blood. The armor is as tough as steel and can be detached from his skin to form a mobile shield. He is able to create the armor anywhere on his body, and the armor can be detached. He often uses it on his arms as kind of an accompaniment to the protection already offered by the guards on the Katar that he uses.  He also uses this in conjunction with his blood blades to create blood claws.
* Blood Bullwhip: He is able to elongate his blood armor into a flexible whip that extends out of the front of his hands. The whip is about as tough as leather and is used to hold on to objects. He prefers to use this for functional purposes.  
  * Blood Brambles: He places spikes on the end of his whips, allowing him to use them offensively.
* Blood Brand: He is able to transfer heat from a heat source using the blood, allowing him to burn or even melt objects if the heat source is hot enough.

Drawbacks: His hemokinesis requires warm temperatures to function correctly, so he is weakened considerably by cold temperatures. He finds it hard to use his blood manipulation in the cold because doing so drastically lowers his body temperature.  He can only manipulate his own blood or fluid that is at least partially made up of his own blood. With the latter, however, he has diminished control depending on how much blood is in the fluid. He is unable to redirect that blood back inside his body, so it is lost after battle.  He has to consume massive amounts of calories as well as iron supplements to account for his massive blood production. He has no control over how much blood is produced, so he has to use his powers often to prevent himself from getting hypertension.  The golden blood that he uses in battle is very distinctive and can be identified easily, especially when it is glowing. His armor is short lived due to solidified blood evaporating after use.  Blood contaminated by anything that would kill his hyper-active blood cells is not usable. Overusing his abilities risks his blood becoming deoxygenated, which can suffocate him.  He is extra susceptible to the effects of poisons. 

Resistances: He is resistant to heat.  He is resistant to physical attacks due to his blood closing up the wound easily and his healing factor.

Weapon: He owns a [pair of Katar](https://i.imgur.com/JmKcRNE.jpg) that he uses as a short-range weapon and to extend the use of his powers.  These katar have channels in them that he can use as barrels to steady his aim for long range attacks.

Special Skills: He is a good strategist and is an expert at biology as well as biochemistry and chemistry.  He is skilled at first aid, and used to be a Doctor before he became a full-time hero.  He is a master of his fighting style and is skilled at the use of his Katar. He is a great talker, and is skilled at making people feel at ease. He is great at all kinds of videogames.

57kp40,23,2016-10-15,I want to share another victory of mine to show you guys that it does get better,donebeingsalty,ExNoContact,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/57kp40/i_want_to_share_another_victory_of_mine_to_show/,"Hey guys,

Like always a quick intro on me: My ex dumped me while I was recovering from spinal surgery so I was stuck on bed rest for a whole month. It was incredibly hard to cope.  I tried to convince her to get her back on September 19th but failed (thank god).

Anyway, I recently shared that I have a date Saturday night.  I met a nice girl who just moved to my city from the west coast.  I'm looking forward to that.

But now I have a new victory to share. I met another girl today and I like her too! Probably more than the girl I have a date with tomorrow.  She worked as an intern in my office and today was her last day. For some reason I just met her today.  Since we technically work together I wasn't trying to flirt with her but the chemistry was undeniable.

I was pretty shy about asking her out on the spot or even asking for her number.  So I wrote my number on a piece of paper and told her we should keep in touch. She left the office and she literally texted me 5 minutes later.  I'm so excited!

The part that I'm so excited about is I haven't been thinking about my ex.  My Friday night routine has consisted of being sad and thinking of my ex.  But tonight I'm really happy and I can't stop thinking about the 2nd girl.  I didn't notice I stopped thinking about my ex until my subconscious reminded me. I was like, ""Oh shit you're right!""

And you know what? I don't care! I'm moving on!

For those of you stuck in a rut, please know that it does get better.  You just have to give it time. Time heals all wounds.  Time and patience is key!"

So much to say that I love him brings tears to my eyes. I love you to death. I'd love to be with you right now. I saw him at track meet when he ran that 400x2. He's so dedicated to running and it makes him seem very sexy... Our table as usual where he kissed me and sighed when I drove away from him. Then we're gone. I know, as I always have, that Adnan's warm smile is the one I can't live without. You love the one you can't live without. I can't imagine my life without his smile, his (??), and most importantly, his love. I feel so guilty though -- about Don. I don't know why in the hell I have such thoughts. It's all because of (??) and her ideas. I really kind of wanted to tell Adnan about the whole Don thing, but I was so afraid. What if it pushes him away? Will he (??) me? Will he still love me? I would die without his love. I will just keep it a secret. But what if he finds out and hates me? No I can't tell him. He wouldn't forgive me because I don't forgive myself. I can't believe myself at all. Maybe I should commit suicide. Should I get on my knees and beg forgiveness? Would he forgive me, or would he build up his walls again? I love you so much, Adnan. What have I done? Why do I keep hurting you? I swear I don't mean to. Can't you find it in your heart to forgive me? You're my one and only forever.*

On Thursday, December 31st I picked up Adnan from his work and dropped him off at Sears so he could pick up his car. I thought of waiting for him to but some reason I had to go up to Owings Mills Mall. When I got there I saw his Camaro, which was surprising since he wasn't working that day. When I was going to pull up next to his car, he was walking towards his car. I stopped and talked to him, flirting around with him as usual. Well, he actually let me drive his car around Owings Mills Mall. What a car. Well, we flirted around a little more. Finally, decided to for dinner on the first. I mean, what a day to start a new year. Well, I got to work on the first week. I spent the New Year's Eve at Aisha's with Krista and the crew, Amber, Becky, Dee (Debbie), Sean and Ryan, but the guys had to leave at two. But I fell asleep around one because I had to wake up at nine to get to work. When I got to work, Don was there of course. He is so cute and funny. Cool, I found my favorite pen. Anyways, he changed into a green sweater and jeans. His sweater made his green eyes look so incredible, since his eyes turn green to blue to grey. He has real beautiful eyes, real beautiful. Well, after work we went all of the way up to Aberdeen. We got to the Olive Tree where we sat and ate. I had crab cake which was really good, I loved it. Me and Don had a fun conversation. We were talking about a lot of things from Lenscrafters to cars to his name, Donald Robert Klinedinst III. Wow, I don't think I've ever felt this weird before but I really do think I like him. We came back to the Owings Mills Mall and we just sat and talked. I really wanted him to kiss me but not -- he's too much of a gentleman for that. Wow, what a guy. He was so kind, caring, intelligent, incredibly cute, funny, amusing, and very down to earth.*

“What the fuck is a ‘based centipede?’” He said in English.
“They’re American insurgents, O Sultan of the Swedes,” sniveled a baby-faced intern.
“What the fuck are they doing in Sweden, Carl?” Al-Taharrush’s brows were risen in fury.  Blue-eyed Carl cringed and smiled.
“It has something to do with the ‘prophecy of the first female President.’ They’re fanatics who claim that Ronald Reagan was the last real President, every President after that was really an anti-President.  They’re looking for Trump’s daughter.”

##**Tonight's Game**

###***At A Glance:***

*10/14/2016 9:43 AM* *by /u/freecandyvandriver*

Tonight in Minnesota's home opener, Bruce Boudreau looks to see his players right the ship after a weak outing in St. Louis on Thursday.  The challenge will not be easy, however, as an ever-improving Winnipeg side looks to assert themselves in a big way against a Minnesota side that they took 4 wins out of 5 games against last season.  It's not an easy task for Minnesota tonight, and that's going to be the story more often than not this season, as the Central Division as gotten even better this year.

Minnesota was unable to establish a transition game last time out against St. Louis, and Winnipeg aims to do the same by using their size and speed in the neutral zone to even greater effect. Minnesota must find ways of cleanly breaking out of their own zone, and it might take players with speed carrying it out and through the neutral zone to be effective.  Minnesota's default to the ""dump and chase"" failed to be effective in their previous game, and it should be even less effective as Winnipeg tends to send defenders deeper into their own zone.  If the Wild can find an effective balance between dumping with fast wingers and clean passes into the offensive zone, they can establish a presence against a Winnipeg side that punishes teams that hold on to the puck.

Defensively, Minnesota needs to feel comfortable playing the body to disrupt play, even though they are severely out-sized by Winnipeg.  Winnipeg prefers a slower game with occasional breakouts from along the walls, and if Minnesota can force them into passing through the neutral zone and trying to gut it up the ice in the middle of the sheet, Minnesota can find many opportunities for takeaways and odd-man rushes on quick transitions.  Winnipeg uses time in setting up their offense, and Minnesota needs to effectively close down on their opponents while clogging the passing lanes against a Winnipeg team that lacks a ton of creativity to take advantage of those rare chances that would slip through.            

Neither goaltender had a standout game in their season opener, but Dubnyk put in a much stronger game against better opponents than Hellebuyck did against a much weaker side.  If Dubnyk can show up in a big way, that can go a long ways to shoring up at least a point on home ice against a Jets team that is substantially better than most fans give them credit for.

##**Last Time Out:**

###**Previous Game Recap:** Minnesota [](##MINTINY) 2 - 3 [](##STLTINY) St. Louis  

*10/14/16, 3:25 PM* *by /u/FreeCandyVanDriver*

Minnesota went into the season opener of 2016-'17 the same way they exited the regular season of 2015-'16: the Wild completely failed to find any passion, energy, or effectiveness for two out of the three periods and ended the game with a flurry of energy that screamed ""too little, too late"", as they fell 3-2 against St. Louis.

St. Louis was on the backside of an Away-&amp;-Home stretch, and came out like a team that knew exactly how to stifle Minnesota in all areas of the game.  Holding Minnesota to just 2 shots in the 1st period, St. Louis took it to the Wild in all phases of the game: speed, passing, positioning, and physical play.  Minnesota, lucky to come out of the 1st period only a goal down, found some solid forechecking by the most unlikely of players and capitalized on it.  Ryan Suter was deep in the offensive zone on a casual forecheck, dislodged a Blues defender from the puck, and found his first goal of the season on a rebound attempt that was pure hustle.  Unfortunately, the Wild couldn't keep the game tied for long, and by rights they shouldn't have been tied based on the balance of play. Less than 10 minutes later, newly signed Nail Yakupov of St. Louis got a slapper through a well-positioned Devan Dubnyk, a shot that ended with Dubnyk staring into an empty glove.  After two periods, Minnesota, who was kept in the game by several fantastic save by Dubnyk, headed into the locker room only a goal back.

Sadly, the hope that Minnesota could come out on fire and dominate the 3rd period was not to come to fruition.  Just four minutes into the period, St. Louis notched another one on a nifty cross-ice pass on a three-on-two breakaway that had Dubnyk beat dead to rights.  In yet another moment of déjà vu, Minnesota put themselves within one with seven minutes left to play on a great little one-timer delivered from Zucker right onto Coyle's stick at the edge of the crease.  Making a game of it in the 3rd period, Minnesota finally showed some serious jump. Newly minted Head Coach Bruce Boudreau looked to find a goal from anywhere, getting desperate enough in the 3rd period as to put Chris Stewart on the PP unit.  Outside of that lone Coyle goal, everything in the third failed to translate into results.

St. Louis stifled the pressing attack that came at them for the rest of the game, and Minnesota travels back home leaving two points on the table against a solid Central Division opponent. The players could not be faulted for thinking that all of this -- the little soft goal let in by Dubnyk, the lack of effort in two periods, the dangling of hope as they found themselves a goal back in a 3rd period when they had no legitimate reason to still be in the game, the failure to get that final goal -- it all seems eerily familiar.

###***Wild Notes:***

*10/15/16, 7:37 AM* *by /u/FreeCandyVanDriver*

Minnesota hope that the old adage of ""Home is where the Heart is"" actually means something when they return to St. Paul for their home opener against Winnipeg tonight. After a disappointing loss, the only real talking point with Wild coaches in terms of issues with Thursday's game against St. Louis was ""the little battles"".  Claims of 'Minnesota is as good as anybody when we compete' yesterday by the Wild coaching staff bore a striking resemblance to the claims of former intern coach John Torchetti during his reign.  At minimum, it shows that the Wild didn't magically become a different team in the off-season, at most, it shows that this roster is in the same boat as last year.

Roster looks to be the same, as head coach Bruce Boudreau was keeping the lineup close to his chest yesterday.  It may still be too soon to hear anything about Joel Eriksson-Ek's immigration issues, so don't look for him to make his NHL debut tonight.

Minnesota looked to improve on ""challenges for the puck"" and the PP at practice and during verbal instructions yesterday, but perhaps with time Boudreau can solve the problem that has plagued Minnesota for the better part of 4 seasons.

Speaking of changes that where going to be implemented over the off-season but didn't: Suter's TOI doesn't look to change this season, despite claims that he would see reduced minutes hovering around 25:00-26:00 TOI.  Last season: 28:36 ATOI -- Against St. Louis: 28:11 TOI.

Expect to see Dubnyk in goal tonight as he looks to establish himself soundly in Boudreau's eyes.

57mwy9,0,2016-10-15,And that's why I like Python better.,I_Am_The_Coach,java,https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/57mwy9/and_thats_why_i_like_python_better/,"I'd like to tell a story.

My background is not in programming or Computer Science, but in a physical science. During my tenure in undergrad I had to take one computing course in either FORTRAN or Java. Like few other insane people, I chose FORTRAN. As it turned out, I was pretty good at it. Writing code made sense to me, and I found myself getting good grades on all my assignments.

A few years later I took a summer class mostly based in Python. I had no experience with Python, and since it was an online summer class I had to do all my work online with no instruction. To learn Python I was pointed to the Python docs and some Python tutorials. Most of what I read was gibberish at the time and I struggled through that course.

Once I got my internship Junior year, I was constantly finding problems that I tried to write Python to solve. I started learning it better and better since there were specific problems I had to solve and 1000 ways in Python to do so. Fast forward almost 4 years, and I've become a decent Python programmer, especially in a scientific context using NumPy and SciPy.

In my quest to get a Computer Science degree recently, I've been learning Java for the first time. Nothing super elegant about Java in my experience so far, but I see why so many people like it. There's a library for almost anything you could ever need to do, and it's so standardized that once you know the structure the code becomes easier (though often tedious) to write.

Fast forward to last night. I have a full project due in my current Java class at 9:00PM and I vastly underestimated the time I would need to complete it. I didn't leave myself enough time this week to get it done, so I'm incurring a late penalty. 

Last night after my third cup of coffee, one hour past the deadline already, I found myself with a mysterious logic bug causing my project to work funny. I started using the Eclipse debugger, setting breakpoints, and searching every method call, variable declaration etc. to find the damn thing. An hour later, I'm frustrated. I'm now two hours past the deadline, losing points with every second and I can't figure out what the hell is wrong.

I eventually narrow it down to one step in particular that never occurred to me because it required so little code that there was no way I could have made a mistake writing it.

By the time I was ready to give up and go to bed to enjoy dreams of a giant timer counting down until my project is worth 0 points, I found it. The little shit. This has always been my complaint about languages like Java. In a compound conditional statement, I had forgotten one super crucial bit of punctuation that caused my whole program to act funny. As it turned out, I forgot the ! operator, causing the whole condition to evaluate to true when it shouldn't have. Every bit of code after that moment still worked, but the program was screwed up for the rest of the runtime. One ! made all the difference.

And that's why I like Python better.

TL;DR: Forgot a ! in a compound conditional statement that caused funny behavior at runtime. Couldn't hunt it down for an hour. Programming are hard sometimes.

EDIT: Wow! Some heated comments on here. This was just a story about my experience with this one project. I don't hate Java, and clearly if I had started with Java, it would probably come more naturally to me than Python. It's all about perspective, and I was mostly venting to a community of people that would get what I was saying. I suppose /r/programming may have been better, but they don't allow text posts!

I'm sure I'll learn to love Java instead of just not-hate it. Python has it's disadvantages too. At least because of the nature of Java, this was a relatively quick fix. Who knows, it could have been way harder in Python with all that dynamic typing and what not!

P.S.: I'm not blaming Java for my stupidity. I made mistakes and that's that. And yes, I do need to write better tests! My classes in Java are the reason I learned to write tests, and because of that my Python code is getting better.

Thanks for reading, even though you didn't like it! "
57neco,1,2016-10-15,F4A - The Dark Journey To Fame,Undisclosed_Desires7,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/57neco/f4a_the_dark_journey_to_fame/,"Katheyn or what she preferred to be called Katy was the new intern at the company. A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused.

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

----------------

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (some possibly spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

The prompt above doesn't have to be the start or involved in it... just an example of some writing.

Can be different and have a male celebrity and their journey. (Check out my 'Famous Life' posting in my post history for that)

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Megan Fox, Margot Robbie, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba. Though.. the female celebrity can be an original character that is made up would love her to look like Madison Ivy or Lana Rhoades though also into Lindsey Pelas, Emily Sears and Claudia Alende.

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

P.S Also have a recent posting in which I mention all the rp's and things I'm interested in for a long term rp, so check that out if you want, particularly interested in doing a Marvel Black Widow RP or a Post apocalyptic/dystopia world that is similar to Fallout or a Bioshock rp. Also a Walking Dead rp.

Will I have any problem finding a place to internship at strictly because of my physical appearance? How is the engineering field when it comes to tattoos or overall appearance? "

The house is 2 blocks up Neil Ave within a five minute walk from campus. The house has hardwood flooring, stainless steel appliances, and ample parking in the back. There are 4 other STEM majors in the house, but you would have your own room. Rent would be around $500 a month plus utilities. I am willing to negotiate on the rent if necessary. If interested, I can send pictures and we can work out the details."

Studio/Music Production

Tech/Computer Science Field

Science/Laboratory work

Business?

I have no idea where to start or what to look for. I don't have very many connections, so I'm not sure where I should get started. I'm willing to do work for free if it's under my field of interests. I'm thinking of doing volunteer work under Lutheran Hospital, but I'm not sure if I'd get some work in those fields. I'm a big fan of all three areas, but I'd prefer some sort of involvement for tech, but I'm open to pretty much anything because I have no idea what opportunities are available to a high school student. I'm not really interested in fast food jobs, but I'm willing to do grunt work jobs even for free if I'm able to be around people in those fields a good amount of time. I'm already planning on getting some sort of computer science related internship senior year, and probably something during the summer. It isn't that much of a priority for me, but it is my biggest interest. My ideal field would be in a studio/music production. 

My strengths are mostly just math, huge interest in science, tech/computers. I don't mind spending time self-teaching if it's required too, but the likelihood is that I'll have busy work, but I'll do anything to be around experienced/talented people.

Thanks."

Here's my backstory: Recent CS grad, focused on software, picked up paid internship at a government office doing mostly help desk and learning system administration. I've found that I'm really interested in servers and sysadmin now, want to go completely away from the software side of things for now. I can't experiment on US government computers, so I'd like to put together my own server.

Requirements: Fairly low power usage, not too noisy, reasonably cheap ($1000 maybe?), used parts are okay. Must run Windows Server (it's what I work with).

I have my desktop PC that I use for various things, I have an old Dell with a E6700 that runs Blue Iris security software and runs my Plex server. Now that I'm up to 6 cameras, it runs like crap, almost always at 90% CPU usage. Have a couple laptops in the house, various tablets, etc. Would like to setup my kids (still very young, 6 and 4) with ""slave"" computers so they can learn various things too.

Mostly I want to learn about different concepts such as virtualization, remote management, user management, and basic study use for certifications like MCSE and other similar ones.

I've tried asking the guys I work with, but they have no interest in running a home server, so are of little help.

I would really appreciate just a little guidance on where to look to get started with all this.

Thanks!

 - Bettye testified that she could have written this letter to supplement Adnan's previously submitted application to College Park (this despite the application requiring a guidance counselor letter.) 

 - [Deadline to Apply for College Park Scholars was December 1](http://www.umd.edu/catalog/9900/chapter1.pdf). 

 - This is the program Adnan learned he was accepted into, before he was arrested. 

 - Students accepted to College Park were notified starting February 1. 

 - Adnan would later say this letter is the reason why he was late to last period class on the 13th. Otherwise, the question is, ""What were you doing up until the time that Jay dropped you off 40 minutes late for your last class?"" And, ""Why did you even go to class 40 minutes late -- if not just to get that ride that ride from Hae?""

* [EMAILID 12063] (https://www.wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/12063) List of media personalities who went to the ""off the record"" private party in the personal home of John Podesta. Includes many corrupt, in the tank-for-Hillary journalists like John Heillman, Mark Halperin, Maggie Haberman (colluding in other emails with the Hillary campaign) and many others. Largest amount of invitees who said yes to the private party are from the NYT, Bloomberg, MSNBC, CNN . Seems to nicely reflect the level of corruption and pro-Hillary bias. This is April 2015 so they were influencing and corrupting journalists for a long time and their investment clearly paid off. https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/12063

Or that younger women must support Hillary for the sole reason that she is a woman?  Team Clinton has no idea the danger they are causing of creating such an intense antipathy towards Hillary that many Bernie supporters and younger women will not vote for her in November. I had coffee today with a female college senior who is an intern with the Obama administration---the daughter of a Democrat who has worked for senior Democrats who asked me to look after her while she is in Washington, who told me ""I just hate her so much I might even vote for a Republican but I will never vote for her.""

2008-10-29  Ben Rhodes is denied interim security clearance. Must be something super shady because everyone else got the same clearance without any issue.

&gt; ""The FBI has indicated that they are inclined to decline interim security &gt; clearance for Benjamin Rhodes who is OFA senior speechwriter and national &gt; security policy person. They have not shared an explanation as to why.""

&gt;We can communicate with Susan and Sarah generally that Benjamin wasn't given interim status, and either Chris or I can communicate directly with Benjamin. For your information, out of the approximately 187 people who we have moved through the process Benjamin was the only person declined interim status.

Whatever this issue was they seemed to have covered it up and gave him clearance anyway, because he served in the Obama admin after all. But the fact that he was the ONLY person flagged out of 187 people seems extremely significant.

My end goal after uni was always to go into finance/insurance, and I have always been better at stats than any other maths modules so I think being an actuary is an ideal job for me.

I am just concerned 'I am not good' enough, I have limited experience in VBA/Excel but I know C, Pascal and have some experience in Haskell. I had a small part time job for a few weeks working at a local gym over the summer. 

Just wondering if anyone could give me some advice on the application process, what I should be doing this year (work experience, exams???, programming) to get a head start for graduate recruitment next year.

I currently attend a small university, I am in my junior year getting a BS in Computing and Information sciences: Information systems. My school offers a program where I can get a MS in Information Systems or Software engineering in one extra year, I'd have to apply this year. I am on track to graduate on time and I have less then 10,000 in federal loan debt. My concerns are that a Masters in either field wouldn't be profitable or useful because I wouldn't have any experience working in the field except for an internship at the time I graduate. Also the cost of an extra year could be 25,000 plus the opportunity cost of missing a year of work ~50,000, for a total of ~75,000. I have tried to look for salary data but its tough to apply it to my specific situation. I have also considered getting an MBA later on in my career. 

Let me know your thought or opinions. Thanks."

**I'm a Mormon**: Most is user created.     
**Static Pages**: There are a lot, but once you have a page set up, maintenance is easy and minimal    
**Videos**: Mormon.org videos are separate from Mormon Messages. And I'm not sure if their YouTube videos are included in the cost of the website. An interesting tidbit is that the last video was uploaded 5 months ago.     
**Photography**: Most of their photos look like stock photos. I doubt they spend much on photography seeing as most of it is used for all their websites/manuals/etc..

Other information: Most employees are part time and entry level. I know from professors and other students at BYUI that people at the church don't make a lot, and most employees are contract workers. It's hard to get fulltime hours, and it's even harder to get benefits. Plus, they pay tithing so there's that as well…

I'm not a math person, so it's hard for me to crunch the numbers, but as someone who knows about the cost of creating content, the website seems way over priced.    
    
When you think about the fact that the salaries I listed are for ALL church owned products, it's actually really sad. Honestly, I can't imagine enough people working at Mormon.org to justify the amount they're paying.    
    
You also have to keep in mind how much of the content is done voluntarily. There are entire service missions dedicated to maintaining the church websites and creating content.

57stci,5,2016-10-16,What Thinkpad for Mechatronics student?,thetom114,thinkpad,https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/57stci/what_thinkpad_for_mechatronics_student/,"Hi guys,

I've been looking to replace my 5 year old ASUS laptop and I have my eyes on the Thinkpad line. Almost all consumer laptops look like they would not last. I have used Thinkpads in the past at internships and I really liked its sturdiness. 
So now I'm looking for a sturdy and portable laptop for studying and for use at home (this will be my main pc) that will last a while. For my study it needs to be able to run Solidworks, I also use Solidworks outside of school so I think I will need a dedicated GPU.

.

I had a few other requirements:

*i5 or better

*8gb Ram

*14-15.6"" full HD screen

*Dedicated GPU

*Good build quality

*Good battery life

.

I had almost decided on the T460 or Thinkpad 13 until I decided I did want a dGPU for Solidworks and maybe some small games. Now I can't find a T460(s) with a dGPU so I guess whats left is a T460p or a T560. Or are there any other models I should be interested in?

I guess my question comes down to this: what would you guys do? Would a Thinkpad even be right for me? Or is it overkill and should I just go for a cheaper model?"

I have been put into a serious bind and I don't know how to get out of the situation I am in, my education is on the line at this point.

I am double majoring and I am in my last 2 years of of studies.
I have never taken a big loan out and I I have been able to remain debt free up till how.
Next year, I will need about $37,000 to complete my education and I am in need of loans. I have applied to FAFSA and I know how i much I will have for this year and next.

I have about $7500 saved up which I will use solely for my education; however, even after FAFSA I will need about $20,000 in loans from banks. However, I don't know if I need a cosigner or not.
-I have had a card for 4 years and I have consistently used it
-paid it off the next month, always paid more than minimum, and ensured that I would not have any outstanding debt.
-I have made about $8000 from internships and never had a loan (so debt vs income ratio should be good)
-credit score is for sure over 700.

I have talked to the financial adviser at my university and she has stated that I should talk to the bank first before taking fafsa. If I take fafsa first, then I will have to show that I accruing debt on my social and hurt my chances of getting loan from the banks.

This year I got $7,500 from the FAFSA...next year I will get $13,500 ($7.5k Unsubsidized, $5.5K subsidized) 

Am I a strong candidate for a loan without a cosigner?  (I DONT HAVE A COSIGNER)
I really dont want to have to drop out being so close toward the end of my education."

It's long, but very juicy, I work for a company where I can hire independent contractors for projects that I create and I alone manage them.

I met (let's call him Dan) at a gay strip club that my friend bartends at. Dan is 23 in college (last year) studying Business with a concentration in Health and Wellness and product promotions. Models here and there. He VERY attractive, muscular, completely my type (physically)...still getting to know him, very very nice guy so far. We have some lap dances, and chat, he tells me about college, I tell him about my job (I'm 29 btw) and okay I'll tell the truth, I give him $50 and at close we jo together in my car (don't judge me! lol) we exchanged numbers etc. 

Three weeks later (we didn't tex much since, just hello's and some pictures) I'm at the club and we're chatting, he asks if my company has an internship, he takes classes online and sometimes goes into the campus and is looking for something during the week to make sure that money/ intern. I tell him we're a small company and we don't, but I can hire him as a contractor and teach him the industry, he actually lives in an area where I need to do some marketing anyway and it's hard for me to get to, so far it's a win-win. 

So I don't really know how this happened but basically since I can give him some extra hours of pay here and there and he can add us to his resume/ internship, and I'm going to introduce him to people in the industry... We both start to have this understanding that basically we're going to hook up (keeping it a secret) along the way and enjoy each other. 

*I won't be paying him out of pocket for hooking up at all and he understands that, a lot of the projects I do I can hire people for, but honestly it's hard to find good reliable people, so I just do them myself, so our budget remains pretty big, so I can give him extra money on his check*

I told him that he's not going to make a ton of money with this internship but it's a great learning experience and he told me, it's cool. And that he won't be into everything (anal lol) right away but eventually we can get there (I'm a top, mostly lol). 

My friends said this is hot, but maybe I should be weary, and make sure I'm the one pulling the strings. .. 

*Some insight* My headquarters is across the country and I work alone remotely. So pretty much no one will know, etc.*

 My friend also said to be cautious he may try to request a lot of money and also make sure he doesn't try to contact any of my higher-ups to try to take my job or anything (impossible lol) Pretty much they're saying be careful because he is a stripper and perhaps a hustler. 

I already drew some lines, which are standard with independent contractors, in their POC, they contact me only within the company. I already let a female contractor go when she reached out to my director and caused some drama (long story). 

Also, he's a personal trainer and will help me get ripped (I'm already in-shape but, hey why not show him off at the gym lol) pretty much he's my ""Boy toy"" and I told him this and he laughed and said ""yeah sounds good."" guessing he's ""straight"" I'm wise enough to know that I can't date him and this will purely be a mix of business and pleasure, but if something develops ya never know.

I am curious to why he reached out to me about this opportunity when at the strip club there are a lot of older guys with a lot more money... Not sure but not complaining! 

I'd like to get your opinions about this!"
57tj2n,1,2016-10-16,Long Distance Relationship Help,ThrowProblemAway1,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/57tj2n/long_distance_relationship_help/,"To avoid gender bias in this discussion, I will not be revealing who is who here. We are both in our mid twenties though.

For some background on us, we have been dating for almost 7 years now. For the entire time, minus the first year where my SO lived less than 5 minutes from me, we have lived at least an hour apart from each other. The last two years have had us living in different states altogether. I am finishing up school in central Arkansas and my SO had their first internship for a year in southern Alabama and is now in southern Missouri since June. Naturally, this limits our availability to see each other, especially when neither of us have the money for flights, excessive time off to see each other, etc. Nonetheless, whenever I could go see my family in western Tennessee (2.5hr drive), I would go out of my way to split my time between my family and seeing my SO in Alabama (3.5hr drive from my home in TN) while they were there. The problems came recently when my SO had their last 2 trips down from Missouri (3.5hr drive) to see their family and failed to come see me twice in a row.

The first trip was for leisure with their family. They had a 3 day weekend and came down to see their family (sidenote: my SO has to pass my town to get back to their town which is almost an hour away). They had tried to come stay the night with me that Thursday night via leaving immediately after work (hitting the road at 6 basically) but they were too tired. I understood, I had driven on no sleep to see them before and couldn't bare the thought of them doing the same for me, far too dangerous on those mountain roads. So, they said they would try to see me Sunday when they left home. Come Sunday when my SO was headed back home, I had woken up around 2pm (I work weekends night shifts) and asked them where they were. They told me about 2 hours north of where I was (so past me already), I asked why they didn't come to see me and they said that they didn't have time due to having to be back home in Missouri to work on projects/presentations for their internship. I understood the urgency on getting back, I know the pressure they're under, but I asked why not just stop for a few minutes to say hi and let me hold them for a few minutes. They said they wanted to but they knew it wouldn't just be a few minutes and, to be fair, I did too, it would probably last for an hour or so. This would leave them getting back fairly late and having little time to work on their internship stuff. So, I conceded the point and moved on but expressed my discontent with them not seeing me. My SO said they felt bad about it but had to get back. Everything was ok.

Then, the next trip came this past weekend, almost a month since their last trip down. This time, they were picking up a new vehicle from their parents due to the elderly state of the SO's current car. In addition, my SO went hunting with their dad as they haven't in a while and season had started recently. They came down Saturday morning and left Sunday morning. The same thing happened, I woke up at 2pm (again, night shift) and called. They were just over an hour past me this time, but said the same thing, that they had to get back and do work on projects, etc for their internship. I made it clear that I wasn't happy and they got irritated and said (paraphrasing) ""let me guess, you hate me for not seeing you?"" They hung up after that. I messaged them saying I didn't hate them.

My issue here is that when the positions were reversed and my SO was in Alabama, I went out of my way to see them and split my time with my family, several days with them and several days with my SO. I did this multiple times. But, when it comes to reciprocating, I'm feeling ignored. I understand that they had only 2 days down here this last time, but still, just a few minutes is all I wanted.

I do understand that I may be at fault here though for several reasons. The second time, I didn't ask if they could come see me, but one could argue that it should be a given. Additionally, after the first incident, conceding the point of not being able to be together for JUST a few minutes could have given them a false signal that it was ok to not see me this time for the same reasons.

We love each other very much and have dealt with the long distance very well (especially compared to many many others I've known) throughout the years. I don't want to lose them over something like this, but am I in the wrong here? Or are they for failing to reciprocate the time given when I was the one to travel?"

I am pretty behind in the class, and want to drop it, so I can free up my schedule and actually concentrate on it in my last semester.

At the UofC, first year engineers only have one programming related course, (afaik).

In the second year, there are 3 (edit: 5) software engineering/programming related courses.

In comparison, Computer Science students take roughly 3 (edit: 2) and 6 computer science courses in their first and second years, respectively.

As a result, will I be at a disadvantage regarding internships during those first two years? I understand that for many internships knowledge of data structures and algorithms are paramount (not really 1st year material), but there are [internships I've seen at companies like Google](https://www.google.com/about/careers/jobs#!t=jo&amp;jid=/google/engineering-practicum-intern-summer-2017-1600-amphitheatre-pkwy-mountain-view-ca-1369310059&amp;) geared toward first/second year students. Will Comp Sci students at this point in time have learned significantly more material that'll aid them in getting internships?"
57vb03,1,2016-10-16,"My [21F] ex-boyfriend [22M] is acting super clingy but not being mean, so I feel like a jerk for being so bothered by him.",throwawaycanadagirlx,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/57vb03/my_21f_exboyfriend_22m_is_acting_super_clingy_but/,"So, for the sake of this story we'll call my ex Mike.

 Mike and I were dating for about 7 months, but I broke up with him when I moved downtown for school. Even though it's not super far (about an hour and fifteen min commute by public transit), I was busy with school, an internship, and a job - I figured the best idea would be to just breakup with him because I just didn't have the kind of time I'd like to invest in a relationship. He was pretty against the breakup, telling me that he was fine seeing me three times a month (ignoring that I told him I don't want to be in a relationship I can't give more time to), and that we could make it work if we wanted it badly enough. He eventually got the memo that even though he was okay with that kind of arrangement, I wasn't. To be honest, I don't really feel I need a reason to justify my breakup, but needless to say, he definitely didn't see why it was necessary. 

Now, I think I fucked up by saying we could still keep in contact as friends. He texts me all the time. I feel kinda bad because he's never being mean, it's always just him talking about his day. It sounds like I was close to him and he enjoyed having someone to talk to about mundane things. But, since we've broken up, I just don't really want to be staring at my phone texting him all day when my schedule is jammed with work. It's always such one sided conversations where he'll ask me really SIMPLE, small-talk questions over and over. He's asked me multiple times why our conversations have gotten shorter, and I remind him each time that it's the same reason I broke up with him: **I'm busy.**

A couple times he's been downtown for various reasons and we'll hang out for a couple hours. He asks to kiss me at the end of every time we see each other, and seems kind of disappointed when I say no. He never pushes my boundaries or pressures me, but seems obviously sad about it. Last week he came to hang out and was **driving. me. crazy.** with his attempts at PDA. He always had to sit pressed right up against me, tried to put his hand on my knee, etc. Eventually he left and nothing happened, but I was kind of annoyed. 

Today I was going up town to visit some family and told him we could grab a coffee or something since I'm in the area. Long story short it didn't end up happening because of a personal emergency that ended with me in the hospital. I told him I wasn't coming and he ended up bombarding me with questions, called me incessantly (I wasn't answering because I was literally talking to the doctor), wanted to know what hospital I was at so he could come over, etc. I told him that there were people with me and I didn't want him to come, and he responded with ""ok, i hope you're okay, I'm super worried about you xoxoxoxo i'll call you tonight babe"". 

I know this makes me sound like a huge loser because he was trying to be nice, but honestly, at this point I'm just over it. I don't really want to talk to him at all. The problem is, I don't know how to communicate it to him because he hasn't done anything *wrong*, per se, I just feel like I broke up with him because I thought it would be wrong to string him along, and now he keeps acting like he's my boyfriend even though I've established countless times he isn't. Am I just being a jerk? What the fuck do I say to someone who clearly doesn't get the memo that we're on two different wavelengths of expectations? I really don't feel like telling him to fuck off is warranted because I feel like he has good intentions. 

  **tl;dr**: My ex-boyfriend is still in full boyfriend mode even though we broke up and it's driving me up the wall."

I'm a chemical engineering sophomore and I have a few questions regarding practical opportunities and about the future of the field. There is a lot I don't know, especially about the kinds of general and specific businesses that utilize chemical engineers. I want to get a better understanding of the capabilities of my major.

What are good methods to finding internships? I went to my local career fair this week and there were only 4 companies considering Chem E's, two of which were software firms. Outside of that, what is a good way to find local companies that hire engineers? I preferably would like to find a smaller to midsize companies because I want to get a good mix of things. Also, what are recommended companies to always apply for? 

I see a lot of people recommend CoOps, but in my university I have never heard of that. How can I find out if a certain company offers one?

Lastly, I am highly interested in nano-technology (I am currently an undergraduate researcher in a nano-materials lab.), but I am aware about how much it is a developing area. Are there currently companies that do have nano products? Is there a difference between a R&amp;D project in a company versus at a university? Is it worth while to find a nano-related internship and how can I find one?

I really lack awareness of who and what is out there for me, so appreciate any feedback!

My interests include video games (particularly WoW which I can play without the $15 monthly fee due to a feature added a year ago that allows me to pay the fee with ingame currency) and anime. I also have mild Aspergers Syndrome and some symptoms of ADD and I've suffered plenty of depression.

I've been in and out of college several times now because I just didn't have it all together mentally, I didn't know what I really wanted toe do with my life and I didn't have much of a social or support network. However after the last college I dropped out of, I did manage to secure an extended internship doing IT work for a year and I think that's what I intend on doing the next time I try college if I go back (which I think is best all things considered).

The problem is, I haven't been able to find a job after the internship ended a year ago. I guess some could say I haven't tried everything, but I've spent a good amount of time trying to find jobs, I usually use online applications since that's what most places look at, but I've been to several job fairs as well. But I still have yet to find a job, even stuff like retail or grocery jobs (which I used to work in a few years ago) have turned down my applications. I'm hopeful if I keep trying something is bound to show up eventually, maybe with the holidays coming around the corner I'll have better luck, but I can't say for sure right now.

Then there's my social life. I've always had social anxiety making it difficult for me to get out there and make friends, but now with the lack of money or a vehicle (used to drive a family vehicle but the engine had an issue that ended up costing more to fix than the vehicle was worth so my parents sold that and haven't started looking for a new one) it's even more difficult. I had a friend that used to hang out with me more but he's been working several jobs and always says he's busy whenever I ask him what he's up to, part of me wonders if he's just saying that because he's fed up with me not having income and is only trying to be nice, but who knows if my suspicions are correct.

I'm single of course. I would really like a relationship, I go on dating sites and such but the most I ever get out of those are 1-2 message conversations before people think I'm not that attractive. Besides, I don't really even have a plan on how to support a relationship without a job, it's not fair to expect others to support one on my behalf, but still I can't help but desire for that. I used to be in love with a girl years ago and ever since we broke up it's felt like there's been a void in me that I've been trying to fill.

All this said, it seems pretty evident that the first step to getting myself out of this rut is getting a job which I'm continuing to look for. But the reason why I'm posting this is to address the social life issues and ask questions. What sort of things can I try to help with my loneliness issues? Are there ways I can make attempts at dating without the money issue? And lastly, is there anyone here who would be willing to be friends even if it's just online only?

Thanks all"

This weekend ended in emotional pain, me dropping my phone into a toilet on accident and it sitting in a bag of rice, me finding out my car is having engine problems, and realizing my back tires have minimal tread on them. Along with standard school performance and financial stress.

I met a guy before this summer happened – we will call him Casey. Shorter than me, blond, smart, super down to earth. I was able to tease him and he could tease me, it seemed pretty perfect. Then this shite weekend happened. Here's basically the entire story of how it came to be, I'll try to answer any questions asked below.

The night we met was awesome; one of my friends (we will call him Rowe) brought over Casey before the party even picked up, so we chatted a little bit. We played kings cup while everyone slowly trickled in, and the only thing I remember thinking was “darn, would be awesome if this guy was gay”. It was the first time I was really interested in someone since my ex had torn my heart out a year ago. King’s cup ends, I went off, drank, and do my own thing with friends. A few hours and a decent amount of beer later, I end up on the dance floor dancing with a group of people including Casey. I started getting a vibe from Casey but didn’t know if he was just being friendly. Shortly after, I left and walked up to my friend Rowe and say “yo, by any chance is Casey NOT straight?”. He shrugged and laughed. About an hour later I work up the courage to ask this guy out, I didn’t know if I would ever get the chance to see him again, so I went for it. I walked up to him, tapped him on the shoulder, and said “by any chance, do you date dudes?”, to which he responded with “depends on which day of the week”. My mind was blown and I just staggered off after giving him a smile, nodding my head, and saying ‘alright!’.

Night ended pretty well. I had to help kick people out, so I told him to stay close to me so I could make sure he stayed. After the party it was raining, I gave him one of my hoodies and we went and got food for about an hour discussing the party, what he meant by ‘depends on which day’, etc. Went back to the house, sat and talked for another two or three hours, exchanged numbers, then I sent him off to the extra bed in Rowe’s room where he originally planned on sleeping. The next morning the buses weren’t running, so I drove him home and we stopped for coffee on the way for another hour or two date thing.

He was always super busy with his studies, but I got to have another coffee date with him and we discussed relationship stuffs. After a couple weeks of texting, playing video games, and skyping, I get him over for another weekend to hang out, drink, and watch movies/youtube. At this point we had already discussed our views on sex and there was no pressure on either of us for that. We end up kissing, falling asleep next to each other on a bed, then cuddled the night away. That was the last night I was going to be able to see him before the summer began since he had an internship lined up. Dropping him off, we discussed if a LDR would be plausible since he would be leaving; he expressed his insecurities with the idea of that, so I left it alone for the most part and decided to wait until the school year began to talk about it again. 

About three weeks into summer we both happened to be drunk and decided to skype while I played league and he played Overwatch. The only thing was that he could not say anything out loud since his dad didn’t know he was pansexual, so it was basically just us being drunk and him being able to hear me, and he typed his responses. That was the only time we really were able to talk over summer since he was working 50-60 hour work weeks and he was stressed all of the time. I didn’t want to put the pressure or obligation on him to stay in contact with me since I knew what his summer entailed. 

Once school started back up, we were both completely booked all of the time. We managed to put an hour coffee break with each other for two or three weeks just to be able to spend time with each other. Eventually he was able to come over this Friday night! We had no clue what we would do, so I just bought an array of drinks (beer and two types of wine) I knew he liked for him to choose from. Night starts off kinda odd, he seems tense. I let him relax and I just play random shows on the TV and sit at my desk until he winds down, I figured it was school related. He eventually unwinds and we have a blast just hanging out and showing each other shitty TV shows and videos; night ended in cuddles as to be expected. One thing he said that threw me off though was that he didn’t want to be vulnerable when he peeled away for a moment; we talked about it and eventually he relaxed again and fell asleep.

The next morning, he was really quiet and I could tell something was up, but I didn’t want to poke at it in front of my roommate.  On the drive back to his place, we stopped for coffee and parked outside his house to talk about it. Long story short is that he doesn’t feel like he belongs in a relationship for the next 5+ years until he finishes school, one because of how little time he has and he feels it would stress him out too much, and the other reason is because he feels he would be too anxious and worried about it all of the time. The three phrases he said that keep repeating in my head are “This sounds cliché, but it’s not you, it’s me.”, “You’re too great of a guy, you deserve way better than me.”, and “You could get way better, way quicker than trying to be with me.”. The whole discussion took about an hour to unravel, and I was fine up until the end. For some reason it all hit me at once and I just couldn’t speak anymore, so we sat in silence for about 10 minutes while my eyes swelled up. He patted me on the shoulder and said “I’m sorry” and then I couldn’t contain myself anymore and began to slowly cry. After about 5 more minutes he decided to leave my car and told me to drive safe, and the only thing I could respond with was a nod.

This weekend was complete hell and I have been sleeping like crazy for the bulk of it just out of sheer being sad and running off of very minimal sleep. I don’t really know what I wish to accomplish with typing this all out and sharing it, maybe get it off my chest and get some random input. I’m not looking for answers to any specific questions, just open to any response really.

Over the summer I volunteered at a local museum with a teen internship program and today I decided to see if there was anyone I remembered working for the fall. But of course I get there and realize that I have no social skills so I am unable to even look up from my feet and say hi. I wait by the door awkwardly waiting for them to come out and hope that one of them walks up to me. When this doesn't happen I walk home crying like s bitch.  


I'm fucking sick of it. I don't want to go back to school and be surrounded by people with something I once had. I don't want to do the same thing every fucking day without saying so much as a word to anyone outside my family., without anything of interest happening.  I'm sick of my mom telling be to practice being social. How do I do that when I don't have anyone to talk to? I hate sitting in the same chair in the same corner of everyday  spending my lunches alone.  I'm 3/4 of the way through highschool and I've yet to have anything really memorable happen.  "

""My first day at work....I have arrived"", says the young man, feeling like Elon Musk. As he strides arrogantly through the front door of The Facility, he walks by two jet black obelisks, that begin to vibrate violently. At that moment, an alarm sounds, and before Dave can react he is struck from the back and falls to the ground. Barely conscious he hears voices: 
""How did he get in here and who is he?""
""I don't know sir, he just walked through the doors. Somehow he bypassed Clynne Corporation Security Robotrons."" 
""How could this be? Send a message to the CEOs Dr. Prospero, and Zero."" ""I don't care about the specifics, kill him."" 
""But sir, aren't we supposed to wait for the Department Head Goda to arrive?""
""He would have killed him anyway.""
Dave hears the sound of a pistol being pulled from a holster, and at that moment, filled with the adrenaline of youth, like a young buck about to mate, jumps to his feet and pulls out his I.D. tag screaming, ""I AM AN INTERN HERE. PLEASE DON'T KILL ME!"". 
Both security guards are surprised for a moment. But then their surprise turns to pure rage. ""Even worse,"" says one of the guards preparing to shoot Dave. But at that moment, as Dave prepares to experience the pain and freedom of death, as he sees his life flash before him, a cool, relaxed, British, voice says, ""Stop.""

Dave opens his eyes to see a handsome man. So handsome, that Dave begins to question his sexuality. Maybe he should leave his wife, he thought. However he tables the thought to focus on the events at hand. 
""Sir! I-I-I-I-I-I""
""Don't waste your time trying to explain.""
At that moment a pulse laser sounds, and the security guard is erased from existence. The handsome man raises his hands, and a heavily armored soldier phases in from nothingness next to him.
""Sir"", the soldier says.
""I want his entire family dead by the end of today."", the handsome man replies.
""As you wish,"" and the soldier phases back into nothingness. The handsome man looks at the other security guard. ""Jeffery, was it?""
""Yes sir! Department Head Goda Sir!""
The handsome man, who Dave now knows is Goda, gives a warm smile and laughs. The security guard becomes relaxed. 
""It was good you did not follow that idiot"", Goda says, motioning to the black spot where the previous security guard had existed. ""For that, it looks like you will be receiving a promotion to platoon leader. Who would have thought, considering it is your first day on the job"", says Goda.
""Thank you sir,"" the security guard says. ""Now go to HQ and prepare for briefing on your new position"", Goda says looking at the man. ""Sir."" , replies the security guard running of in a direction. 

""Sorry about that Dave"", Goda says walking towards Dave. ""Uh...I-I-I-I-I-I. How do you-"".
""How do I know who you are?""  says Goda. Dave completely stunned that his mind was read, and in trance due to the luxurious perfume emanating from Goda (which once again causes him to question his sexuality), says nothing. ""I know you have somewhere to get to, so I will make things short, My name is Goda Dolce, and I am the head of the Department of Public Security at this facility, come by when you are free to visit me"", Goda says handing Dave an animated card showing the Logo of the department on it. ""Don't worry about getting lost, we are in the Square of Lychee. Just look for a giant world tree, with huge apples.""
""Ok"" replies Dave.
""Also, make sure to be weary of the Department of Theoretical Human Interaction. Their department head, Dr. Hans Siegfried will make use of any chance to use you for his.......experiments. Also in room 315 in hallway 3B of sector 27, which is to the left of the ikea cube is the Department of Theoretical Theory Theorisation. They are currently at war, to say the least, with the Department of Actualising Actionable Actions, led by Department head Dr. TryActing. Don't get yourself involved in the feud, and don't ask why.""
""Why not"", says Dave testosterone beginning to fill his veins.
""Do you want to die?"" Goda replies silencing Dave.
""Well good luck, young buck, and  welcome to The Facility"", and just as Dave looks up Goda is gone.
""What have I gotten myself into?"", Dave thinks to himself.

""I don't know Dave, I really don't know"".  But before Dave can even react or say a word, everything goes black."
57w5q1,3,2016-10-17,[Clone Training: Wave Battle] Announcement: Terzo is offering $30/wave customized sparring matches with any number of his clones you want.,MIA_of_SS,SecretSubreddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/SecretSubreddit/comments/57w5q1/clone_training_wave_battle_announcement_terzo_is/,"#Intro

Oi, Terzo here. As you all know, I can create infinite clones. Those of you interested in brushing up your combat skills, I can let you fight a bunch of my clones. We're disposable, so you can totally shred their asses. It's $30/wave, but I accept interns and/or really fancy or unique weaponry as alternative payment. If you can't afford it, talk to me and we can work something out.

You can completely customize the fight to your needs. For your reference, here are my skills. These are obviously also the skills of my clones.



#Clone Skill-levels

* Hand-to-hand: intermediate-level judo. I won't be winning any tournaments, but I could win in just about any street fight.

* Melee Weapons: basic swordsmanship and weapons training. I can swing and block, but I'm no expert.

* Gunmanship: my strongest area, but still not master-level. I can get a pretty tight spread with a .45. Because I can clone objects, I can clone a bullet just as one leaves the chamber, meaning I never have to reload.



#Important Notes

* If you want clones armed, you can arm them per wave. But every clone within a wave will have the same weapon.

* You can decide whether the Terzos are allowed to clone their weapons. For guns, that means firing continuously without reloading, and for melee that means practically-infinite throwing weapons. 

* You'll get rests between each wave, and a chance to heal up with a basic medkit nearby. 

* Though individually we are weak, our power comes in numbers. Use your best judgment in choosing how many to fight.

* We have a vast interconnected telepathic intelligence. So don't expect to sneak up on any of us, because if one clone can see you, they all can see you. 

* There's an optional final boss. You can't choose it or know what it is, but I will scale its difficulty based on your other choices.

# [OOC] About/Meta

This is a new pseudo-series I'm trying out. The idea is that Terzo's clones could help you train in various ways. I plan to have other formats too, most of which aren't even fighting. There are some silly ones. 

Anyway, I'm not big into serious RP fighting and I don't care for trying to kill off characters (even though they can always come back). In other words, your character is guaranteed a win, unless s/he's objectively in waaaaaay over his/her head. In that case, well, I donno, maybe just a KO or whatever. Unless you're okay with being killed off in a training round and revived later. Oh and if you want to roll dice, you can.

Don't expect me to entertain you if you ask for 100 waves or something. Ain't nobody got time for that. 

Lastly, I apologize in advance for taking a while to respond sometimes. While I will try to always reply, there may be delays since I'm always busy with classes and work. 

I will let this sit overnight and see how many responses I get. If it's a lot, I'll dedicate a whole post to each request on a first-come-first-serve basis."
57w8ks,4,2016-10-17,I feel like a failure most of the time and a burden,Frau_Aeron,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/57w8ks/i_feel_like_a_failure_most_of_the_time_and_a/,"The only time I felt content with a decision was during this year when I broke off my 8 year relationship to be with someone else who loves me and treats me well. I never realized how angry/sad I was in the long distance relationship, even now friends of mine bring it up and say that I look happier and just more at ease. It's not something that I am mad at my ex about, he didn't know how he wanted to be loved but he couldn't love me the way I needed either. What gets to me the most is the time I had spent with him, 8 years (I devoted a lot of time to that relationship)... I'm 26 now and just barely trying to get back to college and make the most of a part time job that I have, which in all honesty I don't even like.

I say I feel like a failure because so far the decisions I've started to make for myself are just not bearing any fruit whatsoever. My father constantly keeps reminding me that I'm ""not fooling anyone but myself"" because I don't have a degree. He also says that me living at the house makes him have more responsibilities and that he shouldn't be forced to take care of me. To be frank I only came back home because my mother cried to me over the phone about how my dad might be losing his job, so I stopped going to school about 2-3 years ago and got myself a part time job to help pay for the cellphone bill and some other things for my parents. I've been doing that ever since.

I don't have a place here in the house, I sleep on the couch. Heaven forbid I don't come home one night because I think to myself that sleeping at my boyfriend's house will give me a good night's worth of sleep for work the next day. They complain to me that I should respect the rules of their house, but they tell me to also be independent as well and do my own things. And asking me when I'm gonna pick up the slack and just find another job, the attitude they give me about that kind of stuff doesn't really help.

My family makes me feel like a failure and a burden, and it in turn makes me feel like trying to pursue my dream of art is really just me wasting my time. I'm not really qualified for much else, but I'm not exactly grade A artist material (I didn't go to art school so I lack the networking it gives). Still I try and I push myself, I apply for internships and keep on making my art.

But I still feel like a burden and a failure. I've never felt so lost before. I'm just tired of telling myself that things will be alright as I cry myself to sleep some nights.

Maybe I need to just move out with a friend, perhaps it's just the toxicity. I should've probably titled it that my parents make me feel like a failure, whoops.

Thanks for reading you guys."

How to choose the correct PLC to implement redundancy ?,qk_bulleit,PLC,https://www.reddit.com/r/PLC/comments/57wz18/help_with_plc_redundancy_setup_how_to_choose_the/,"I am an automation engineering student currently doing an internship . I need to help with choosing the PLC for the project I am going to have to do , I have never worked with a PLC before , but I have experience with various microcontrollers (C , C+ , C#) and control models in matlab simulink as well as other types of programming (Java , python , Basic ).

I know little About redundancy so I looked around for more information. Of all the available redundant possibilities this one seems to me to be the easiest : **Shadow Mode** 

&gt;Two identical PLCs run the same software and share the same inputs and outputs. One operates as the primary, the second as a backup. If a heartbeat signal from the first is not received by the second, the backup unit assumes control of the automation system providing uninterrupted operation. These require a bit more design and require an arbitration circuit for the sensors &amp; actuators to avoid conflict.

[link](http://www.icsenggroup.com/plc-redundancy.shtml)

I was wondering if r/PLC could help me decide if this is the best solution and how can I find a model which can operate this way. Any information about PLC redundancy would be welcome .

Thanks

I have been asked by my manager to provide suggestions to manage our office software, as our current licenses are expiring and no longer available.

Problem is, the licensing model of office 365 is giving me headaches, and it looks like to be fully compliant with the license terms we would have to pay for a ridiculous amount of substantially unused licenses, due to the ""by head"" licensing model used instead of the classic ""by machine"" one (even a limit on the concurrently active users would be a lot better then the current license model).

**Priorities:**

* Needed: Excel, Word, Publisher, PowerPoint

* Useful: BI suite (mostly power-pivot), Access

* Not needed: Exchange, Outlook, Onedrive, Skype

**Users:**

* 3 Users: (management) Desktop + laptop + mobile

* 8-10 users (office staff): Desktop

* 6 users (shift leaders): Sharing one desktop with separate accounts.

We want you guys to contribute by helping people who are currently preparing for the MCATS/SMLE/Boards, and also for those who are in need of help in just medical knowledge of any fields. I've been in every medical discords and I noticed they lacked refining what discords really need: organization and activeness in contributing what many of us need. I guess you can think of this as the student doctor forum but LIVE. People are separated into sections in pre-med, med students, interns, residents, and attendings of fields in radiology, cardio, surgery, etc. I also aim to bring people who are tech crazy like me to keep up with top medical trends in regards to medical technology : Iknife, robotics, prostetics, new findings, etc. The reason why discord may be the best choice compared to skype, ovoo, aim, and many other forms of communication is due to the limited amount of people/limited communication/discombobulated organization that those services offer. We can have as many people we want, we can organize you into many different categories, we can communicate verbally or through text easily without complications.

In discord, there are voice channels that people can enter for the sake of separate categories in medical school mock interviews, mcat help, SMLE help, medical findings, news, study breaks, study music (yes we have automatic bots that provides music that may help you study, you can also choose the songs!).

Obviously, there are strict rules in casting away those who are using foul language, trollers, non-interested individuals, and violation of potential HIPAA rules.

The Discord Server: https://discord.gg/CYCvEdN is for your learning needs, and so take advantage of it!

It's free. Also, I recommend getting the downloadable Discord App so it can open up every time you turn on your computer! There is also a discord app on your iphone/android phone (FREE!)

57xyau,1,2016-10-17,Personal loan from family to take out student loans?,breezy727,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/57xyau/personal_loan_from_family_to_take_out_student/,"Over the course of going to a private university for undergrad and taking out a loan to supplement an internship done during grad school (I was fully funded in my grad program and was paid out a stipend) I accrued around 30K in debt from four loans - one at 5.4% and the others at 6.8%. They're all government loans, none private, and I've been paying at least to cover interest each month since taking them out. 

Since getting my first real job a few months ago I've been trying to do a double payment monthly and expected to pay the smallest loan (around 6K) off in the next year. This morning I learned that my organization is shutting down next year though and while I'm fairly confident I can land on my feet and they're offering a generous retention bonus, I'm pulling back to making a regular payment and socking away what I planned on paying towards student loans to create a better buffer.

Before my job issues arose, my wonderful and generous parents offered to pay my student loans off through a personal loan with a much lower interest rate (probably around 2%). My questions are:

1) How much could they loan me to cover these loans so that I wouldn't take a tax hit? Would a personal loan like this qualify as a gift with that 10K yearly maximum? 

2) Is it possible for them to pay the loans directly and have me just pay them back or does that qualify as a gift too?

3) It's possible in the next year that I switch to a job offering up to a 5K yearly student loan repayment. I don't currently know the terms of this but assuming it's a matching program then by paying 15K in three years I could also pay down these loans. But there's no way this program would work with a private loan through my family. Is the potential benefit of a program like this worth gambling with repaying my loans right now by family and getting a lower interest rate?

4) Is there anything else with this scenario that I don't know about that we should be aware of?

Right now this is in the beginning stages of a conversation. My parents can more than afford making this as a gift, not a loan, but it is mutually agreed that this should be a loan and I don't foresee any stress on our relationship. These are just some initial questions but moving forward I know my parents would also meet with their financial adviser to hammer out more details. I just want to come to the table of our next discussion (probably over Thanksgiving) better informed. 

Thank you!

In January I hope to pass P.

I am in my 2nd year of university and I wish to apply for an internship for the summer after my 3rd year.

The problem is, my GPA is really low, due to multiple years of fuckups when I was in another faculty. It's sitting at just above 2.5.

So I was thinking, for me to have a competitive edge against other candidates for an intership, should I just pass more exams?

If one has.. say 4 exams, would companies be more willing to hire? Or would it be the opposite?

I hear people say too many exams can hurt when looking for an EL position. I was wondering if it's the same for internship positions.

Let me know what you guys think. Thanks"

Help me get out of it.,loldebtsucksamirite,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/57yi4g/im_about_13k_in_debt_help_me_get_out_of_it/,"Hey there, due to some abuse from family and bad anaphylaxis im left with the bill for thousands in debt. I freelance full time now and actively and looking for more ways to make money but with people calling and or emailing, I'm trying to figure out what to do.

22. College student that took a semester off. I've lost a job few a months ago and had to move 2 months ago due to bad living situation. No support from family despite helping them out. I don't have stability, but can do smaller payments until I'm more sure of what I can afford later.

Debts:
CC 1: 2,568 -- wants 70mo
CC 2: 580
Paypal: 480
Medical: 3,400
Old school debt: 1300 - wants almost 300 a mo :(
Verizon: 1469 - will work with me
Other phone: 780 (??)
Student loans: 25kish, and starting an income based repayment plan until I'm in school or in an internship. First payment will be 11/26/16.
old payday loan (I know): Intially 230, but having troubling getting a price now after interest and whatnot

I'm making between 300-600 a week before taxes freelancing, cook my meals, no car because it died but need one soon (just a cheapo beater), phone is 35+ a month through Project Fi, no reoccurring services like Netflix, but I am moving in with SO in a month and estimate that to be 400 a month for my total share. Food is about 200 a month, though often less because I eat a lot of Rice dishes.

I've been putting off health needs though, like my wisdom teeth are bad and I desperately need counseling. First company for the larger CC debt won't go down to less than 70/mo and I need to have money in savings in case something happens because a lot of things have happened lately. Verizon bill will work with me, but not everyone will enough for me to put a way a bit and actually do needed things.

How do I negotiate? With the Verizon one I straight up said I can't do more than 30-50max and they said they can call later when I have a better idea. CC #1 isn't as flexible, and did attempt to get a judgement though it was dismissed before the court date BUT they still want too much and I don't want it to get to court again.

So personal finance, help with a plan? It's been an awful few years and I've realized now that while I had good intentions, my family did take advantage of me and I need to do what's best for me, alone. 

Current goals: 
Cheap car (no public transport and not safe for bike)
Get my ass back in classes (but would need to pay that school debt)
Put away 200+/mo in savings
Get my online biz going

note: I spoke with several lawyers and finance people and everyone recommends bankruptcy since my health problems get expensive along with school.. Not ideal, but just throwing that there but I do not want that."

We started a LD relationship just over a year ago when she contacted me on OkCupid. She's from Mexico, and I live in Texas. She is very intelligent, cultured, educated, and pretty, and speaks English well. She is hard-working, family-oriented, passionate, and has a great sense of humor. We have incredible chemistry. I've been to Mexico several times, and she's been to the U.S. My family loves her, and her family loves me. We have talked about marriage and kids. In many ways she is everything I could want. We have even bought each other little Cabbage Patch dolls that look like what we think our future children will look like. We usually ""skype sleep"" where we leave skype on facing each other when we lay down to rest.

She's a bit young (my preference in OkCupid was ages 25-34), but seemed very mature for her age when we met. She is currently interning in a state in the Midwest, and lives with a roommate in housing provided by the company she works for. We see each other once every 3 months. We are planning on moving in together once she is finished with her internship.


I have reached a point in my life where I don't sweat the small things. I try to pick my battles and take a stand on the big things, but try to be accommodating on the small things. I don't think she has reached that point yet. Unfortunately, I almost feel like she needs to have conflict in her life. She was not like this for the first eight months I was with her. It seems to have become pervasive that I am starting to wonder if this is a temporary phase or if she is revealing a part of herself I haven't seen yet and if that will complicate our future. How it now usually goes is that half our time together will be AMAZING, and the other half is TERRIBLE because unnecessary drama and fights ruin our time together. There is little in-between.


As an example, she is on her 3rd roommate in 4 months because of personal differences. In the first two weeks with her 3rd roommate she has already begun telling me the things she doesn't like about her roommate that she is going to have a talk with her about.


As other examples, she constantly makes an issue out of minor inconveniences in our plans to see each other. I'm currently paying for almost everything in the relationship (flights, food, entertainment, etc). She basically pays for gifts on annual holidays (birthdays, Christmas, and anniversary). Each trip to see each other is $1200 after you factor in the days I take off from work. Since I make ~$2800/month, live by myself, and pay all my bills by myself, I try to save money when I can because seeing each other every 3 months averages out to $400 a month! Here are some of the things that have become big issues for some reason:


- riding the train back from the airport instead of taking my car so I can save money on gas and airport parking 
- spending 3 days together instead of 4 because I can't afford to take that much time off work
- flying to her state to celebrate her birthday on the weekend instead of when it occurs in the middle of the week so I can work on primetime sales days (Tues/Wed/Thurs) to make money to pay for the trip in the first place
- cooking at home together a bit more instead of going out to a sufficient # of restaurants, 
- not buying her the gifts she wants when she wants them (I'm talking material things like a hat or a necklace she wants when she sees it on the spot), even though I have already bought her multiple *other* gifts on the same trip that have special and symbolic meaning for us and our relationship.


Honestly, I feel like if one person is paying for 99% of the expenses, complaining about almost every small thing is kind of petty and selfish. She says she appreciates it, but then goes on to fight over many mild inconveniences in the plans I make so I can make the trip work in the first place. I would think that since we both love each other and only get to see each other every 3 months, that simply being together would be such a joy in itself that we can forget the small things. That's how I see it anyway.


Things like politics also become huge disagreements. I never initiate a political discussion, and I have a ""live and let live"" view of talking to people about politics. I think disagreements can be a good thing, and are a healthy thing in a democracy, and just because I have reasoned myself into a certain position doesn't another person's view invalid. Our political discussions aren't limited to the US; she wants to talk about politics in Mexico, the U.S., and Canada. I'm ok with talking about it so long as we can agree on some things and disagree on others. Unfortunately, she doesn't see it this way. She initiates a discussion and QUICKLY makes it personal if there is any disagreement. I ask her to please not make it personal, but she cannot help it.


Sometimes after we finish an argument her roommate will walk into the room. She will then half-abandon our skyping to talk with her roommate about how much she doesn't like her job, the people she works with, the customers, and so forth. This happens once a week at least.


We usually Skype every night for 2 hours or so. Lately I have opted out of skyping simply because I want a night of peace. One of the things I cannot stand is working hard all week and then coming home on a Friday night to a small thing that is made into a big issue and a lot of unnecessary drama. That's when I want to relax the most!


When she makes an issue out of any of these things we sometimes argue for *hours*. Sometimes until 2-3AM in the morning when I have to work the next day. I then come into work the next day worn out. Sometimes I have even missed my alarm and gotten to work late because I overslept because I was worn out from a night of unnecessary fighting (otherwise I would have only gotten 3-4 hours of sleep). I have lied to my boss on several occasions as to why I came in late because I wanted to keep our relationship issues private. I'm one of the best salespeople at my job and generate 30% of the company's sales revenue on a 10-person sales team, so it's not like I'm in a high danger of being let go. However, at 32 I really feel like this is beneath the standards I should have for myself.


We've talked about these things several times. She apologizes for things, which is good. We'll have a great week, but then the week after that the cycle will repeat. This has basically been the case for the past 4 months.


I love this woman and have dreamed about a future together. There are so many good things about her. But I have a genuine concern that if we start living together after she is finished with her internship, will I trap myself in a life of constant negativity? Do I wait it out and let her mature a little bit? Or is this just who she is and is there no way she can change?


TLDR: girlfriend and I are AMAZING together, but she now seems to need constant conflict in her life and it's wearing me out. Should I wait it out or develop an exit plan?"

I go to a psychiatrist, actually a student of psychiatry, which is a free counseling service my school provides. Still nice to have someone to express how I feel.

But for all good things I have right now, I have a burden from past because of a big 1.5 years missing because of depression.

My GPA is 1.6 (I am increasing it as fast as possible)

I have no internships after 3 years at college (we need to have 2 internships to graduate)

I joined a club for a semester, but because of depression I had to leave. A lot of people that joined same time as me are now high ranking members.

I don't know anyone in any sector to find a job when I graduate or any internship.

I have no hobbies other than working out. I used to develop video games, make pixel art, 3D modeling etc.

While there are people 2 years younger than me on their 3rd internship, know a lot of people from various sectors, have 3.0+ GPA and are a high ranking member in a club.

I feel like I have what it takes, and I am in a better situation now. I am more productive, even more productive than anyone I know. But I always feel 1.5 years late.. and don't exactly know what to do.

I don't even know what kind of a career I want when I graduate..

I wan't to be highly successful, I don't want to 1.5 years behind, I want to be years ahead.

But I feel it is a little late, I should just focus on graduating and find a job and live my life average and die..

But I don't want to be average, don't get me wrong, I am not disliking the idea of being average, it is better than hitting rock bottom but I want to be on the top as much as possible.

But like I said, I don't know what to do, what exactly to focus on. I want to be good with people, not like having tons of people around me, having a few good friends and being good with others that I know. I also want to have a successful career.

I am studying Applied Mathematics and Sociology and want to have a career that focus on.. numbers and being social? Like I said, I don't know.

I just want to do a lot of stuff but I am highly confused"

Long time lurker, first time poster here. Normally I'd lean on friends and family for support in this time, but I hang with a majority straight crowd, so I figured I'd get some perspective from my fellow gaybros.

Not really sure where to begin, but here goes. I'm 23 and never been in relationship prior to meeting ""Carlos."" I was a late bloomer when it came to emotionally opening up to people, largely due to my long time denial of acknowledging that I was gay. I'd had a lot of sex, so I wasn't physically inexperienced, but hoo boy did I have intimacy issues...

So on to the story. I go to university four hours away from my home town. I was on Spring Break at home visiting my mother when Carlos messaged me on Grindr. He was extremely attractive, but I was very turned off with the way he approached me and the way he spoke to me. Usually, I have a lot of self-respect, but he was f*cking hot and I was bored and horny, so I went to his house anyway. You guys know the routine: introduce yourself, make awkward small talk, do the dirty, then leave and never hear from each other again. Well, Carlos was different. His house was in a great neighborhood, he had a nice car parked in the driveway, and his place was pretty clean. This guy had his shit together!

We got to the awkward small talk but... it wasn't awkward at all. We spoke as if we had known each other for a long time. He even cracked open a (expensive) bottle of whiskey and we indulged. We ended up talking for over four hours and I left (because it was getting late) without even having sex with him. WHAT?!?!?!

For that entire week that I was in town, we were inseparable. The first thing I did that next morning was text him and see what he was doing, and he had the day off and we went to the beach together. He brought his friends along and I fit in with his group as if we had all been friends for life. It was very strange, but oh so much fun. That Spring Break was the best week I've had in my life. We literally spent the entire time together when he wasn't at work, and (finally) had lots of incredible sex and good times. When I left to go back to university, we agreed that there was a spark there and would keep in touch.

Keeping in touch turned into he and I alternating driving back and forth between each other's cities every weekend. We were getting extremely close extremely quickly. Everything we were doing was all new to me. Going out to dinner, introducing him to my friends/family, bringing him home... I had never done this for a guy before. We agreed that we really liked each other and made a mutual decision to delete Grindr and become exclusive. HOLY SHIT WTF IS HAPPENING TO MY LIFE!!?!?

Unfortunately, the timing of when we met was probably the worst thing about this whole thing. The commute, while inconvenient, was doable and totally worth it. Seeing each other two days a week wasn't super ideal, but we were making it work and I was almost about to graduate anyway. However, I had a study abroad planned since before I met him that was a six week long process. the day before I left, we had a very nice day together where we did all of our favorite things and we had the best sex I've ever had in my life (still is). We called each other every day while I was there, but toward the end of it, he was expressing a lot of uncertainty and discomfort about our relationship. He told me that the distance was extremely hard for him (me too! I'm in a foreign country where I don't know anyone and don't know the language!!) and he didn't know if he could hold out until I got back. I literally had to almost beg him at one point to just stick out the remaining week and a half and that when I returned, we could resume where our happy lives were.

It felt like an eternity, but when I finally got back to the US, things were different. We had planned on him picking me up from the airport and spending a week with me, but his car broke down the day before he was supposed to come. I was super disappointed, but made the drive up to him instead. While I was nervous, when I finally got to his house, it was like nothing had changed. We instantly picked up where we had left off and were happy for the coming months.

Then, I finally received word back from the government that I had been accepted for a super competitive and prestigious internship program that I had applied to almost a year ago (before I met Carlos). While I was thrilled with the prospect of landing this opportunity, I was also simultaneously saddened that I would have to leave Carlos for another five months.

While he told me he was happy for me, I could tell he was also sad and disappointed. Declining the opportunity was not an option, so I vowed to make the time we had together before I left the best it possibly could be. He, however, was not feeling it. I would try to hang out with him, but I would get lame excuses (not feeling well, working extra shifts, too tired, etc.). Again, I almost felt like I was begging for his attention. I finally asked him why he was acting so weird, so he explained that he was acting emotionally distant on purpose so that it wouldn't hurt so much when I finally left.

I was baffled. If I'm leaving for a while, wouldn't you want to spend as much time as possible with me? Why is trying to spend time with your boyfriend a bad thing? We eventually ""compromised"" that in the two weeks before my departure, we would spend nine of those fourteen days together. It wasn't what I wanted, but it was better than nothing. The night before I left, we went out to a great restaurant and had another great round of sex. We vowed that, even though it was going to be emotionally taxing, we would still be together and pick back up where we left off when I came back. I was all set to graduate and would be moving back to our city, so we could have a real relationship.

So I get to this new city and am overwhelmed by everything. The responsibilities of the internship were more than I was expecting, I was moving into a new place, trying to meet new people, and overall adjust myself to a new life. Carlos had been my rock through this whole time. We would call/FaceTime/Skype every day. It was very hard, but we were acting the same way we did while I was abroad.

Fast forward to these past two weeks and the reason for this post (gee, finally right!?). He has repeatedly been mentioning a lot of stress and important decisions in his life, but keeps being vague. Telling me he'll explain everything when I get back. I honestly can't really imagine what is going on, but I know it's been causing him an extreme amount of stress and anxiety. He started ignoring my calls. He'd just text me ""Can't talk, love you."" or ""Today has been rough. Talk to you later."" but that later would never come.

""Later"" finally came this past Friday. I was in a meeting when my phone starts blowing up. It's a rather important meeting, and my duty as an intern is to transcribe everything that is said, so I couldn't really excuse myself. When I finally had the opportunity, I called him, and what ensued has left me so confused and shocked.

He started going on about what a great and wonderful guy I am, how smart/ambitious/handsome/blah blah blah I am. I was flattered, but could tell something was off. Then he dropped a bomb. Because I was such a sexual and casual person before I met him, he felt like he was holding me back and wanted to cut me loose so I could enjoy myself. He stated we could be friends from here on out, and that I'm a special person that means a lot to him, but he knows that I am unhappy with him and for my own good, he is cutting me loose and would prefer if we dial back what we to just a platonic level. I was so shocked that I couldn't even speak. Here I am at work trying not to burst into tears in front of my superiors.

I finally managed to ask him WTF he was talking about and that I have been the happiest I have ever been. He told me that the distance was just too taxing and that he is at the end of his physical and emotional rope. He felt like he was in a relationship with his iPhone rather than with me. He kept reiterating that he didn't want to lose me, but that we shouldn't be involved romantically, only platonically. He told me that while I may not agree with it, he is doing this for my own good and that we could still talk, but we'd have to dial it down.

I was floored. I still am. This is the guy who would call me drunk at 3AM and leave me voicemails, half in English, half in Spanish (love that) that he loves me more than anyone in the world and that I'm the most beautiful, special person he's ever met in his life. I tried calling him later that night when I got back to my apartment, but he wouldn't answer. We just texted that he likes me a lot, but can't be in a relationship with me. He is ""setting me free"" to do what I please with who I please, and then when I come back (in less than one month!!) we can be friends and still do stuff together, but no sex and no intimacy. I don't want that. I want to be his. I want to kick his ass at Smash Bros. then make out with him and have marathon sex sessions. I don't want to just be ""Hey, how ya been buddy!?"" What we have (had?) is something special and I can't lose that.

What complicates this further is that we have a big trip planned in a week. The tickets and accommodations are already booked, so it's not really something that can be easily changed, but I don't know how I'm going to react on this trip. I want to have dignity and self-respect, but my urge is to just throw myself at his feet and beg for his love back.

This past weekend, I've been acting crazy! I lay awake all night thinking about him and all the fun moments we've had together. How he is the first guy I brought home to my mom (who is not 100% comfortable with me being gay), how we traveled together, all the cute pics we've taken together... just everything! I got so desperate, I called his best friend and told him everything that has been going on. His best friend was shocked, but told me that Carlos has been going through a lot (wouldn't elaborate) in his personal life at the moment, and that he still really likes me. I just don't know what's going on anymore and have felt completely blindsided, gutted, shocked, and most of all, extremely sad. He won't respond to my calls/texts and my friends are telling me to just give him space.

I know you all will probably tell me that this is a red flag and that I should move on, but I can't. If he calls me one of these days and admits he made a mistake, I would take him back in a heartbeat. I just can't bear the thought of throwing away almost a year of some of the greatest experiences I've ever had.

So my question to you all is, WTF do I do? Do I just sit here and wait in agony for him to MAYBE call me and explain himself? Do I act like nothing at all is wrong when I see him in a week for this trip? Do I try and have a serious discussion with him at the risk of being pushed away? This is all so sudden and confusing that I'm having a hard time processing it all. I haven't ate or slept well since he dropped the bomb. I don't want to lose him, but I can't go much longer feeling like such shit."

Now I will go internship for Jan - May so I will not be registered as full time student and will graduate on August. I need to buy insurance by myself for Jan - August. (The company for my intern does not provide medical insurance for intern).

Current our school insurance is spring+summer semester combination; I can't buy it just for spring or summer. And it's really hard to find in-network doctors at outside of GA (current insurance company is BCBS-GA).

For Jan - May, I will work in NY and stay in NY/NJ/CT (need to find place for intern)
For May - Aug, I will stay in GA to graduate on Aug. 

All website of health insurance companies ask me zip-code so I need advice to start.

5808lu,0,2016-10-17,There are way too many coincidences in assaults on Trump - by Andrew Malcolm (McClatchy),ShaunaDorothy,leftwinger,https://www.reddit.com/r/leftwinger/comments/5808lu/there_are_way_too_many_coincidences_in_assaults/,"A few things you’re unlikely to read elsewhere: Donald Trump’s presidential candidacy – and Americans’ ability to choose their next leader – is being destroyed by a sequence of events way too well orchestrated to be coincidental.

This is not about the billionaire’s qualifications or disqualifications to move into the Oval Office, his braggadocio, his awful manners, alleged sexual harassment, crass behavior, ostentatious wealth.

Americans have had unsavory political leaders before, most recently Hillary Clinton’s charming unfaithful hubby who, among other things, received oral sex from an intern in that same revered office. And then lied about it to authorities.
This is about Americans being politically manipulated quite cleverly, something people do not appreciate, if they’re allowed to be aware of it. Recent events could be a movie called “Wag the Dog – Again.”

Let’s consult the autumn timeline: A few days before the first presidential debate last month, The New York Times says it received anonymously some select pages of Trump tax returns from a generation ago.

They’re extremely tempting for media exploitation because Trump has declined to release tax returns, which isn’t required but has become routine. If you want media to chase anything, tell them they can’t have it. It’s like catnip; they can’t help themselves.

These tax pages, which the newspaper claims arrived in an unmarked envelope, showed a huge Trump business loss. Yes, it’s illegal to release personal tax information. But recall the IRS selectively crippling conservative non-profits during Obama’s reelection bid in the 2012 cycle by stalling their applications.

The president professed outrage then to match public outcry. Investigations followed. The once-respected FBI said it was stumped, could not find anything worth prosecuting in a federal agency selectively going after a president’s political opponents in an election year. End of story.

So, Trump taxes reentered the media news stream.

Then, two days before the Oct. 9 debate an “Access Hollywood” tape gets leaked with awful audio of Trump boasting crudely about using his wealth and celebrity to successfully grope and kiss women at will.

This endlessly replayed tape, which relies on the thrice-married Trump’s reputation for crudeness and affairs, caused widespread disgust and gave some Republicans cover to un-endorse the GOP nominee. All of which helps Clinton.

Now NBC, which employed Clinton’s daughter at a salary far beyond her experience or talents, has possessed this terrible tape since 2005. It was suppressed throughout Trump’s highly successful run hosting 186 episodes of “The Apprentice,” which was on – Oh, look! – NBC.

The network that was so shocked over Trump’s professed indiscretions has replaced Trump as Apprentice host with another media celebrity and adopted Republican politician, Arnold Schwarzenegger, who announced his gubernatorial candidacy on NBC. Schwarzenegger impregnated the family maid, causing a divorce from Maria Shriver, a prominent member of the Kennedy clan, who once worked for – Oh! – NBC.

Four days after the video leak, a growing string of women separately, but coincidentally, found the will and strength to break their sometimes decades-long silence to publicly declare they too had been groped and kissed by Trump.

Trump has vehemently denied these allegations. He’s apologized for his sexual boasts, which he claimed never really occurred. But that put him on defense, which he kept playing. And which the media kept covering.

All this continued to submerge Clinton’s own scandalous troubles. Using hacked emails from an unidentified source, WikiLeaks released thousands of Clinton campaign emails. They revealed disdain for Catholics, secret links with journalists, collusion with the family foundation and against other Democrats, duplicitous political positions, campaign infighting and devastating evaluations of Clinton’s talents by her own campaign chief.

Let’s see, which story do you think would draw maximum interest – combing through thousands of pages of stolen documents revealing an unpopular, untrustworthy Democrat proving why she’s unpopular and untrusted. Or obnoxious TV celebrity accused with perfect timing of sliding his hand up women’s skirts, just as he had boasted on tape?

None of this addresses the truth of these charges. Clinton has often said female victims of sexual predators should be believed by default. Unless it seems they’re accusing her husband. She attacked them.

What this sordid chapter does address is a pattern of perfectly timed video embarrassments against Clinton opponents. Barack Obama, now her staunch proponent, faced a series of leaked videos of his preacher’s racist, anti-Semitic sermons.

They did not derail his candidacy in 2008. This year’s version – about a onetime Clinton friend, donor and longtime Democrat turned Republican – seems likely to be more effective.

581ag8,1,2016-10-17,113 days - brought me a whole new life!,Nirvana1991,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/581ag8/113_days_brought_me_a_whole_new_life/,"I've recently broke my highest streak, which was 113 days. I never thought i was actually going to relapse ever again. But it's amazing how easy you can slip back into that shit-hole PMO life. 

So, this is how it went down. All of a sudden, i caught a cold and became sick which kind of thew me off of my grind and left me feeling pretty shitty for few days. Also i quit smoking cigarettes around the same time. The shitty sickness feeling, the insane withdrawals symptoms from quitting cigarettes, stress from work and school, all hit me at once. As a result, i relapsed and all i took was some self-touching in the shower and boom! that's it. 

Words can not describe what those 113 days brought to me. It literally brought me a new life! After what i've experienced those days, i'll do anything in my power to take that life back again and nothing can stop me. I can compare my journey to driving a Ferrari for 113 days and wrecking it because of a stupid turn. Even after wrecking the car, you would want it again at any cost, you will not be satisfied driving a 1998 Honda civic after driving a 2016 Ferrari (It could be any damn model) for almost 3 months straight. 

While I was on my streak, I've taken some of the hardest classes in my major (Finance) and killed them all. I go to a very competitive business school here in New York City and the average grades for those classes were Cs and C- and I ended up receiving As' and A-. Also I landed an internship at Wall Street this fall and not to mention the countless personal benefits such as increase of motivation, increase of focus, concentration, energy, will power  etc. that we are all familiar with but most importantly the happiest life i can ever imagine. 

The scary part is this, one single relapse can put you back in the same black-hole again. One single relapse can snatch it all away, all it takes is one touch, one little peak and eventually one relapse! Then you are back to binging on porn, back to that shitty life that we all wanna get rid off at any cost. 

This time I am gonna give it everything i got; to quit watching porn, to quit masterbating, quit them all for good. Now that i know what life is like without this crap and there is no way on earth i can let porn and masterbation take it all away from me.  "

	        token, created = Token.objects.get_or_create(user=serializer.instance)
	        return Response({'token': token.key}, status=status.HTTP_201_CREATED, headers=headers)

When someone wants to create new user via POST request if user name has't been taken yet, then API return 201 status code and token in JSON, if user name already taken it returns 400 status and error message in JSON. MY colleague request me to change status message to 200 when he tries to create username with name that already exist. He says that he can't consume the ERROR response.

His code looks like:
	        $http.post(url,{
            username:$scope.tel,
            password:$scope.passwd
        }).success(function(data){
            alert(data);
            $ionicLoading.hide();
            console.log(data);
        })

Question:
1) Should I tweak my API to send 200 status instead of more logical 400 for 'user already register' error?

I tried to change my code, But i couldn't find the method to override in CreateAPIView/ModelSerializer of DRF. I ended up rewriting my view class to method:

	@api_view(['POST'])
	def newUser(request):
	    """"""
	    Saves a new user on the database
	    """"""
	    if request.method == 'POST':

	        serializer = NewUserSerializer(data=request.data)
	        if serializer.is_valid():
	            serializer.save()
	            token, created = Token.objects.get_or_create(user=serializer.instance)
	            return Response({'token': token.key}, status=status.HTTP_201_CREATED, headers=serializer.data)
	        else:
	            return Response(serializer.errors, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)

Question:
2) If I want to change behaviorof API and responce, which method should I override 
3) I'm new to Django and still don't qiute know where we should use generic views VS. @.... methods

58319j,7,2016-10-18,I have recently went through a lot...,welpo,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/58319j/i_have_recently_went_through_a_lot/,"Hi guys.

I have recently posted a comment about my (kinda) terrible coming out, which I shall post here for some background: ""This past July both my parents found out. My dad said things to me that a father should never tell a son, kept me away from society by stealing my phone, computer and keeping me inside the house. I was not able to contact or see friends for the rest of the vacation period. He wanted to intern me on a psiquiatrist to ""cure me"". Once college started, on the second week of september, I finally gained strenght and courage to leave that house""

Thing is: I started dating this amazing guy back in March. He was my first love and the guy who I lost my virginity with. Things were good. When the coming out problem happened, we ended up talking almost never during the full vacation period, which resulted in me suffering even more. So when college started, I moved out and we finally met, I could see that we were both really nervous. I felt the things between us werent the same but he was the one who brought the break-up conversation up. Since I was still kinda in shock for leaving my house, I knew I needed some time alone for myself in order to adapt to the new society I lived in. 
2 weeks passed and I found myself with a more stable life and happier about being out of that house. So it was around that time that I started missing what I had with my ex. Its nothing too serious....Im not crying and smashing my head against the wall over this. But almost everyday I remember us..and I feel this strong pain in my chest. We were friends for some short time before dating, we still see each other and talk almost everyday because we basically study the same thing and we have mutual friends. The idea of stopping talking and seeing him, for some time at least, has crossed my mind, but I keep feeling that would make this transition even harder since I dont really want to loose him as friend.
This are a bunch of new feelings for me, I have searched for solutions but still It seems I have no idea how to deal with them."

But after 6 months of actively trying to find employment. I feel completely lost and wanted to ask on here how people think.  
  
I am a recent bachelor of mech eng graduate. I always set my mind towards the aerospace engineering. But I was unable to find an internship during my undergraduate program. So I worked as a research assistant for number of different professors. (longest one is one year in aerodynamics research)  
I graduate with 3.42/4.00 and got accepted to master's program at a really prestigious program. (probably within top 5) It's taught-master's program focused on aeronautical engineering. Till this point I was ecstatic. I got into grad school of my desire for a program I wanted. But the reality set in when I deferred the program for a year. (I will be attending next October)  
  
Due to personal circumstances, I decided to defer from entering the program for a year. So in the meanwhile, I decided to apply for jobs/internship positions. Initially, I applied mainly to aerospace industries. But after few months of applying and not hearing anything back, I broadened my application to basically any entry level engineering jobs.  
  
6months has past since I graduated.......... and I received ONE interview. It was for an internship position. Funny thing, first question the interview/recruiter asked was whether I'm enrolled in a program atm or not. I specifically outlined my situation on my resume/CL/application. But I repeated myself to the recruiter and was rejected as apparently I have to be ""enrolled in a program.""   
  
That's the only one call-back I received from probably 100~200 applications I have sent over the last 6 months.   
  
At  this point, I don't know what to do... Do I just do nothing for a year? Maybe relax and try to sort my personal life out? Give up on getting internship/jobs?  
But if so how will getting a masters be any different? Even though its a really good program at a really good school, how will it make things better? I graduated from top university in my country and still cant get a single call-back...  
  
So now I'm just completely loss. I don't know what to do anymore to further my career and whether I should even do masters. (even though I really want to do masters, if it doesn't help my career, what good is it in the end?)  
  
Sorry for the rant and wall of texts. Any advice would be highly appreciated. "
5840bh,46,2016-10-18,Three Years (Exactly Today) in the Making,ViviMan65,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/5840bh/three_years_exactly_today_in_the_making/,"On October 18th, 2013, I arrived home from a long day from school.  I started law school in August, and was going against the advice of dating while in law school. I was tooling around on OKCupid, when I saw this profile of this beautiful woman. Good percentage match rate, very much into the same nerdy things as I was, and beautiful. 

I don't know what caused me to say what I did, but I simply sent her a message stating that, ""I really don't do this, but if you wanna take a chance, meet me &lt;place&gt;, tonight at X time. I'd like to go around downtown with you.""  For some odd reason, she said yes, after I promised her I wouldn't abduct her or take her kidneys. 

We met in the city where she was living, right outside the new bookstore. We sent inside, and looked at the different books, and talked about ourselves. Time turned into hours, and we walked around and did various things. The night ended with me dropping her off at home, making sure she got inside safely. 

A week later, we went to my friend's Halloween party. There we had our first kiss, and she made sure my drunk ass got home safe that night (side story: we still have couple costume planned where I go as Link and she dresses up as Navi--whereby she would slap any booze out of my hand, while exclaiming ""Hey! Listen! Don't drink that!""). From that point on, she stayed at my house during the weekends. During the week, she made sure that I kept my studied up for law school--a rare gem and quality for anyone whose significant other has gone though that exercise in lunacy. However, that following spring, her job recalled her back to her real home in Wisconsin. We now had to navigate a long distance relationship. 

After almost three years, she finally landed ""permanency"" at her job: her company wouldn't shift her around the United States. However, it was in Wisconsin. I finally graduated law school, already passed the bar exam, and found a job with a local county government. Now what? I helped her look for jobs, edit resumes, cover letters, and so on just as I did a few months earlier. 

Three years ago, today, I started dating and falling in love with the most stunning, beautiful woman I have ever met. The amount of things we have done: the memories, the adventures, the ups and downs. I'm am blessed to have such an amazing relationship with someone who is loving, understanding, and ready to face the challenges of life as a team.

I explain all of this, as we have been long distance for approximately 75% of our relationship. I also explain all of this because we do have an end date: December 15, 2016.  That is when I will be taking my one way flight to Wisconsin, to help this amazing person move from her location, to our new home in New York. She was able to get a transfer back to her company's location in the city we met in. Back to the place where it all began.

Now I have bored you all with this story of how I met the love of my life. There is a few things I have learned these past three years, and I will provide this unsolicited advice, in order to provide some ""morals"" to this story. 

1. **Don't stop communicating**. Silence in a long distance relationship is a killer. Sure, even when a fight occurs, you need time to cool off. But don't go to bed angry (you won't get any sleep). Talk. Explain your feelings, and understand where each other is coming from. The reason why the fight occurred was because communication didn't occur, as it should have. Then you learn how to express yourself when a situation occurs in the future. The communication also helps on a daily basis. We texted throughout the day. But we made sure to always call each other--even if for 5 minutes, to talk about our respective days and to say goodnight. That regular communication helped our bond.

2. **Still date**. Yes, you still need to date your significant other. Except, it's gotta be done in different forms. Although it may seem like a plug, it's not: [Rabbit](https://www.rabb.it/) really helped us and made things easier. We could plan on watch the new episode of Game of Thrones or Doctor Who. Figure out ways to do things together, from afar. 

3. **Long term planning for visits**. It's super hard when you are an adult in the real world. Especially since she was working a job with limited amounts of vacation time, and I was in school. Thankfully, I was able to get an internship in Wisconsin, and we enjoyed an entire summer together. I made a trip out to her parents place for Christmas. She came to my law school graduation. You just have to plan and always look forward to the next time. 

4. **Don't give up**. Fight. Fight hard for each other. Support each other to close the distance. If there's something that my story shows you, it's that you are a team and that both people need to keep on fighting to close the gap. It took us three year and sheer luck. But it happened. It occurs. It's not a great white buffalo. It's as common as the sun setting and rising each day. 

So, learn from me. Adapt from me. And above all: know that it is possible and can be done. "

Family: None

Early Life:
Maxim was born in 1947 in Medlow a small City in the UDSSR. His father, a worker in a steelmill and his mother, nurse, dies shortly after his 12th birthday in an ambush by rebels. This event probably led to him joining the army. In the army he soon became
a skilled soldier excelling his comrades.

He participated in both the
""Oil-War"" and the War against the Rebells. After recieving various Awards he was offered a position in one of the famous ""Liquidation Squads"" of Kvostok (NOTE: Maxim Sedov was an ultra nationalist fighting in every war the UDSSR entered. According to witnesses he was proud of what heinous crimes he did in the war, since the helped his country)

In 1975 he was allegedly fataly wounded when he was on a mission to kill the remaining members of his ""deathsquad"".It appears this was a ruse fabricated by his superior who was later to be found out to be an undercover terrorist belonging to the ""Kiwasc-Cell"". In 2002 leaked documents showed that he was transported to a special underground facility, where various experiments where held.

All I've ever known is restaurant and retail and at my internship they kind of just left me alone to do data analysis and report my findings and well as my decisions and it was pretty simple. 

This job is on another level - miles ahead and I'm starting to think they have higher expectations of me than what I can produce for them just three weeks in. I have a ""big picture"" understanding of my job and the role it fills, and I understand conceptually, but not in practice and it's disorienting. I barely have a full understanding of what's going on and what the processes actually involve, when I'm supposed to talk on a conference call, what I'm supposed to say, when I'm supposed to answer an email, when I'm not supposed to answer an email, etc. It's giving me really bad daily and panic attacks right about when lunch hits, so I run and hide in my car during lunches to ride it out.

I'm good at putting on a face and seeming okay when I'm not - to a point. And I find myself hitting that point every day. 

I'm so emotionally unintelligent when it comes to admitting that I can't handle something or if my expectations of myself aren't met that just talking about it to other people makes me cry. Fucking me always crying I wish I just couldn't cry. Then I get frustrated that my default position is to cry and then I cry more.. 

I feel like I just can't get my shit together and it's a huge wall in the way of my goals. What do I do? How do I confront this without looking pathetic to everyone? 

I don't want it to come to me telling them about my asd because they already talk crap about some of the men here who are definitely on the spectrum and then people don't understand why I can seen some normal compared to guys who have it. 

I know I'll get a hang of this job... Eventually... but it would be nice if every day didn't have to be broken down into intervals between me having emotional breakdowns.

Dennoch möchte ich selbst dazu ein Thema öffnen um mal direkt Antworten zu erhalten von jedem der dies liest und sich auch Sorgen macht.

Meine Rede bezieht sich auf die Klickzahlen des Senders. Gefühlt sind diese immens zurückgegangen seit dem switch auf Youtube. Und ganz ehrlich gesagt verstehe ich das auch weil Youtube einfach nicht hot ist. Ich habe jede der Ansichten probiert und selbst mit dem Twitch Cover Add on ist es nicht mehr das gleiche feeling wie bei twitch. Es ist irgendwie quatsch aber ich hab jedenfalls so ein Gefühl das es weniger cool und Indy ist wegen Youtube und schalte deswegen nur noch für 1x die Woche live ein undzwar wenn Kino+ läuft und ich nicht arbeiten muss. Den Rest gucke ich mir On Demand an. Augenscheinlich und ohne Analyse sehen die Zahlen auch geringer aus als noch vor einem halben Jahr.

Bei mir persönlich hat das einschalten auch allgemein nachgelassen weil ich nun eine feste Freundin habe und wirklich viel, viel Zeit mit ihr verbringe. Meine Liebe zum Programm und den Jungs ist ungebrochen.

Aber wie ist es bei den anderen Teil der Zuschauer? Braucht man frische Ideen? Sind allgemein gaming Inhalte langsam ausgelutscht? Wäre nett wenn wir hier einen kleinen Austausch hinbekommen oder vielleicht schon eine klare Antwort von jemanden der es besser weiß als ich.

586xx4,2,2016-10-18,No time or money for friends or relationship,jam_of_pearl,lonely,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/586xx4/no_time_or_money_for_friends_or_relationship/,"So, I just realized that I haven't been out in approximately two months. Before that, it might have been more than two months. 

I have a pretty busy schedule where I go to school full time, have an internship, and work on the weekends. I barely have enough time to sleep--I've resorted to taking sleep meds just so I can pass out immediately instead of tossing and turning and getting 2 hours.

So I'm busy all the time, I'm a poor college student with too many commitments. I had a group of friends back when school started, and now it's down to one friend that actually doesn't have time to hang out either.

I dated for a couple months after a big break up last year, but it turned out to be a fiasco. I'm not that interested in using any energy on impressing someone for dating anyway. 

So I'm super lonely with out any actual time or energy or money to commit to getting to know someone or making friends. I know the general advice from past therapy is to go to free events (I live near DC). But the counterargument to that (not that I really said anything in response) is that transportation, food, and parking still add up. Also, the whole lacking friends thing puts a damper on things. 

So I'm like a sitting duck. I feel like I have to sacrifice something in order to socialize. I could give up working on the weekends, but then I'd have no money to go out. I could put less effort in school, but I'm already barely putting in effort, yet still busy.

Anyway, I suppose the reason I'm posting this is because my birthday's in about half a month. I feel pathetic never saying anything about my birthday. Last year, I was busy and plans fell through with my other friend. I think I'm a glutton for punishment, because I just remembered that I went to a doctors appointment to find out that I had an STD from a date I went on after being dumped. Curable of course, but happy 22nd birthday to me. 

So that birthday sucked ass, and now I'm just going to pretend its a normal day when my 23rd comes around. I actually have a commitment with work that day, so I'll be spending that day alone in another city. 

Does anyone else find themselves too busy and incredibly lonely? I miss smiling and laughing. I rarely do that nowadays. I work at a restaurant, and its so tiring faking every emotion. 

I've been much worse before. Much more depressed. Now I just feel like I'm stuck in situation day after day, and it won't be over anytime soon. 

The only positive thing I can think of, is that I'm saving what money I do make, and I'm doing more self-exploration and deep thinking than I've done in my whole life. "

Too bad I was vaccinated.,LucyLegBeard,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/587jnz/mil_has_baby_rabies_too_bad_i_was_vaccinated/,"Husband and I moved into an apartment together about 6 months after our rushed wedding. He finished his program and was doing an internship in my college town so we could finally live together. I had 2 years left of school.


During this time, his cousin also got married but had a baby soon after. We started getting photos of this child sent to us. This was when the baby rabies began.


Each time we visited home, his mother would add a new baby toy to his old bedroom. All used, of course.  She found them at yard sells. He had a crib, an exercise saucer, a bouncy seat, among other things I could not identify because I never had children.
When questioned she claimed they were toys for when cousins come over to play.


Every couple of months, MIL would ask SO if I was pregnant (hint, I was not.) or tell him how she had a feeling I was going to be pregnant. It became a constant thing with her, calling and asking if I was pregnant this month...was I sure???  have I tested lately??? 


I was still in college, had several semesters left and we were not planning a baby, damnit. I finally called my mother crying. I was totally stressed out. This woman would not listen to me. We were in no shape to have children and she was still buying baby things to put in his room. It was to the point that we could not stay at his mother's when we came home from my college town due to all the crap in there.


My mom took initiative and called MIL. She told her that I was still in school and did not need the stress. Momma is very blunt and told MIL to stop badgering us before momma paid her a visit. Over night all the baby stuff disappeared from SO's bedroom. She still had premonitions that I was going to be pregnant ""very soon"" and was correct, but only if you count ""very soon"" as 10 years later. :)"

My degree is in Applied Mathematics with a concentration in probability and statistics. I am currently in my final semester taking a data analysis course learning linear regression. Unfortunately I kind of dicked around and it took me 8 years to graduate and my GPA is not the greatest.

I researched companies that were going to be there and even got a personalized email from my school that told me which employers to talk to. When I would talk to them and hand them my cover letter and my resume they would flip through it and one employer stated my lack of experience was a definite problem for an internship. I have one class project that I put on my resume. In that project we had to learn Python and MySQL. I also know MATLAB and R.

Just at this point I am feeling pretty defeated. I went into this degree believing it to be very versatile but none of the employers seemed to be interested. How can I come back from this and what would you guys do to help getting over this slump?"

Currently working for a mid size firm in NYC and I (half Spanish, half Asian) kind of feel alienated from white people. There's currently 3 interns including me working during the semester and the other 2 who are white are assigned more work and praise while I barely receive any (more than 90% billed to admin the past 2 weeks). I'm also not as comfortable talking about the things they like such as sports  and TV shows so I have 
a hard time connecting with them. I've talked to other minorities in the firm as well and they share the same sentiment as well. 

I worked at a pretty small diverse firm (Blacks, Hispanic, Asians) prior to this current job, and I felt more comfortable there. But I left for pay reasons. 

I just wanted to rant a bit and hear from you guys. I don't mean to come off as anti-white, but I hate waking up everyday going to the same place and feeling alone with no friends. I know they had a huge emphasis on diversity but all of it seems like just a facade. Has anyone else felt like this? Should I quit and move elsewhere where I feel more comfortable? Or should I try and address this with the firm?

* considering that there is a training period, does that mean that there is a starting date for the Residency?

* how should I view this residency? more as an internship, or really as a job?

* During my bachelor program, I specialized in robotics. Even though this is not strictly computer science, it definitely contains elements where programming is required. I am also willing to catch up on material before the residency in order to become admissible to the program. Would google still consider me as a possibility for the program, or is it exclusive for computer science students?

589oh8,5,2016-10-19,this action done within 5 Minutes while in distress is going to affect me for the rest of my career- seeking advice as a med student,doc3456,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/589oh8/this_action_done_within_5_minutes_while_in/,"Hi all

I am a MS 3 finishing my first clerkship (surgery). I had always wanted to become a surgeon (wrote a significant amount about it in my personal statement, reason why I switched from engineering to medicine), thus going into this clerkship I had placed the bar high for myself to perform well. Like most other students who want to do well, I found myself very stressed to do well in clinical duties and education. I worked as hard as I could in these aspects, coming in hours before the intern, knowing the patients better even than the nurses, always having my coat and pants pressed, shoes shinned, always prepping the patient (literally would be ready to intubate by the times the residents arrived to the OR every case), doing d/c summaries for patients in the hospital for months, giving educational/historical powerpoint presentations based on patient care, ect the list goes on

In the mix of trying to excel in clinical duties and education, I did not manage my administrative duties well. I found myself on a friday morning of the due date with a mid term evaluation form that I had not asked an attending to fill out yet. This form was purely for feedback and had no bearing on our grade, it was something we turn in signifying that we discuss how to improve. In myself deprived, anxiety thrilled, lack of 2 week exercise self, I impulsively signed the name under my attending....  I thought that I needed to get this done and that I wasn't going to hurt anyone. This attending however wasnt someone random, it was my research mentor that I worked with for a year. As soon as I turned in the form I felt as if a black drape was gowned over me. I went down to the PACU and couldn't even look my patient in the eye and felt disconnected from my surgical team for a week. I felt out of my body...felt like I betrayed my mentor who had trusted me, ect. After my emotions settled, I thought about coming forth, but felt that I perhaps learned my lesson with this near-miss and that exposing at this point would unnecessarily hurt me.

Long behold, the clerkship director found out the truth. I was already on her radar because I was tardy in updating my work hours (which she confronted me in front of my residents who filled out my evals). Was totally on her bad side from day one. 

I talked to my mentor about this and the crux of it was that he wants to view this as a learning lesson, even thought maybe this was a sign of the high administrative forms needed to be completed from students, and still felt comfortable working with me. We presented our papers two weeks later at a national conference. Obviously our relationship will never be the same, however. 

I am currently facing academic probation that will be written on my permeant record for residencies to see. An Adhoc promotions committee is being sorted now and depending on how the hearing goes and the verdict, it can range from no disciplinary action to expulsion. 

I have a relatively significant psych history. In early spring I took ""research"" time to handle mental health issues. I was suicide at that time to the point that my mom sold her home to live in my apartment. She currently lives nearby. I'm not making excuses for my actions, but do feel that there may have been multipul factors at play leading to act in uncharacteristic ways. 

A lot of things are up in the air...worked so hard to get here to a top medical school. Had ortho aspirations, was told that I will most likely have to apply to a less competitive specialty. Now I walk through the hospital bitter at myself, the institution, and medicine. I literally will have a scarlet letter- it doesn't matter if I apply to a ""less competitive specialty"". 

I am looking towards you reddit for advice on how to do damage control at this point and perspective on this situation.

Summary: Hard working MS3 on surgical rotation burnt self out to point of making a impulsive, stupid decision leading to possible academic probation and expulsion. impulsively signed evaluation form under attending b/c realized that was due within hours- form had no bearing on final grade, solely for feedback. PMH that may have contributed to uncharacteristic action significant for recent suicide idealizations resulting in my mom having to sell her home to observe me- currently lives near by. Wanted to do ortho- will most likely have to look into less competitive programs in less competitive fields now. Bitter at self, school, and medicine about potential scarlet letter. Seeking perspective and guidance. Will have final trial within 3 months determining judgement on this ordeal.

589zsa,26,2016-10-19,Missing in CT: Lisa Ann Calvo,missinginct,UnresolvedMysteries,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/589zsa/missing_in_ct_lisa_ann_calvo/,"This is the eighth of my “Missing in Connecticut Series.” I will be introducing you to the missing people of Connecticut every Wednesday (according to this list on CharleyProject: http://www.charleyproject.org/geo/eastern.html). Please see my history for the previous submissions and share your thoughts about this case below!

Please keep your eyes out for another post I will be making today about a potentially related case, Evelyn Friso! You can read the thread here: https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/589zy1/missing_in_ct_evelyn_frisco/

Lisa Ann Calvo was born on February 2, 1965. She was 4’11 and weighed between 100 and 110 pounds. She was a white woman with curly brown hair and brown eyes. Calvo had a tattoo of a spiderweb on her right thigh. She had another tattoo on her right leg. The subject of this tattoo has not been publicized; it appears LE may be withholding the information in the event they locate a potential suspect who they hope will incriminate themselves by identifying it. Her dental records and fingerprints are not available, but her DNA is on file. DNA was collected from her family members in September of 2014 to help locate the missing woman. This was done nine years after her disappearance. 

Lisa was from New Britain, CT, and resettled in New Haven, CT. 

When Lisa disappeared she was in poor health. She was homeless and she occasionally lived on the streets. Lisa last lived in Fair Haven. Fair Haven is a neighborhood in eastern New Haven. In 2010, the Mayor at the time, John DeStefano, Jr., (D,) summarized Fair Haven by stating that it is the most self-contained neighborhood in New Haven. People stay in the neighborhood to shop, eat, go to school, and worship. As of 2000, there were 4,724 households with 13,753 residents (an average household size of 2.91) in the area. The neighborhood has a history of poverty and related issues, such as homelessness and crime. Some areas have been gentrified, but many residents continue to struggle. If you ask the majority of New Haven residents, Fair Haven is one of the most dangerous areas in the city. (The other is known as The Hill, where poverty and crime are being pushed out by Yale’s expanding hospital.) Lisa lived on Murray Place, a side road which no longer exists because an apartment complex was built on it. She spent a lot of time on Grand Avenue, one of the main roads in Fair Haven. 

This case resonates with me because my graduate internship involves helping impoverished people, some of whom struggle with homelessness, in the greater New Haven area. I will be taking a few paragraphs to provide background information about this population, which may inform your view on this and Evelyn’s case. Many people do not want to enter transitional homes or shelters because it is devastating to admit they are homeless. They often choose to stay on family members’ or friends’ couches and occasionally scrape up enough money to stay in a motel. But, homeless people often burn these bridges in the long run, and are left to the streets (unless they seek services elsewhere.) 

According to a 2015 report conducted by the City of New Haven, as of 2014, 52% of New Haven’s homeless population struggle with substance abuse. 41% struggle with mental illness. New Haven has the highest percent in the state for homeless families. 566 homeless people were measured at that time. Due to the transience of this population, this is considered an underestimate. A general estimate provided is that on any given day, 700 people are listed as homeless in New Haven.

New Haven provides the most social services in the region to this population, so it is a destination for people in need. Many people are dropped off in New Haven by correctional facilities, and they don’t have the means to leave. So, New Haven is responsible for the needs of many homeless people in Connecticut outside of the city.

What are my thoughts on the homelessness in the city as someone who lives here? When I think of the homeless in New Haven, I think of strong characters. The first that comes to my mind- and I suspect that of many others- is “The Flower Lady.” You can see a youtube video about her here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbKcG5WZTk8. You can see some of Yale’s beautiful buildings in the first shot of the video. She is a woman who sells flowers a local deli-market cannot sell for $1. For those in the area, it is “Good Nature Market.” But let’s be real, everybody still calls it Gourmet Heaven. The old owners were forced to sell their business because they over worked and under paid their staff, breaking several labor laws. Selling a business to their close friends, keeping the same employees, and the exact same stock, does NOT make it a “totally separate business” as several media outlets claimed. It’s just a way to keep up appearances for well off residents. As long as nobody has to see how the employees are mistreated while getting their bacon, egg, &amp; cheese sandwich after a night of drinking, it’s not a problem!

In my experience, the city attempts to foster a safe environment - especially near the Yale campus. It is not friendly to homeless people and you do not see them linger as much as you do elsewhere. You may see some people sitting here and there, but is rare to see people sleeping on the streets. This is especially true for our green. The homeless get kicked off the benches there routinely. 

Like many homeless people in New Haven, Lisa was a heroin user, and she used sex work to support her habit. Detective Michael Wuchek said, “The drug world and that lifestyle is inherently dangerous. But when people are killed in that lifestyle, they’re not usually hidden. We find them. She’s just gone.” 

Lisa’s family last saw her on the morning of October 6, 2005, in Fair Haven. Lisa had lost custody of her two year old twins due to her drug addiction, and she told her family she wanted to start taking steps to get them back. She told them that she wanted to move back in with her parents and enter drug treatment. Her parents supported this decision and suggested she move back in that day. “She was determined to get herself back on the right track so that she could get her children back,” said the woman’s mother, Diane Calvo. She continued, “And that’s why a lot of this is sort of a shock because a lot of things were in place.”  Lisa also let her mother know she had a court appearance scheduled in New Haven, and asked her to wire her some money so she could travel to court. It is difficult to estimate how much money she would have reasonably requested for a taxi fare in a world without Ubers, but Grand Ave is about 10 minutes from the New Haven Court House, so I can’t imagine it being very expensive.  LE have confirmed that she picked up the money at 5:30 pm that day. Some media sources report that the last confirmed sighting was on October 13, not October 5th. It is not clear who supposedly saw her on that date.While Lisa’s family have not heard from the woman since October, 5, 2005, there have been possible sightings since that date.

Despite Lisa’s homelessness and substance abuse, she was in regular communication with her family, and it is unusual that they have not heard from her. This, plus her plans to move home on the day she went missing, alarmed her family.

The New Haven Police brought cadaver dogs to the Middletown Ave area of Fair Haven. They have also gone to the Russell Ave area of another New Haven neighborhood, Fair Haven Heights. This neighborhood is located next to Fair Haven, and it is also known as The Heights. Like Fair Haven, The Heights consists of gentrified sections and impoverished ones. The projects summit the hill. Interestingly, water quality of the Quinnipiac River has improved in the area, and they began oystering it again in the 1990s. The New Haven Police also searched the West Haven dump. West Haven is about 10 minutes away from Grand Ave. They also searched the woods and marshes. No trace of Lisa was found. 

In 2011, Lisa was one of four featured missing people on New Haven’s police website. This section has since been expanded to six people. Her profile remains up. This was part of an initiative for the department to focus on cold cases. Unfortunately, the post did not lead to any significant information. 

In March of 2013, a man was searching for scrap metal to create sculptures with at 126 West Street in Vernon, CT. Rockville landfill used to stand on the site. The site is about 50 minutes from the area of New Haven Lisa spent time in. 

The man discovered human remains that day. They were spread out across the old landfill. The remains were believed to belong to a 40 or 50 year old white woman with a narrow face and high cheekbones. She was believed to be between 5’ and 5’3. 40 year old Lisa, who stood at 4’11, seemed to fit the bill - but she appeared to have a rounder face when she was healthy and before she began using heroin. DNA and dental records were run through NAMUS without resulting in a match.  Unfortunately, many older missing persons reports were taken before DNA technology existed, making the search difficult. New Haven Police collected DNA from Lisa’s family for the first time in 2014 to compare to the found remains. That is 9 years after the woman went missing.  In 2014, law enforcement determined that the skeletal remains did not belong to Lisa. The police have since determined that the remains belong to Carol Shapiro, a 43 year old Manchester woman who disappeared in 2007. It is believed she took her own life. She left a note before she went missing, but the content of her note has not been disclosed to the public.   

In May of 2016, the governor approved a $50,000 reward for information about Lisa’s disappearance. Detectives and police posted reward flyers to 1,000 Fair Haven doors in hopes of getting a tip. 

The flyers produced a tip that Lisa may have been buried in the backyard of Catapano’s Autobody and Towing. The business still stands in New Haven and it is located on Kimberly Ave, an approximate 10 minute drive from Grand Ave where Lisa spent time. Law Enforcement did not suspect the business owner or employees had anything to do with any crime.They stated that the business was extremely cooperative. During the search Detective Wuchek said that Lisa’s family “deserve to know what happened to her. Her kids deserve to know what happened to their mom. She deserves our full attention.”  He has also said, “She deserves as much time, effort and blood, sweat, and tears as anybody else. If we don’t find her here, we’re going to continue to look. And not stop until we find her.” 

20 investigators dug at three separate, subdivided lots behind the business in search of Lisa’s remains in June of 2016. The lots were on either side of a fence. The search warrant allowed law enforcement to work for 10 days. They worked 12 hours everyday, and sometimes longer, in an attempt to find the missing woman. Members of the police department’s Major Crimes Unit and Bureau of Identification, the state police, and University of New Haven’s forensics department members were present. UNH is not located in New Haven, despite its name; it’s located in West Haven. It is an overly priced private school that is in a run-down area (although it is being “revitalized” with the construction of an apartment building and retail space, advertised directly for students.) The only successful academic department I have heard of is the Forensic Science department. I had a friend enter the graduate program and was able to intern with the homicide division of the New Haven Police. It has always seemed legitimate to me. Cadaver dogs were also at the search. The searchers got deeply sun burned and they bad cases of poison ivy. The search found nothing. 

LE are unsure what happened to Lisa. They have no theories - that they are sharing with the public, anyway. They aren’t even sure if she is alive or dead. They haven’t been able to find any evidence. Neither has a private investigator. 

Did Lisa change her mind about moving back home and entering rehab? Was she ashamed so she chose to stay away from her family? Would she have stayed away for so long - or did something bad happen to her? 

While LE does not believe the two cases are connected, Lisa knew Evelyn Frisco. Evelyn also had substance abuse issues she supported with sex work, and she disappeared a year before Lisa. The women are not visually similar, but there was a 3 to 4 inch difference in height. It is reported that they were the same weight by some sources; other sources report it could be up to a forty pound difference. Do statistics say that two drug using sex workers who happened to know each other would disappear without any connection within a year of each other? Were both women finally victimized by their drugs? Why are one third of the cases I’ve written about so far female sex workers?  When we only consider the female cases, half of them were sex workers. Is it just a dangerous lifestyle? Or is there something more sinister afoot in New Haven? Has the LISK begun making trips to New Haven - a city closer to New York than the one his established Connecticut victim is from? Were the women physically close enough to be a predator’s type?

Re: memo on govt reform/pulbic corruption
Mar 1, 2016 at 4:49 PM, Jake Sullivan wrote about several ideas and their public support:
&gt;- Increase government’s public reporting so voters know what goverment is doing ...66..

&gt;- Strengthen bribery laws to ensure that politicians don’ change legislation for political donations. 62%

&gt; **The second idea is a favorite of mine, as you know, but REALLY dicey territory for HRC, right?**

Wouldn't want those bribery laws strengthened now, would we? 

Neera Tanden's response:

&gt;This is a jump ball. **She may be so tainted she's really vulnerable** = if so, maybe a message of I've seen how this sausage is made,

Crooked Hillary Clinton is ""really vulnerable"" on corruption, folks. According to her own staff who know her really well.

Brent Budowsky and Podesta emailing each other, again. (they had almost 100 emails to each other in the 19 000 that came out so far). Budowsky writes:

&gt; And at a major university in Washington, D.C., where many of the kids come here  because of an interest in politics and are already working as interns,  there was not one student who gave enough of a damn for Hillary to open a booth, or even wear  a Hillary button----I didn't see one and I was looking.  

This pretty much explains why CTR's paid posting campaigns were needed for Reddit and Facebook. She does not have enough real supporters who ""give enough of a damn"" to actively cheer and support her. This is why they need masses of paid shills here on Reddit, to create the illusion of enthusiastic support. 

&gt; If there are secret Clinton talking points to surrogates to attack  Bernie---and I now  believe the story is true-----she is going to create ill-will that neither  she nor her  staff can even imagine. ..

&gt;What will happen if  this continues is Bernie will get pissed off and lash back and I can write  the  words he will say if Clinton tactics anger him----FBI investigation and aides  taking the Fifth will be among them---and it will not be pretty.

Podesta responds :

&gt;We already discussed Castro. Beyond that, why do you think that story is not just a bunch of hyped up BS intended to have exactly the kind of reaction you are exhibiting?

2015-09-15 Neera Tanden and John Podesta tackle the issue of Hillary in the primary. Is she a progressive or a moderate?

Neera writes:

&gt;Why did she call herself a moderate?

Podesta replies:

&gt;I pushed her on this on Sunday night. She claims she didn't remember saying it. **Not sure I believe her.** We were speculating, that it may be a  Don Baer intervention.

John Podesta, the chairman of the Hillary Clinton campaign, thinks that Hillary may be lying to him here. To even think this Podesta MUST believe that Hillary is a pathological liar who just can't stop lying. Podesta simply does not believe or trust her. You know your ""trustworthy"" numbers must be bad when you read ""Not sure I believe her"" from your own goddamn campaign chairman. 

Neera Tanden angrily responds

&gt;I mean it makes my life more difficult after telling every reporter I know she's actually progressive but that is really the smallest of issues. **It worries me more that she doesn't seem to know what planet we are all living in at the moment.**

Remember how tweets signed by -H supposedly come from Hillary personally?

Tweets like this one https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/612002144686874627
Archived version http://archive.is/u4Kwz  (no sudden deletions through BleachBit here)

The discussion in this email determined that that was a lie. Teddy Goff, John Podesta, Lauren Peterson and others discuss and craft that tweet through several revisions. Earlier versions include 

&gt;Real problems take real solutions. Thank you, @Pontifex  &lt;https://twitter.com/Pontifex&gt;, for shining a light on the crisis of climate change. -H


.


&gt;There's only one thing to say about @Pontifex &lt;https://twitter.com/Pontifex&gt;'s bold statements on climate change &amp; renewable energy: Amen. -H

&gt;I believe these are the two we landed on as far as people's favorites.

So there were even more versions before this...

Teddy Geoff:

&gt; Adding Podesta here too for his review. I vote #2, but defer to the  non-Jews on this thread if anyone thinks ""amen"" might rub people the wrong way.

Lauren Peterson

&gt; How's this?  .@Pontifex &lt;https://twitter.com/Pontifex&gt; is right—climate change is a &gt; moral crisis that disproportionately harms the neediest among us. We need &gt; leadership, not denial. -H

John Podesta

&gt; I like it.

Notice how that last version is the same that was tweeted out. So tweets signed by -H actually came when John Podesta ""liked it"" and went through numerous revisions, reviews and product of teamwork beforehand. With 0% actual input from Hillary Clinton.

&gt;Here is a draft statement opposing TPP. It's long, but covers a lot of ground. The goal here was to minimize our vulnerability to the authenticity attack and not piss off the WH any more than necessary.

Staff creates a statement about Hillary opposing TPP. Which is interesting because while staff creates this statement they admit she pushed and advocated for TPP.

Joel Benenson writes:

&gt;But the reality is HRC is more pro trade than anti and trying to turn her into something she is not could reinforce our negative around authenticity. This is an agreement that she pushed for and largely advocated for. 

https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/17724#efmAAGAD6

She was also championing TPP according to Jake Sullivan:

&gt;She has concerns about where TPP will end up. But denying potus negotiating authority to **finish a deal she has championed?**

Glenn Thrush is at it again. In a previous email defined himself as a ""hack journalist"" and pleaded with Podesta ""please don't tell anyone I did this"" when colluding with him. Now Glenn saw a bad tweet from Podesta and he immediately feels the need to grovel at his feet: 

&gt;Saw your tweet I think u know I wasn't fabricating you anything...  No need for a response, but I hope u understand that I take this stuff seriously and try to be sensitive to the human impact of these shitty  stories  I take zero pleasure in them -- whether u folks believe me or not  Cheers and good luck today

Podesta's response

&gt;..my tweet was accurate so 1) maybe you should question your sources or 2) maybe you are talking to people on the inside who the pressure is getting to.

Podesta decides to stonewall the WSJ. This email has the subject:Confidential . The staff is very very worried about the WSJ finding out that Hillary is already having meetings and building the campaign team in early 2014.  He milks info out of the journalist which he shares with the others so they can map out what the guy knows. For some reason they are very afraid of this one. Podesta writes about the meeting with the WSJ journalist.: 

&gt;He was doing a story on who wanted her to run, who didn't. Had you in the latter category Only thing I told him was there was a third category-people who thought it was her decision and would support her whatever she decided. He had you, me and Maggie meeting with her at Whitehaven. Didn't mention Plouffe. I didn't engage with him on the topic. Just let him talk and gave nothing back.

They made a complete fool out of this poor WSJ guy. He should come out and set the record straight regarding this issue.

opposition research director Tony Carrk sends a hurried email to Podesta and many other high ranking staffers:

subject: **If we get to talk to her on break**

&gt;**Have her mention climate change J**

Now just what this could be?  Seems very important to mention climate change, IF the staff can talk to her on break. If they update her talking points during the break they have to include climate change in there, writes Carrk. Now what situation could allow for such a break? Perhaps a debate against Bernie Sanders? Can someone look into whether there were any debates against Bernie during this time. This email strongly implies that they used the breaks in some type of event to update her talking points with the latest information produced by the team. This email was sent  on 2016-01-18  0:47 (just barely, seems more like the evening of 01-17 in a different timezone) 

UPDATE from a poster in the thread:"" ""View source"" shows that email was received by Podesta's ISP on Sun, 17 Jan 2016 18:47:14 (PST) which is actually during the Democrat debate on January 17 in which Crooked Hillary competed against Senator Bernie Sanders and other Dems.""

I recently graduated from an AEC of mobile dev and as you might have guessed, there's not a lot of opportunities for inexperienced programmers. 

So I'd like to ask other fellow devs, how did you get your foot through the door when you just can't afford to be an intern?

I'd do it if I could, but I have to work fulltime to pay the bills.

I'm trying to finish a personal project that I would be able to show as demo, but any other tip will be welcome.

Thanks and have a great one.

I majored in biology with a minor in nutrition. Got A's and B's in all of my bio/nutrition classes, more B's than A's though. C's in all my chem classes. As graduation is approaching im starting to freak out and I feel like I just didnt do enough during my years here in order to set myself up for a good position after college. Due to switching majors my sophomore year I had to take full summer semesters to catch up with my classes, so I never had time for an internship. I never looked for on campus research opportunities with professors, never had a job that was geared towards biology (mainly because on-campus jobs are so felxible with hours and understanding of school coming first that it was a better/closer option), and I didnt have outstanding grades. I will most likely finish school with a 3.3 GPA, and not much to fill my resume. I have one more semester here during which I'm going to try to find some on campus research, but even still I am just extremely concerned that my resume is going to look like a joke after graduation and I will not be able to find a good job. Not sure what to do or how to feel. Right now I just feel defeated because no matter how hard it felt like I was working at the time, the results I see now arent impressive what so ever. I just don't know where to go/what to do from here. This feeling is starting to really take over my daily life and it sucks.

TLDR; overwhelming feeling of disappointment in myself for what I accomplished (or didnt accomplish) during college as graduation approaches. Not sure how to handle it but it is really starting to affect me."
58bg9z,1,2016-10-19,Need help comparing two job offers!,how_to_computerr,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/58bg9z/need_help_comparing_two_job_offers/,"Hi /r/PF, I am a 25yo CDN in his last semester of a masters degree. I need your help comparing two job offers! (Ottawa vs San Jose)

Academic &amp; Professional Experience:

Undergrad in Electrical Engineering + 20 months of co-op

Finishing MASc in Computer Engineering + 7 months of Co-Op at Company 1

I'm currently finishing my thesis so I wasn't actively applying for jobs. Over the past two summers I did paid internships at large tech Company 1. Company 1 solicited me for some information on work preferences then came at me with a full on offer.

Offer 1 @ Company 1 (San Jose in USD):
120k base + 20 paid days off + 9.5k after-tax sign-on/relocation bonus + 5% 401k instant vesting + 5% annual performance based incentive + other benefits (med, optical, dental). It is an hourly - non exempt position and the recruiter assured me there would be plenty of opportunities to work overtime.
I was given two weeks to accept the offer and started flooding out resumes. I live in Ottawa, Canada, so I was applying all over Ontario, and elsewhere in California. Unfortunately I haven't heard back from most as I'm sure companies like Google &amp; Amazon have large backlogs. I recently had interviews with a large and steadily-growing tech company in Ottawa. Three groups wanted to hire me @ Company 2.

Offer 2 @ Company 2 (Ottawa in CAD) w/ group of my choosing:
72k base, 8% performance based bonus, full benefits, Pension matches 50% up to $3k/annum, + 1% of base salary + 20 days off (5 at Christmas, 15 flexible).

My gut instinct is that Company 1 has given me a great offer (they are relatively less competitive than other bay-area companies, but this offer is comparable IMO). I worked closely with some important people at Company 1 and it appears that this may have greased the wheels. The offer at Company 2 seems generic to a masters graduate. To me it feels they are not acknowledging that I effectively have over two years of working experience. I have not attempted wage negotiation with Company 2, but I will tomorrow and I imagine they could increase their offering somewhat (maybe 80k?)

Another important consideration. I am Canadian and my family lives near Ottawa. I have a serious girlfriend who is also in Engineering and makes ~60k CAD/year with decent benefits. She works in the clean energy sector. I don't expect her to uproot and move to Cali with me unless she has a tenable offer. She currently lives with her parents in Ottawa so is able to save quite a bit after expenses, but if I were to stay in Ottawa I have been direct that I would want us to rent our own place (minimal expense and I would like more privacy than we currently have).
Also important (values in CAD):

- I have $17k savings, and $24k owed to OSAP
- Own a car which would appraise ~6k (2011 Civic w/ 120kms)
- I would live &lt;4miles from work in SJ, would purchase a nice (~1k CAD) bike to commute
- Since my whole family lives here, I would want to visit at least 5x a year - I would set aside ~5k for rt-flights and leisurely expenses

What do you guys think? I made Company 1 extend the offer deadline by a week until this Friday. I will make a comprehensive budget tonight for both areas/COL and try to estimate what I will be able to save after tax in each location.

Please, any advice is greatly appreciated. Are there things I missed? Also, I think someone may suggest that even though my OSAP loan is exempt from provincial tax (until January), I should have already paid some of it down with my savings (less a generous emergency/travel fund).

Thanks in advance"

I've been working for a very small non profit for a few months now, there are 3 employees (including me) and a revolving door of interns.

There's the CEO, the manager, and myself. The ceo has quite a busy schedule and isn't there all the time, but she's often out doing things for the company (networking, fundraising)

The manager has a pretty sweet life, only works 4 days a week and basically keeps track of all the regulations and administrative stuff while the boss is out.
Over the past few months, the manager has been coming in less and less. From missing every Friday, to being ""sick"" other days, working from home, and taking a 2 week vacation, he's missed 49% of eligible work days for the past 4 months (I kept track)

Since his absence, I've been being thrown more work that's not within my job description and I've been getting criticized for letting things fall through the cracks. I don't wanna sell out one of my bosses, but I'm one person and I can only do so much. I'm the least senior employee, make the least amount of money, yet I'm asked to do the bulk of the work that keeps the company afloat. 

I want to quit, but I guess my question is what should
One do with this information? What would be the best way to approach either the CEO or the manager about one of the senior employees at the company showing up for work half of the time. There's like this unspoke understanding that I'm not to tell her whenever the manager skips work, but it's starting to impact my performance and general well being.

What does one do with this information and how should I confront the people above me about this problem?

Please help me help my boyfriend. 
He is 23 years old, Caucasian, 6'3"", 200 lbs, and has been feeling a lack of motivation for about 5 years or so. 
He smoked marijuana from about 19-22 years old. He has stopped since, but still has the urge to smoke because he said he feels anxious from time to time. 
He has zero motivation to get a job, and is indifferent about school, but still passes his classes. He has no money in the bank, but does not seem to worry about getting a job. He has gone out a few times to apply to places after pushing him to do so several times, but only goes to a few places at a time. 

He also has a very low sex drive, and we have sex about once a week. 

The thing is, he does not seem depressed to me. He will help me clean up around the house, go out on a hike, or walk around town any time I ask with a smile on his face. He is the most stable, consistent person I have ever known. He never gets upset at me, or loses his temper. His mood has stayed consistent as long as I have known him (we have known each other since elementary school).

He sees me working long hours on the weekends, working an internship, taking 18 units and maintaining a high GPA, but it does not motivate him to better himself in any way.

I love this man, and I wish I knew how to get to the bottom of this. Our personalities are so different, and so it is very difficult for me to understand why he is way. Our relationship has become very unequal financially as I am paying for groceries, vet bills, etc.

Why does he have no motivation to do anything serious?! Is this a medical issue or just a bad case of laziness?! Any advice is appreciated."

	Hey everyone, 

I've been struggling with this decision for a while and saw a few posts on the post 9/11 and other programs out there to help us get through school. A little about myself, I’m a prior CTT in the Navy with honorable discharge and decided to go back to school since I wasn't able to go officer or stay enlisted in my rate at the time. I'm at San Diego State University attempting to get a degree in Electrical Engineering. Basically I’m finding myself in a situation where I’m working a part time job and going to school full time. I went to community college and got my AA before attempting my major and my advisor says I’m roughly 2.5 years away from getting my degree after this semester is over. That leaves me with about 3 years to get my degree which is cutting it close in my mind. The post 9/11 has been a true blessing with expenses being taken care of with left over BAH. My fear is I know the classes I’m taking are hard and I need the extra time to study. So basically is it a good idea to just live off the BAH and risk it all on my degree or still keep my part time job (just in case) as a safety net until I start getting offered internships. I know there's no right answer to what I’m asking I’m merely looking for advice on how to plan my future. 

The second concern is if I use up my post 9/11 will I still be able to use VR&amp;E to finish the rest of my degree? I know post 9/11 pays the whole time you’re in school and if you have one day left on your benefits they pay for the entire semester but all I’m looking for is future possibilities?

Any advice or people going through the same situation would be greatly appreciated! "

58cv8n,4,2016-10-19,I [21M] am extremely similar to my girlfriend's [19F] ex [21M]. I fear she's pretending I'm him.,exissame,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/58cv8n/i_21m_am_extremely_similar_to_my_girlfriends_19f/,"Hello,

My girlfriend Shannon and I have been dating for about 5 months. However, we were long distance for 3 of those 5 months because I was on the other side of the country for a summer internship, so it's more like we've been dating for 2 months. Shannon is my first girlfriend, and I am her second boyfriend. 

Lately, I've started to become a bit uncomfortable by how similar her ex and I are. I've seen his pictures on facebook and we look very similar physically. We are the same race, wear the *exact same* glasses frames, have the same major and are looking to go into the same career, have very similar haircuts, and Shannon has mentioned once in passing that we have the same sense of humor. 

Let's call the ex Jim. Jim and Shannon dated for about a year, before he broke up with her because he got frustrated Shannon would not make enough time to spend with him, as Shannon is super hardcore with academics and has a 4.0 GPA, a job, and was participating in research at the time. From what I can tell, Shannon took the breakup badly, though she doesn't talk much about it. We met two weeks after their breakup and became bf/gf one month after that, right before the semester ended and I left for my internship

When we started dating, Shannon quit her research position shortly after, citing the fact that she wasn't getting much out of it and I found this strange because she seemed to enjoy it. After I learned ex broke up with her for not sending enough time, I now suspect she did that to spend more time with me and avoid the same mistake.

So far our relationship has been great. She spends a lot of time with me, as we study together for 4 hours together everyday. After we met, things picked up really fast and she became very emotionally invested in me very quickly. Now from her behavior, I don't sense anything wrong. I've never gotten the sense she's comparing me to him or see that she's still depressed about her ex or anything like that.

However, when I look at these facts, to me it seems very likely she's pretending I'm her ex, or using me to get over him. She goes through a hard breakup, meets someone very similar to her ex shorty afterwards, and gets close to that person very quickly. If this is the case and I'm just a plug for the hole she feels from her ex, then that's an issue because she'll eventually have to confront the fact I'm not her ex and the relationship would break down at that point. On the other hand, I'm suspicious of this being the case only because of the unlikely circumstances, and haven't seen anything to indicate this from her behavior.

What are your thoughts reddit? Am I being paranoid, or is this a possibility I should be concerned about? How should I handle this?

**TL;DR: I am very similar to my gf's ex. My gf went through a hard breakup with her ex, and started dating me, someone who's very similar, shortly afterwards. These circumstances make me feel she's pretending I'm her ex. However, I may just be paranoid because nothing from her behavior indicates this**"

It's becoming more frequent, I'd be fine for one day and then the following day depression takes over and lasts for weeks at a time. I'm so tired of this. I can't hold a job because while I start off doing great, I get bored and miserable and just can't perform well, then end up quitting. I'm also a full time student and honestly all I'm doing is stressing and studying. I have ADD so it takes me longer to get stuff done and that leaves me with no time for social life. I don't think I will ever be able to manage my time. I feel like I have no control over my life. I can't complain or confide in family because they just list how fortunate I am, and they're right. They provided me everything I needed and more. And it kills me that I can't just be happy or at least just not be depressed. My oldest brother's idea of help involve me doing things his way or no way, for example changing my diet/ exercise. I either follow his diet or no matter what I say I will be a dumb loser, who knows nothing and that I'm no special snowflake and that I need to just take control of myself and force myself to do shit. Sadly I don't have that will power, and I know he's right, but it doesn't help. Getting yelled at doesn't motivate me. Hell, I am almost never motivated or excited about anything. I don't feel bad for myself and I don't think of myself as a special snowflake, but I'm just not seeing how anything will change. I'm too busy for fun and socializing because I'm too busy and stressed about school work. Later it will be too much stress from work. And I'm left in a loophole. I tried antidepressants for a couple of days and I got even more depressed and couldn't function. I'm finding myself wanting to get away from everything. I have an amazing internship that I'm neglecting and I am losing motivation now in school too. I just don't care anymore. Why bother put all the effort only to continue feeling like shit later on. The few times I go to therapy I feel so pathetic for having to pay someone to hear my dumb first world problems. I hate it, I can't stand how I'm constantly in terrible moods. I just want to end it all already and save my family the college money and save myself from more depression. "

[21M], need help accepting that he may be interested in a mutual friend [23F].",helpmebefriends,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/58epil/me_22f_with_my_friend_ex_21m_need_help_accepting/,"Hello! I'm sorry for the novel, I'm super long winded! TLDR at the bottom, and this is a throwaway.

So I've been friends with Dan for a couple of years now. We grew pretty close in the last year or so, and he harbored a crush on me that I was oblivious to (looking back, I can certainly see it). I had a very close-knit group of friends in highschool and his actions due to the crush were very similar to what I was used to with them, like spontaneous movie nights, cooking dinner for one another, picking up small gifts that remind us of one another. It was a pretty average friendship for me and I did these things in return because I'm used to it and how I try to be a good friend to people.

Long story short, we dated a few weeks in the summer. The seriousness went up relatively fast, because I was in the middle of a move back to my hometown and needed a place to stay for a couple of weeks, and we were already close friends and skipped the normal ""getting to know you"" phase. I ended it because I was going to be back home, across the country, for six months during an internship. I also realized I wasn't ready for a serious commitment due to a long-term relationship that had ended earlier in the year. Since Dan had liked me so long, I didn't think it was fair to start something with him until I was completely emotionally ready. We talked about it, agreed to be friends, it was all fine. He knows I won't be ready for anything for a while. I think we ended it early enough that we could transition back into friendship pretty well, and we have, still messaging each other regularly. We agreed to be honest with one another if one of us started seeing someone else.

None of our friends knew about our relationship and we decided to keep it that way because we didn't want any awkward questions or expectations when I come back next year.

This weekend, him and a mutual friend, Sarah, were going to have a movie marathon at his place. This isn't abnormal, the three of us would do this regularly and him and I had a few ourselves just as friends. She's very comfortable with sharing a bed with friends and they'll usually sleep on separate sides, and have been in that habit for about a year, especially after a party when his couch is filled with other people. However, this ended up being a four-day binge with her staying the night all three nights and made me a little uncomfortable.

I asked him about it, he said it was platonic and he was enjoying having a friend with him since I've left. When her and I were talking she brought it up herself, and then asked me if Dan's always as sweet as he was to her this weekend since Dan and I had always been closer friends. The question crushed me a little, but they were the things I listed above like cooking dinner and picking up a small gift at the flea market (he also got me one), so I can't really be sure if it was a sign of feelings for her or just being a friend.

I'm trying to wrap it up, but since she didn't know about my relationship with Dan, she confided in me that she had some feelings there. She said she didn't have them before this weekend, that they cuddled a little by entwining their legs and sitting close, and how nice he was being made her realize she was attracted to him. Dan's reaction to everything is just ""I don't know,"" so I don't know how he feels about her.

After a lot of deliberation and discussion with Dan I told her about me and Dan's relationship. It was a really tough spot to be put in because on one hand, I didn't want her feelings to deepen and she finds out later and decide it's a problem. On the other, I don't want to feel like I was sabotaging their potential relationship. I minimized the depth of the relationship, just telling her we had seen each other for a few weeks and broke it off and decided to be friends. I decided that if she decided she wanted to pursue this, she could ask Dan for more information, but if it's a dealbreaker for her then she can go ahead and know the basic information. I also didn't want her to continue to confide in me and then find out, and feel betrayed or like my advice was biased.

I've backed out now because I think my involvement would just be me being selfish. I don't want my feelings there to affect their decisions regarding this. Tonight they're going to dinner to talk, and they've been gone for four hours. It's making me really anxious- I'm worried Sarah won't want to be friends with me anymore due to her emotions, I'm worried that they'll start dating and I'll need to take a step back from them, I'm worried that they won't date and Sarah will feel inadequate (she has an issue with feeling second choice or like she takes a backseat to others, which she shouldn't, she's gorgeous and wonderful). I'm also worried about Dan's decision making and whether it is a crush that developed because I'm unavailable or something, or if my return could cause a rift/problems in their relationship (which sounds terrible and self-centered but I've run through all the terrible possibilities in my head of how I could potentially lose them as friends)

I know I shouldn't feel this way. I'm the one that decided to break it off and just be friends. It's not my right to feel jealous or anxious, and if they do end up together, I truly want them to be happy and successful. In no way did I expect Dan to wait until I was ready. I just know I'll need some recovery time, which shouldn't be too hard since I'm not anywhere near them, but they are two of my best friends and my strongest connections with home.

I want to handle this well and with maturity, and let my emotions simmer down before returning in a couple of months. I've considered making a list of what I dislike about Dan and why we're better as friends but that just feels so aggressive and like I'm lying to myself. How can I be less anxious and get over this? How should I handle things from here on out? What do I do when I get back and see them in person (Dan and I are kind of the center of our friend group)? How should I react if they do end up dating? I don't have many close friends, so if I lose them I'll honestly be starting from scratch to make some new relationships that are just as strong as these.

Thank you for your help.
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: A close friend I was previously in a short relationship with (which I ended due to circumstances and we agreed to remain friends) and a mutual friend who has a crush on him are getting closer to each other and it's causing a lot of stress and anxiety on my part. I don't want them to make choices based on my feelings. How do I handle this with grace and retain the friendships best I can?"

I am currently a junior studying electrical engineering. I have been offered an internship position for Summer 2017 that would be in my field of study and would definitely help with my full-time career search that will begin in approximately a year. However, I have also been accepted to study abroad for next semester, which would go from about February through July and make it impossible to accept an internship position. I am extremely excited about both opportunities and it is making it very hard to choose. Which option seems like the right way to go in my position? I have always heard that having study abroad experience helps to differentiate one from another candidate when applying for a job. However, I feel that internship experience is vital to receiving a job after college. Any insight that would be help me to make up my mind would definitely be appreciated, thank you in advance!"

Is the courses at uofa going to equip me to be ready for the cs job market? Or would I have to teach myself the skills to code and be a competitive applicant? Should I consider taking the business or software specialization route? I worry that the courses will be too much theory and not enough practical application to get me prepared for a job in the cs field. Also is the science internship program difficult to get a position? I'd appreciate it if anyone could share their knowledge and make me more confident in making this decision.

*****
&gt; After reading through some two hundred Post editorials and op-eds about Sanders, I found a very basic disparity.

&gt; 2 For research purposes, I used the Nexis electronic search service to find all Washington Post stories mentioning Bernie Sanders and identified as &amp;quot;Editorial copy.&amp;quot; Judgments of what constituted &amp;quot;Negative&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Positive&amp;quot; were made by me and a Harper&amp;#039;s Magazine intern and were entirely subjective.

&gt; Sanders decried his &amp;quot;Lack of political realism&amp;quot; and noted with a certain amount of fury that Sanders had no plans for &amp;quot;Deficit reduction&amp;quot; or for dealing with Social Security spending-standard Post signifiers for seriousness.

&gt; Columnist after columnist and blogger after blogger offered judgments on how ridiculous, how very unjustified it was for Sanders to suggest Clinton wasn&amp;#039;t qualified for the presidency, and whether or not Clinton hadn&amp;#039;t started the whole thing first by implying Sanders wasn&amp;#039;t qualified, and whether she was right when she did or didn&amp;#039;t make that accusation.

&gt; In May, Milbank said he thought it was just awful the way frustrated Sanders supporters cursed and &amp;quot;Threw chairs&amp;quot; at the Nevada Democratic convention-and something close to treachery when Sanders failed to rebuke those supporters afterward.

&gt; Consider the circumstances in which Post pundits demanded that Sanders refrain from disparaging the Democratic National Committee.

I don't know if it was my long brown hair, my sparkling green eyes, or my banging body that made all the grown men crane their necks when I walked by. I'm sure my pencil skirts and tight dresses didn't help the situation either, but I rather enjoyed the attention.

I enjoyed the way you'd look at me when I brought by the lunch menu and you'd take 3 minutes deciding on your order. I could tell you were captivated by my aroma, the pleasing sent of florals and berries that I'd spray in my cubical before talking to you.

I'd also hike my skirt up another inch or so, knowing your wife, who smiled cheerfully from the picture frame on your desk, was powerless to stop it. I know you guys would talk about me in the kitchen when I wasn't around. I could only imagine what was being said because whenever I walked in, I could see you all straighten up and look at the ground. Maybe you talked about what color panties I was wearing that day, or if the boys at my school fucked me on a regular basis, or maybe you wondered if I ever took dirty pictures on my phone in the bathroom. Thinking about those things made me wet.

All the guys at the office were really nice to me, considering the fact that HR walked by my cubical about 10 times a day. There were plenty of hot young single men at my internship, but I took a liking to you best. There was something about you, something different. I didn't care at all that you were older and married, I still wanted to fuck you.

MONTREAL-TRAINED CONTEMPORARY CLOWN TO PERFORM IN TROY AT REVOLUTION HALL, OCT 26

Troy-based Aaron Marquise Aims to Change Perception of Clowns in One Man, One Night Only Performance of ""This is Not a Test""

TROY, N.Y. (10/19/16) -- A French clown living in Troy aims to change the perception of clowns with a one-person performance on Wednesday, Oct. 26 at Revolution Hall. 

*** (Read on to see how you can win free tickets plus a $50 gift card to Brown's) ***

""I'm not a birthday clown or a clown standing in a parking lot trying to scare you,"" said Aaron Marquise, a Montreal-trained contemporary French clown.  ""I focus more on the connection I can have with my audience and less on oversized props, colorful wigs, and balloon animals. When I can get a belly laugh out of 45-year-old man who has worked his entire life with his hands and has raised three kids, I know I've worked hard that night.""

Earlier this year, Marquise, established the region's only professional touring contemporary circus company, headquartered in Troy, N.Y. Marquise Productions has wowed audiences with three original circus shows in Troy's awesome Gas Holder building, a massive circular brick building that happens to resemble a French circus building. Though Marquise has performed as a clown before audiences in Montreal and Europe, he has only served as artistic director of the previous Troy circus productions, making this the first time for local audiences to see him in a performing role. ""This is Not a Test"" is Marquise's first solo production.

A mix between theater and a French-style of clowning, ""This is Not a Test"" is about an isolated clown who finds shelter in a desolate theater. With only inanimate objects as his friends, he attempts to live out the end of times, trapped between the music of yesterday and the disaster of tomorrow.

This show was created through an artist-in-residency program, provided by The Arts Center of the Capital Region and is sponsored by Brown's Brewing Company. The performance contains some mature content and runs approximately one hour with no intermission. Marquise says he aims to show the audience that clowning is an art form. He is not just going for laughs.

""I did not want to have a show that was just all jokes and only focused on laughter but also a show that had some heart and could challenge the audience to think,"" Marquise said. ""My clown is living alone in this sort of post apocalyptic war world, living on a stage in a theater but he's still hearing sounds of bombs dropping and planes flying overhead. He is very lonely.""

While the show does not make any direct connections to the current U.S. election season, audiences may infer some references.

""Some people are calling the presidential candidates 'clowns.' They are not clowns, they're all lunatics... except for wazisname,"" Marquise joked, having no particular political leanings of his own. It is scary, when you give someone that much power and at any moment they can press a button and start a world war. And that is where my show begins, after that button has been pressed by the lunatics in power.""

CREEPY CLOWNS VS FRENCH CLOWNS

Though ""creepy clowns"" are all over the news lately, Marquise said he’s not overly concerned about the negative effect they are having on the art form.

""The Creepy Clown thing is just a few people who are bored and decided to tap into a certain level of fear that already existed,"" Marquise said. ""I think it started as a joke and then there were copy-cats. But we also know that some people are inherently afraid of clowns because of the colors and their in-your-face attitude that doesn’t observe normal boundaries.""

Clowns rarely ever speak in their normal voice, Marquise said, noting that he himself either speaks in French or in English with a French accent, though he is a native anglophone.

""Because I studied as a clown in Montreal, the language there is French and a lot of my classes were in French so I picked up all these technical terms in French and I thought in French and had to communicate with my French-speaking audiences,"" said Marquise, who is a native of Round Lake, N.Y. ""Slowly my clown felt more comfortable talking in French or 'Franglais,' which is a made up word for when you combine French and English.""

Marquise said that there are several types of clowns including the contemporary French clown, American circus clown, and the Russian clown. While Russian clowns are typically clever and melancholic they are still very funny. The American circus clown uses more slapstick humor and large props that can be easily seen in arenas.  The contemporary French clown exists somewhere between those two styles, because they still use props and can have a sad cleverness, but the focus is on the relationship with the audience and less on the gag.

Though his is a decidedly French clown, Marquise draws inspiration from Charlie Chaplin, who was English, and other American clowns of the Depression era.

""Clowns put a mirror to society and say 'This is what we're dealing with at the moment,'"" Marquise said. ""Charlie Chaplin is a great example of that, where he's this tramp and shows how the other half lives. He is able to confront authority figures such as the cops and the bosses of the factory.""

Whether Chaplin was raising an orphan boy or mistakenly ruling a militaristic regime there was always heart inside the laughter, Marquise said, and that is the balance he is aiming for with his own production next week.

RELEVANT QUOTES ABOUT CLOWNS

""I remain just one thing, and one thing only, and that is a clown. It places me on a far higher plane than any politician"" -- Charlie Chaplin

""Nothing is funnier than unhappiness, I grant you that... Yes, yes, it's the most comical thing in the world. And we laugh, we laugh, with a will, in the beginning. But it's always the same thing. Yes, it's like the funny story we have heard too often, we still find it funny, but we don't laugh any more."" -- Samuel Beckett, Endgame

58i5ri,14,2016-10-20,"Me (22F) has absolutely had it with my crazy abusive ex (22F) because the crazy doesn't STOP, it's been 4 years",throwawaycrazyex5656,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/58i5ri/me_22f_has_absolutely_had_it_with_my_crazy/,"I'm at my wits end guys. I'm going to keep this as short as possible because it would take a book to tell the entire thing. I dated a girl in the same program as me in first year university (I was 17 at the time). We had the same group of friends which was awesome cause we could all hang out together. We were quickly infatuated with each other I guess because we were each other's first homosexual relationship (I'm bisexual if this matters). The relationship was great in the beginning but quickly began to die out as we were VERY different. She was extremely religious whereas I was extremely Atheist. We dated for about 10 months, with 4 months of long distance in between. That's where things started to go extremely downhill. 


I was on a summer internship overseas so we had an insane time difference of 14 hours or something like that. It made communicating very difficult obviously. She began to get upset at me if I went out to explore this new city I was in and didn't skype her as often as she wanted. This escalated into her breaking up with me weekly... then daily. I eventually realize that I am starting to lose feelings for this girl, and during a period where we were broken up (again), I had met somebody and went on a few dates with. I ended up feeling so guilty I ended things with him and got back together with this girl (again). However, not much longer later I could not handle the guilt of me 'cheating' and I ended things with her saying that I didn't want a relationship anymore and that I had lost feelings.


This is when the crazy began. After me breaking up with her she constantly harassed me with angry text messages, phonecalls, and her harassing our mutual friends about me. She kept wanting to get back together and asked me countless times. I ended up telling her about the guy I went on a few dates with, and ofcourse she got really angry that I 'cheated' on her. This is when the abuse escalated into her screaming at me whenever we met up in person to talk, refusing to leave, and throwing a tantrum when I asked her to leave. She tried to aggressively seduce me a few times, and things got so bad to the point where she began to self harm and blame it on me. I knew things needed to end once she threatened to kill herself if I didn't get back together with her. I eventually cut her off entirely but I still had to see her since we were in the same program and had many classes together.


Fast forward, about 6 months later I receive a snapchat from her and  its a picture of her and my previous ex telling me to fuck myself. Obviously I didn't take offense to this because she's crazy, but it was also a psychotic thing to do since she doesn't know my previous ex (so did she meet up with him just to send me an aggressive snapchat?). Also she knew how badly my previous ex had hurt me, so this was a SUPER low blow. Anyway after this incident I was on a year long work term in a different state so I didn't see her, out of sight out of mind.


Things were great when she wasn't around and only started getting bad once I returned to school. Seeing her is still a huge trigger for me because of all the abuse (won't get into details it's really long). However, when we initially broke up she told all our mutual friends that I had cheated on her then dumped her, and most of them sided with her. I told them my side of the story but they all seemed to take her side cause she was the 'victim'. Whatever, I don't really need friends like them so I didn't really care. However, one of my really good friends ended up being her roommate last year AND this year and its making friend gatherings really awkward. My friend knows the gist of what happened but I told him only a short sugar coated version of her abuse because I felt bad telling him things that made his roommate look bad. Also, I was afraid to out her because she was REALLY closeted when we first started dating. 

Fast forward to this summer. After my relationship with my crazy ex I started dating this amazing girl for about 2 years but we broke up early this summer amicably, and we've remained very close friends. Coincidentally, crazy ex and amicable ex were at the same music festival in August and had ran into each other. This is going to sound crazy but amicable ex told me that crazy ex had asked her for a photo about 1 minute into meeting each other. They both knew who each other were and my amicable ex thought it was really weird that she insisted on taking a photo with her and had told me right away (they had never met each other prior to this). This really freaked me out as I thought she had finally put it behind her since it's been nearly 4 years since we dated. 


I need advice guys! She's making my life very difficult because she is in ALL of my classes and I feel like my social life is suffering because I avoid her a lot (which leads to me avoiding some of my friends/acquaintances too cause they all hang out with her). Seeing her is still a trigger because I constantly have to look at the face of my abuser everyday and pretend to be amicable with her. In front of other people she acts completely sane when deep down I know all the terrible shit she's done to me. I'm tired of seeing her and I'm tired of going out of my way to avoid her. What can I do to improve my situation? Thank you everyone who read the whole thing!


TL;DR: My crazy and abusive ex from 4 years ago makes me really uncomfortable and I have to see her everyday for the past 2 years and I'm at my wits end.

I've constantly fought feelings of self-loathing, loneliness, and the fear of losing those who call me their friend.

So when I hit college I met what can only be described as the best thing to ever happen to me (we'll call her Sally). Sally was that one person who saw through all the bull-shit I put up, she was always there for me, supportive of me, always pushed me to try to be better than who I was. Sally can only be described as my best friend in the whole world' someone that has your back no matter what. But I ignored her. In my stubborn self-harming ways, I pushed Sally way when she wanted to get closer, I would ignore all of her advice (no matter how on the dot it may have been) because the fear of facing the fact that I wasn't happy with my life was too great.

This isn't to say I didn't care for Sally, I would always be there for her no matter what and I was always the rock she would come to when something was wrong. I loved her, I just didn't love myself.

My personal monsters rampaged me for the better part of the last 3 months of our now senior year. I was reclusive, combative, uncaring; all kinds of awful things to this girl who loved me and simply wanted me to show it back. I was so afraid of all these uncertainties in my future that I dove as deep as I could into things that could distract me form the future that was slowly creeping up. We'd talked recently about the whole post-college thing and so my fears of being alone, her moving on and finding someone new were stuck in the back of my mind like a needle I couldn't pull out.

For the record I'd told Sally about some of these problems and I think she justifiably hurt by them. The fact that I still had doubts about her feelings and commitments really hurt her and there was nothing I could do about it at the time.

So after my 3 month fear/sadness binge Sally and I decided it was enough, this wasn't healthy for either of us and we needed to break up (particularly for me to work on myself). 

So it's been a couple of days since we broke up and I'm finally seeing answers to all these questions that had plagued me, I'm finally seeing growth and happiness where I never saw it before. I'm more in touch with why I loathed myself so much and why I would feel so alone, even in a crowd of people. I'm applying for internships and programs that I wouldn't have touched months ago, and I'm keeping a journal to make sure that if I'm ever feeling scared or down on myself, that I have somewhere to record my feelings so I can learn to better combat my negative emotions. It's certainly not the end of a journey of self-discovery, but its the progress I so desperately needed months ago.

Me and Sally had talked about it and we determined that if things got better, we could see getting back together. IF I was able to prove to her that I had really changed for the better, that I wasn't the person who pushed her away just weeks before. She's my best friend in the whole world and I can't imagine not trying to make things work again especially if I come into the relationship refreshed with a new perspective. 

So Reddit I come to ask you, am I being to early in deciding I would want to try again, and should I even give it another shot.

Do you think I have time show her I changed before she moves on? Thanks in advance if you read this far, I appreciate it

I don't post on here much, but I have been a follower for many months now, and have had immense reassurance and comfort from this sub, so thank you! I just wanted to share my story and excitement with you all(: 

We met on Tinder back in 2013, lost communication for a year, then EXACTLY one year later reunited on Tinder again! At that point we knew it was destiny. We started dating, and six months into our relationship, he graduated college, got an amazing offer in California, and moved. I  We talked about breaking up, but realized that the breakup would be much harder than the LDR, so we took the chance. I was going to stay and finish up my three final years of college in Colorado, but he told me that he wasn't sure if he could handle the pain of doing LDR for that long, and honestly, neither was I. There wasn't any reason for me not to move and find a school out there. I agreed. He offered to have me move in with him a few months later, and I said hell yeah haha. We've seen each other once every six or seven weeks for the past two years. An opportunity presented itself on my end to move out to him. I'm going to be able to graduate college sooner there than here in Colorado, land an excellent internship, AND live with him. 

Needles to say, we both can't wait for the next 10 weeks to fly by.  We both want so badly to start our lives together, and I can't wait to graduate and end up being the best power couple our friends and family have known.

I told myself I would never met someone online. I also told myself I would never do an LDR, and I never even imagined moving in with a boyfriend before engagement. But, he defied all my odds and philosophies, and has shown what a true gentleman can be. We just celebrated our two year anniversary too.   He never pictured himself finding a girlfriend at all. We are each other's both first SERIOUS relationship. Of course, there's been doubts, but there's always be a high amount of reassurance that we are right for each other, and that we are meant to be in each other's lives. 


Thank you, fellow Redditors! I wish you all the best of luck in your LDRs, and hope that you too get to enjoy the excitement of closing the gap one day. "

I've never been to Ibiza before, let alone such a lush holiday home: there's a pool, a jacuzzi, a home cinema, a wine cellar and even a private beach belongs to the property. And the best part is: I'm here with three beautiful women.   
   
   
   
   
No, Im not a rich celebrity. I wish I was. In fact, the trip was the first prize in a popular TV quiz-show: 2 weeks in a remote finca on Ibiza for the winner and three companions – all expenses paid.   
But I'm not even the winner of that show. I am one of the lucky companions who were asked to join. In fact, the lucky winner is you.  
We've been close friends since high-school and although you're very pretty, our relationship has always been platonic. Since we're going to different colleges, we don't see each other so often. Needless to say, I didn't think twice when you asked me to go with you.   
The two other companions are Alexa and Jenna, your two best friends. You've met in college. Alexa is 19 years old. Slim and curvy, big boobs, blonde hair, blue eyes, beautiful. Jenna, 22,  is a petite girl with dark hair and brown eyes, small b-cups and a firm ass. You've told me that Jenna just started an internship as a chemist at a big pharmaceutical company. „She's really really smart, but also a little crazy“, you said. You had no idea how right you were about that...
***
Fast forward to today: Here I am, taking my sunbath by the pool and enjoying a Tequila sunrise. What I don't know yet, is that Jenna spiked my drink with a expiremental drug that she must have snitched from the lab where she works. The drug with the product name „HGQ-12“ will boost male libido, cause long lasting erections, increase sperm volume and even allow men to have multiple orgasms. Suspected side effects are premature and sometimes spontaneous ejaculation. Obviously Jenna didn't want to wait for the approval for tests on humans, so she figured she might just do her own little experiment...

Hey, thanks for reading! In this RP I'd love to play your male friend Jake, who's (at first) **really** embarrassed and confused by the fact, that he has a boner almost all the time or that even a casual touch can be enough to make him cum. Once you notice what's going on, the three of you start teasing me on purpose – just to mock me a little bit.   
I'd love to imagine that eventually, the girls realize that they might have gone a little bit to far. To make amends for making fun of me and help me to release some sexual energy, they finally allow me to fuck them whenever I want. Hey, that's jst fair!   
I'm looking for a RP-partner who'd like to play with me on a mid/longterm basis.  I'd love to include a reasonable amount of **buildup** for this RP. This specific prompt would more or less focus on sexual tension in the finca building up. Eventually, of course, it would break down into a full-blown house of sex between the four of them, but that's later on!     
  
  
  
  
Hope to hear from you :)   
Jake.

My manager pressured me to keep working one shift a week (which I know she did cause she was short on people) and since I was nervous about the new job, I decided to. It was really hard, and I was working 45 hours a week at my desk job, and one morning shift a week, and I was completely exhausted.

I figured I was going to quit Starbucks, but after a few major things happened at work, I realized that that wasn't the problem at all. It turns out, my boss at my desk job was completely insane, and a verbally abusive employer. On the one hand, the job was in the field I went to school for, and looked great on a resume. On the other hand, I was crying at work every. single. day.

I let my manager know I was quitting my other job, and told her a few of the reasons why, and she was a total rockstar. The week I finally gave in and quit, I walked into Starbucks and had 30 hours scheduled. 

This job drives me crazy sometimes, but at least the people I'm working with are looking out for me. I'm still super green and prone to messing up, but being able to go from a job that was giving me nightmares, to being able to make enough money to stay on my feet while I look for something new?

One of them in chemical engineering and the other in a corporate rotational program. I'm very divided as to which path to follow. I found myself regretting having wasted the past five years of my life without realizing that eventually I would have to actually pursue my studies as a profession, I merely wanted to prove to myself I could hack it and understand the physical realities of the world to better hone my intuitions. I also figured the salary from the career would allow me to pursue my own passions. I am starting to realize, however, how daunting a career in this field will be.

58jqvo,0,2016-10-20,My boyfriend [27 M] of 7 years is ignoring me [27 F] after I sent him an angry emails a few days ago.,OhWellIdontknow,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/58jqvo/my_boyfriend_27_m_of_7_years_is_ignoring_me_27_f/,"I have been in a relationship with my boyfriend for seven years. We have lived many years together, but since September I am doing an internship 6h away from him, and we have been doing long distance for a month and a half.

We have had some communication/relationship issues in the past (nothing too crazy, I think it happens to everyone), and we always talked about it calmly, sitting down, expressing our emotions, listening to each other.

My boyfriend has a big passion, and spend a lot of time talking about it, and doing it. I am very happy he has such a deep passion in his life, and while I am not as interested as he his, I will gladly listen to him talking about it.

This Saturday evening, we were on the phone, and he was telling me that he was planning to go for a week on holidays to pursue his passion in a different context. That made me sad, because I wish he would come over Thanksgiving so we could spend some time together. (I would have understood that he would not come the whole week as I have to work and there is not much to do, but I was expecting maybe a long WE or something). Anyway. I tell him, he argues that it really is a big passion to him, we change the subject, but I was annoyed (even though I was trying to hide that from the tone of my voice).

Then, a few minutes after, we were talking about something else (I forgot the context), he makes a passive/agressive remark, and there I just can't take it anymore and I just hang up and shut my phone off. I was kind of pissed because he was making over the course of the conversation many small criticisms, and I got suddenly tired of it.

For some reason, I was very emotional, I felt he did not really want to put much effort in trying to see me, and I had a lot of other things that I was angry about, so I took my laptop, and made a list of all the things that he was doing and that I didn't like, explain each point with a few examples, and send that email to him. I said in the email that I realised I was emotional, and it was certainly exaggerated and biased, but many issues I was raising were not new, we had already talked about it, he was still doing that behaviour, so maybe telling him all of this in his ""fucking face"" would shake him a bit. I told him he was welcome to send me a similar email if he also had things to say. 

Well. He hasn't sent a single message/email/word to me since then. Now, I do realise that he might be offended, or sad that I have such a view of him (or maybe he thinks I'm right and he is questioning himself), but I would have expected an answer. The next day, I sent him a text, suggesting that we should talk on the phone. The following days as well. I just can see that he had read the message, but that's it. Yesterday, I sent another email, telling him that I wanted to talk, that I understood that he could be angry, but that we had to have a discussion. I also said I was ready to drive to his place this WE so we could have the discussion face to face rather than over the phone, but I asked him to answer something, at least. I said that I was suffering from his silence.

I don't know what to do. If he needs to think about our relationship, I am ok leaving him some space, but I wish he would just tell me ""I need some time"". Here I just get ignored, and I feel really bad about it. I agree that I was at fault to send an angry email, but I feel we should be adults and discuss about our issues. The silence is really unnerving. If anyone has some bits of advice on how to proceed, please let me know. Should I keep sending messages, or should I wait for him to contact me? Should I just drive on Friday night to his place?

58k0lw,1,2016-10-20,How many Interns should I hire.,LBgeckos,socialmedia,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/58k0lw/how_many_interns_should_i_hire/,"Hey guys, I have the option to hire 1 intern or a group of 3 interns (from a school) 

I don't know if I'll have enough work for 3 interns but it might be a bit much for 1. I could really use some advice here from anyone that has worked with interns before. 


Essentially I have my base content all ready to go and then need to have interns curate content as it happens. I also need them to schedule, scrape content, provide event day coverage and update my weekly reports.

The tricky thing is it is a 3 stop event in 3 different countries so I need to do that for all of these events. The base level is set and solid but I really want to go above and beyond this year. 

How much can a college intern handle? is this asking too much of 1? 

Any help is super duper appreciated. 

Thanks!

58kcrq,41,2016-10-20,Can I vent?,chickspartan,blackladies,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/58kcrq/can_i_vent/,"Thanks for listening to this stranger get some things off her chest.

I walked out of my dream job job today. After 2 years of trying to get an event planning career off the ground, I'm ready to throw in the towel.

Some background: My dad's first words to me after I got the call were ""Please pray this one works out."" See, since graduation college 3.5 years ago, the longest I've held down a job has been 10 months. The shortest has been 3 weeks. The catering job was my 7th after a long line of failure. 

I was SO GOOD at school. Straight A's, internships, president of student organizations, full ride scholarship, the whole shebang. But that didn't translate to the real world. I don't ""wow"" people anymore, my work always feels subpar, and people aren't excited to work with me. An analogy I've used is feeling like I prepared to be a chess champion in a world set up for checkers.

But this job was supposed to be different. I was finally in ""my field"", so none of the same issues should follow me. I try to remain cautiously optimistic, bonding with my manager (a fellow ambitious woman of color). I tell her my husband and I are getting ready to buy a house, that now that I've got such a good job we can finally start serious discussions about kids. I walked in and out of the office on Cloud 9 every day. 

But my manager seemed to go from loving me to hating me all in the course of one mistake. I wrote down a customer's credit card number incorrectly. The problem was easily fixed, but from then on my boss was cold, distant, and distrustful. I walked on eggshells and tried to be 100% accurate, but inevitably with a new company (and no training), I would make little slip ups here and there. Forget how this client likes their receipts, not forward feedback from an event to a department manager, ring up water for $4.99 instead of $5.99- nothing extreme. I was always on time, polite, loved our clients, always ready to help out whenever I could. My boss grows ever more frustrated and I try my best to smile and not take it personally. I figure my boss is just stressed. But when I sat down for my 60 Day Review, which my boss knew I was nervous as hell about, I'm blindsided when my director tells me I'm not catching on quickly enough and that every time I make a mistake my boss forwards him the mistake. He's considering eliminating my position. I'm like a deer in the headlights. Besides my boss's attitude, I was never formally corrected or told outright that she was so frustrated she was taking it to The Boss. I'm incredibly angry, but use this experience to fuel my fight. I have 30 days to turn things around.

I come up with a 2-year plan for how I want to progress in the position and increase sales. There are charts, timelines, performance evaluations, job shadowing, certifications, the whole 9 yards. I take into account their feedback and come up with a plan to improve. I'm prepared to fight for this job like I never have before. I want so desperately to experience ""wow""-ing someone again. I think this Action Plan is the way to do it. My boss doesn't have time to look at it. The Boss looks at the first page before putting it away. 

My boss goes on vacation for 9 days and I take over for her, coming in every day of the week to take care of our clients. I love every second of it. On the side I'm building rapport with other people in the company, getting advice from anyone and everyone who will give it to me, and reading up on how to be a stellar employee. The first day my boss is back she calls a meeting with The Boss again, ready to lay out more mistakes I've apparently made. Someone else on our team (who I highly suspect is having an affair with my boss) also messaged him detailing my failures without ever speaking to me about it. I'm trying to explain myself on the spot but not doing a very good job. I become emotional and start to cry, feeling sabotaged. Why would my boss do this to me in such a sneaky way? Especially when she knows I want to start a family? It feels like one of the cruelest things anyone has done to me. Beyond hurt, embarrassed, and frustrated, I say I would like to move to a different part of the company because I feel the working relationship between my team and I has been irrevocably damaged. My manager thanks me for my bravery and honesty, The Boss says everything will be ok and we'll find a solution for everyone.

I go into work today excited to hear about what I'll be doing. We had discussed me training to become a beer specialist and I'm prepared to really try and make that work. Instead, I'm told I'm going to help push sales. By doing demo's. As in, standing in the back of the store with some pork chops asking people if they want free samples. For 40 hours. Every week. I go to The Boss and timidly explain that I have a degree, have worked in the Olympics, at City Hall... is there perhaps a more dynamic way to use my talents? He tells me he sees why my manager had a problem with me, that if he tells me to do something I am to do it, that he has 608 employees to think about and I'm becoming such a problem he'd rather be done with me, that I think I'm above this work. I tell him if he wants me to do this I'll do it and I'll do it well. I set up a really pretty display and try and sell the product, but inevitably I end up just standing around for several hours. My old coworkers walk by me with pity. My old boss continues to do the job that I loved, running around me in circles while I fill plastic cups with chunks of meat. I'm so humiliated I walk out. A friend who used to work at the company confirms what I had feared, they put me on the ""make her quit"" path so they didn't have to pay out unemployment from firing me.
 Let me be the first to admit that I am extremely privileged. My husband has a great job and can support us on his income if it takes me a while to find something. I don't believe I'll have trouble finding a little low stress administrative job for 30 hours or so a week, which is what I've resigned myself to doing. Now that I don't have such a demanding career with weird hours I can focus on my family. But here I am again. More bridges burned, more missed opportunities, failed attempts at glory. Everyone around me seems to be able to kick start their career, what's wrong with me?

Thanks for listening."

58l7td,2,2016-10-20,I [19M] have been dating my girlfriend [18F] for over a year but feel like it might be better for me to break up with her. Help,relationshipthrow619,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/58l7td/i_19m_have_been_dating_my_girlfriend_18f_for_over/,"Okay so basically I have been dating this girl for a year and almost 3 months and we are super close. I am in college in a different state she is finishing up her last year of high school. We have discussed plans of her coming up and going to a community college about 30 minutes from my college and possibly living together in an apartment. Some backstory she has cheated on me twice and I forgave her and gave her another chan but we were on pretty shake ground the only thing keeping us together was the fact that we saw each other so often and I sorta suppressed the memory of the pain to try to move on now it rarely bothers me and trust is starting to build up again but nowhere on the level where it should be. I have 3 main issues with our relationship now. One I still feel somewhat of a lack of trust because she has cheated. I think sometimes what if she does it again when I am married? How could i possibly have children with someone who did this to me? Sometimes I even feel hate for how she made me feel even though she has apologized and shown new ways. Two she set this ridiculous rule for me that I can't be friends with ANY girls in college or even talk to them or text them or snapchat / share social media. She is super paranoid and this is unfair because a lot of the girls on my dorm floor are pretty cool and I have NEVER cheated on her or even come close to it physically or emotionally. Sure theres a few attractive girls but I mostly think of them all as guy friends who happen to be girls nothing more nothing less. So I decided to break that promise and I became friends with them and exchanged social media and basically just did friend stuff only with other guys around though. My girlfriend drove up to visit me and found out and was very pissed and I know it was wrong but she is acting like I cheated and its a bit of an overreaction. I understand she is hurt from me lying but I think she set an unrealistic expectation that I never should have agreed to. Third issue is that I feel much more mature and responsible than her. In the last year she has progressed from B grades to D grades and then from D grades to not showing up to class to online school to not even doing her online school. She has a pretty decent paid internship that she never misses out on and has that going on for her. She also has very little discipline by never working out and eating unhealthy even though she is very skinny and attractive to me I find the lack of discipline unattractive. I might not be perfect but I try to be healthy and I get my work done especially with school and I am now in a top 50 college so it has paid off. I find it hard to think about a future with someone who can't even attend classes. She says she gets bad anxiety in school which I understand but then she needs to find a solution either learning to cope with the anxiety or online classes that she actually completes. At this point I think it is best if I break things off with her because I love her and the sex is pretty good and part of me wants to be with her forever but I feel like another part of me doesn't want to. I feel like she can only bring me down with her bad habits and irresponsibility and immaturity and those are all unattractive qualities. Also I kind of have trust issues now and I feel the need to compulsively check her phone because that was how I found out about the cheating. Also she has said that if I want to be friends with girls I should just break up with her and not lead her on. I feel like the best thing for me is to break it off because I also don't have a lot of experience with girls and I feel like it is important to know what other relationships are like. She was my third kiss, second relationship but first serious one, and I lost my virginity to her. I feel like there are so many other girls that could work better or worse for me and I will learn more about myself by trying new things. She seems like the perfect girl in some ways we get along really well, have similar interests, we have so much fun together, we have very similar backgrounds but I find it hardest to get past the cheating in the past because if it were the laziness and immaturity alone I would try to help and her lack of trust in me to be friends with other girls doesn't help. Like I said I feel like I should break it off with her and be single for a bit and maybe come back to her if we both decide it is right in 6 months to a year but for some reason the thought of being away from her is literally TERRIFYING. Were doing long distance obviously so its not the physical part but she is the only person I text all day every day. Family and friends are a few times a week. I text her like a friend and love her like a girlfriend and I do love her which is partly why I am scared. The thought of her experimenting with other types of guys makes me feel sick to the stomach even though I think that it might be good for me to experiment with other girls. I am also scared that I might not be able to find other girls even though I definitely can if I have done it in the past. I feel stuck in this situation and haven't felt 100% blissfully in love since before the cheating happened. I have had a few occasions where I have come close to breaking up with her but then said. Maybe I should push it off for a few weeks to ease her into it and hurt her less and then I fall right back into the swing of things and forget about the plan. I just feel like I need SOMETHING to force me to break it off and ANYTHING to distract me from the pain that will come. I wish I could hit a pause button, delete my feelings and try new things and then come back to her if I deem it for the best and bring my feelings back without the pain. I don't know where else to go for help on this because my friends in college don't know me or her well enough to give good advice and I'm honestly embarrassed to fully open up about this which is why I am doing it ""anonymously"" on here. I do not have that type of relationship with my family we never talk about girl problems. I don't know where to turn and I feel like I am stuck in life right now (with the girl situation everything else is going great) and I don't know which direction to go which decision to make and if I don't act fast I will keep sinking into the mud. Please help reddit. 

  **tl;dr**: Not sure if I should end things with my girlfriend of a year and 3 months. What is the right decision what is the wrong decision? Damned if I do ya damned if I don't. "
58ljv0,2,2016-10-21,"I'm sorta a disappointment, but I'm also sorta okay with it.",notsobadsad,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/58ljv0/im_sorta_a_disappointment_but_im_also_sorta_okay/,"When I was a kid, I was always told, ""Oh you're so smart, you're gonna be blah blah blah."" By teachers, my parents, family, you know. I was good at history, and I guess articulate for a kid. That was about it though. I was lazy as fuck, and it bit me in the ass my freshman year of college. I got my shit together (mostly) and transferred to community college. I'm studying now to become a teacher, and my grades are fine and I'm content. I can see the disappointment though, when I talk to people. I was always in AP classes and shit and half of my closest friends got into ivy leagues. It's not that I don't care what other people think, because I do, especially my friends... but at the same time, it feels nice to not have some weird burden of expectation. So sorry Mom and Dad, I know that when you sent me off two years and two months ago, you were nothing but excited and hopeful and supportive. But I'm not going to have a high paying job and a fancy degree.

I'm also not a romantic like...at all. I went on my first first date two months ago at age 20. It was so easy to talk to her and for the first time I found myself enjoying talking to a woman with the clear intent of asking her out. Well in a cosmic conspiracy of events, the day before the date my regular stylist performed a stunning hack job and my hair was laughable. In addition, some idiot dinged my car when I went to go pick her up, and my mother decided to throw a tantrum at me over something or other so I was in a piss poor mood and ruined it. Sorry Sarah, I know you were looking forward to that date. I don't blame you for not wanting to go on a second.

I downloaded Tinder that night, and amazingly got a match and a month later (I masterfully stalled while my hair grew out and it hid the follicle massacre) I went on the second first date of my life. That one went much better, but it still wasn't enough. I'll be honest Amanda, it hurt a little when you said maybe it's best if we don't exchange numbers.

Back to the friends thing... I don't really have any anymore. All my friends (literally every single one) got the fuck out of this hick town. I'm happy for all of them, I really am. Back in high school they were the greatest friends an extroverted introvert like me could've asked for. But when they come home and I hear that my friend landed a paid internship with NASA, or that they're getting a free ride at an ivy league because some tech company wants to hire them... I feel a little small. Yeah there are people who I work and volunteer and go to school with that I don't mind. But they're all either too old and have careers or too young and are soon going to be going off to college themselves. I'm sorry I can't make it like you guys can, I know it's a little painful to hear my stories when you have so much going on.

The only person I talk to regularly is my friend who from out of state, and even she doesn't really like talking to me. I can tell. The way she's dismissive, borderline condescending. But I can deal with that because we'll talk about Steven Universe or Psych or whatever. I'm sorry I'm not very entertaining Kate. I know I'm your only friend, too. 

But at the same time... I'm not unhappy. I have acquaintances that are good for a laugh at work or make cold calling for a congressional candidate palatable. My part time job is actually perfect for my schedule and financial needs at the present moment. I love my pets and have time to myself. I can't stand my family, but why else do rooms have doors? I've taken to cooking, which is actually very fun. Things are.. okay. 

Anyways, this got long. Stuff has been accumulating inside my mind for a while. Normally this is something I'd dump on my best friend, but I don't want to burden them. I mean it's been two years since we've hung out. I want to say he's my best friend, but is he? Who knows. For now, it's all good. It'll probably get better? I dunno. Just needed to type things out."

There are a lot of pros and cons to both. However I need to make the best choice for myself. 

A little background on myself, I'm graduating in December with a BS in accounting and I am located in the OC LA area. I currently work at a CPA firm (as a part time intern which I have been doing for 9 months. I have entertained the idea of staying put and working full time at my firm as I study for and pass the CPA exam. (Planning to sit for the first part in April) however I just don't see myself staying there long term and I wanna move to a firm that is at least a little bigger and where I would have a bigger role. With that being said I haven't had much luck with any of the CPA firms that I've talked to. Despite having good experience and okay grades I've only managed one interview with a firm as a full time intern. Albeit I really just started looking in the past few weeks or so. On the other hand I see a lot of corporate accounting positions available with very good starting pay and have interviews for two different ones coming up. My preference at this point is to hopefully land a full-time position at a CPA firm with a good starting pay where I can work at while I get my CPA license. However if the right opportunity doesn't come along I am not opposed to getting a corporate job at a company that I like but then I just feel like there's almost no point to going for the CPA. I know the logical path is to start in public and move to corporate but I would love to hear anyone's own personal experience or opinion, thanks."

I'm a 27 yo female dating a 27 yo male. for almost 2 months. He's a resident at the hospital where I also work. We met throughout an online dating app before beginning to work together. He recently moved here for an intern year and will be moving to complete his residency when finished in app. 9 months. He said upfront he wasn't looking for anything serious but really liked me. We've been on about 10 dates- a mix of both nights on the town and chilling at home. He is always the one to initiate texts and hanging out. We don't talk everyday day but I would estimate 5/7 days per week. He's rocketing the cocky funny attitude and isn't quick to reveal emotions but I think we've got a real connection and have great chemistry. We talk about philosophy, politics, religion and other philosophical ideals. We share a sense of humor and connect on both being passionate working in the same field. He's eager to hangout and get to know me. Although I had told him I don't have sex outside of relationships, I acted out of my norm and slept with him after 10 dates. I don't regret it but am weary of what that means going forward. 

My question is what should I do going forward. He's acting like someone interested in being my boyfriend but has explicitly  stated he's not looking for a relationship. I know it would be foolish to try and change his mind but I also recognize that men are human too and are susceptible to developing feelings. It's often said women look for love and find sex and men look for sex and find love. 

Should I continue to hangout with him and see where things go (although remaining guarded)? I've made my expectations known and he's aware I'm looking for a relationship. Is there a chance he is developing real feelings as well? Mind you it is fairly early on. OR...

Should I heed the warning provided and walk away if he is not willing to define the relationship or agree to exclusivity?

The rules of dating in today's hookup culture are so unknown. It is so common for hookups and casual dating today. Even those interested in a relationship are quick to play it cool and casual at the beginning. Please let me know how to proceed so that I can avoid setting myself up for inevitable hurt while also being open to the possibility of love? Can a man not looking for a relationship develop feelings for someone and change his mind?"

I'm 23, A junior at University, working on my undergraduate in Accounting. However, I have never been in this situation before... I think I'm depressed. Let me list off what has happened over the past 6 months.

Girlfriend of two years who is a 9/10 graduates and starts Law School, she immediately breaks up with me months before this fall semester started. (same woman who said she wants to marry me) 
sex was insane; she would do whatever I wanted. She has now completely ghosted me.

Shoulder injury about two months ago has prevented me from going to the gym, Im 5'8"" and was 160, now I'm just above 150 because I have not been to the gym... this is causing me some depression I believe

My sleep schedule is so bad, I cant fall asleep before 4am and it is affecting my life severely. I tend to get very emotional at night as well. Makes waking up at 7am for my internship difficult.

As of late I have started eating like crap because I dont care, but I used to care a lot and cook meals 5 days out of the week.

My grades have started to slip as well, The best I can do this semester is all B's... I usually get 3 A's and 1 B

My finances are fucked... I work 3 days at a Restaurant making decent tips and I have no money because rent and living expenses are high and my car is a piece of crap that is costing me money in repairs. 

This is embarrassing, but I cant stop masturbating... like literally twice a day, every day, and it screws up what little time I have. 

The worst part is, Its all starting to add up and the stress and depression im feeling is causing me to give up. TRP, I have never posted anything, but I could use some advice on how to get out of this and back towards the goal and career oriented, good sex life, life I desire.

Indecent Proposal - one of my favourites, all the details are here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3wyd43/34m4f_the_indecent_proposal/ - also I've combined this with the office roleplay in the past to some success so I would be interested in exploring this more, such as *the intern gets a special offer *staff member needs to make a deal to save their job

Office Muck Up - this worked out well, all details here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3sfmkc/33m4f_office_mistake/

The Guitarist/Backing Dancer - In this one I'm backing you up, either your guitarist or one of your dancers. On this tour, there's a section of the show where you are basically singing on me, wrapped around me, dancing sexily in front of me. As the tour progressed we're getting hotter and hotter until the last night of the tour I whisper in your ear as you finish ""I want to fuck you tonight"" before carrying on with my job. This obviously lends itself to celeb play.

Escort Roleplay - I've had some great roleplays with this scenario - you are an escort and I'm your client. You can play anyone from a street hooker to a high class/exclusive/celebrity escort. I've also been exploring an 'Old West Brothel' RP - you'd play a girl working in a brothel above an Old West bar, your clients could be the sheriff, the mayor, an outlaw?

Stalker - I've been following you for a while, and watching you. That's the basic premise but we can work out the exact details. This could be quite a dark RP if we both wanted it to be that way. Do you know I'm watching? Are you enjoying it? Do I break in one night?

Damsel in distress - I have a log cabin in a remote mountain range. You get stuck on my doorstep after getting lost and racing to shelter from a snow storm. You have no choice but to spend the weekend with me, which isn't a bad prospect on first impressions as I'm a typical romantic novel woodsman - strong, sexy, fit etc.
A gym affair - I run a gym, you are a member. We're both married, but we are both crazy about each other. Ultimately this will end up with us in the gym after hours making use of all the equipment. Actually, I'd pretty much consider any roleplay that involves sex in the gym - sexy ladies in gymwear are a thing for me

Celeb Play - I absolutely love celeb roleplay and if my writing partner fully commits to the character, it can be amazing. Really open to anything with this one.

Unless you want to play yourself, or if we're doing celeb roleplay, I usually like the women in my RP to be picked from one of the following subs - AthleticGirls Hardbodies TrashyBoners FestivalSluts"

58noal,4,2016-10-21,Does it sound like my ex is a narcissist?,TN9311,NarcissisticAbuse,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/58noal/does_it_sound_like_my_ex_is_a_narcissist/,"Met my now ex boyfriend 2 years ago. Our connection felt amazing, seemed to line up on some many important things in life, never loved someone as much as I loved him. It was an amazing feeling. I am 24, he is 29.

If I ever brought up a serious topic or if I ever caught him lying about something stupid, he would get defensive, blow up on me, then break up saying we would never get back together. Always came back a day or two later apologetic and wanting me back.

My parents started picking up on this cycle. My ex was an intern at my dad's office, and it started getting really tense between the two of them. My ex ended up being offered a full time position to begin this fall at his office.

Ex broke up again with me at the beginning of the summer, dad was furious and sent him a text saying ""I don't like the way you're treating her. We already have to work together, please don't make this any worse."" Ex originally was furious my dad had texted him, then like always wanted me back a few days later. I told him this time we were going to sit down with my parents before we got back together to settle this once and for all.

So that evening started out fine. Small talk, ate dinner, everyone was getting along. When I brought our relationship up, my ex BLEW UP on me and my parents out of nowhere. Was accusing me of being a liar, how his momma said my dad owed him an apology for that text, talking down to me, disrespecting my dad (his boss), it felt like it came out of nowhere. He left that night saying we would NEVER get back together. Guess who called the next day?

My ex ended up having his job offer rescinded because of that night. And when it happened, he told me that I had a choice to make: him or my family. That if I stayed with him, I could never speak to my family again. I went along with it for 2 months because I was angry about it, then texted my dad happy birthday a few weeks ago.

He broke up with my when I told him I texted my dad. It was an ugly break up. A few days later he called wanting to be friends, then said he'd be open to getting back together if I could figure out how to get our parents in the same room again, then blew up on me again for saying something that defended my dad, told me to never contact him again. Called me awful names and said there was no fixing me. He realized how hopeless I was. Threatened a lawsuit.

He called the next day saying his sister was working on a photo album of his newborn and they realized they didn't have a single picture of me holding him. Could I send them some? I was speechless. I spent hours trying to analyze what he meant. I was stupid enough to bring up our relationship and he got defensive again blaming me for the demise of our relationship and how my love must not have been real because I didn't make him my #1. He said that was the last contact I'd ever have from him, and despite me texting several times, he has not responded to a single one.

Does this sound like narcissism? My self esteem has suffered so much. It has made me feel crazy and wanting to blame myself. The blame has always been on me and my family. He has done no wrong."

I plan on taking ENG 331, which shouldn't be a problem since it's online, but I also want to take CSC 226, which is on campus starting at 5:30pm, 3 days a week. I don't necessarily NEED to take CSC 226 over the summer, but it could help prevent future scheduling issues and having too many classes during my senior year. 

My main question, from anyone's experience, do you think it would be reasonable to get an internship in the Raleigh area and work out with them that I would need to leave slightly early, 3 days a week, to take a class? "

Internship hunt couldn't have ended better.,Bobbers927,cigars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cigars/comments/58nwcq/finally_smoking_a_special_stick_internship_hunt/,"Last year I finally stopped lurking and did my first trade to get /u/shadowbates some Amazon Basin sticks from my local shop. He sent me some amazing sticks that I have had sitting waiting for a few things I knew were coming up.

I'm in my last year of college at age 29 after leaving a career to start a new one as a CPA. I applied to a national firm that has an office here in town for an audit/tax internship. Phone interview went well enough to get called in. My in-person interview went great, and instead of not hearing back until Monday of this week I got a call the next day from the partner in charge of consulting. I had told them that was my long term goal. He said I was ""a very popular topic of discussion around the office today"" and that he would like to have me come in and meet him and his team. Told me some things to research that won't necessarily be taught in depth in school.

Wednesday I went out with him and his team for drinks, and I left more excited than I have been since getting married. They said they never hire people right out of college due to the maturity and confidence levels required for the department, but with my sales and leadership background it was going to be perfect. I knew it was in the bag, and yesterday I got the call that I start November 7th. 

Boy has it been a scary ride taking pay cuts, changing employers to better fit my schedules, etc. I still can't believe I am going straight into the consulting department, as I thought I was going to have to have to work audit and tax for a few years before breaking in.

This morning before going to work I grabbed a [Grimalkin](http://zackthestogieman.blogspot.com/2011/09/emilio-cigars-grimalkin-torpedo-review.html), that Shad told me was one of his favorite cigars of all time, and tossed it in my dry box.

58oof0,0,2016-10-21,Need Advice,hotdamnmarkgram,ChemicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/comments/58oof0/need_advice/,"Hello all, I am having a problem.

I am a senior in chemical engineering. I've been having a struggle, I don't really know what I'm doing in this curriculum. I went into it because I've always excelled at math, science, and problem solving and all my life people have been telling me that I should be an engineer. I liked chemistry in highschool and my dad graduated college in chemical engineering, so that's what I decided to go into.

But after my freshman year my dad got diagnosed with cancer and past away last year. Everything has seemed like a blur and I feel like I haven't had any time to think about whether or not I really want to be a Chem E. But now I feel like my life is falling apart, I took a break this semester and am just trying to spend time with my family.

In my time at college I have enjoyed a few classes, like Materials and Energy Balance and Optimization, but I haven't liked any of the classes I've recently taken. It could be because I've lost focus or any drive that I've had or that I haven't been able to get an internship or co-op. I am worried I am going to hate any future Chem E job, but I'm so far into the curriculum I feel like I should just get the degree.

Would a degree in chemical engineering give me a lot of options or would I just be stuck working at a plant for the rest of my life?

Should I change my major or just finish it?"

58otmk,1,2016-10-21,FAQ's,rampagerrrrr,MCPHSLifeHack,https://www.reddit.com/r/MCPHSLifeHack/comments/58otmk/faqs/,"Frequently Asked Questions
Here you’ll find answers to some of my most asked questions. But first:
The 4 Noble Truths of Pharmacy
1. Pharmacy is saturated. There are way too many schools and graduates.           With Massachusetts being one of THE WORST places in the country for said     saturation. 

2. Yes, community is stressful and can make you cynical.

3. Uh huh, pharmacy school is overpriced along with almost all other forms of       higher education. I will not delve into this. 

4. You really should work in a pharmacy before entering pharmacy school. If you enter the 0-6 program right out of high school you probably won’t have a chance to experience a pharmacy, but then again you graduate sooner and with less hassle.

________________________________________________________________

Q: How do you become a Pharmacist?
A: How To Become a Pharmacist (Abridged)
Ok this is a quick outline of what you have to do to actually become an actual pharmacist. The one making the big bucks. This is more intended for people who haven’t started college yet, or people who are thinking about switching to Pharm D. If you are ANY year in the Pharm D program, you should already be familiar with this process. Again, this is a rough sketch. It looks a lot easier here than it actually is. Oh and btw this is for the 0-6 program! Not the old fashioned pathway. 

1. Bang out 1st year. This year really is easy if you put in the 15 minutes to study for your classes. Don’t take the 15 minutes thing literally. In fact take all internet blogs with a grain of salt. 

Just do your homework
Stay out of trouble
I’m not telling you not to drink and smoke. You are an adult and as far as I’m concerned these are your decisions. All I’m saying is don’t get caught, because you CANNOT be a pharmacist with even the slightest blemish on your record. Except for like speeding tickets and stuff. 

2. Romance the 2nd year. Not much more difficult than 1st year. But you WILL struggle with Organic Chemistry. This will give you an idea how some classes will be in your professional years. Not all, but some. That’s really the only thing that stands out about this year. I suggest watching the Khan Academy videos on orgo if you want a head start. 

Organic chem is hard. 
At the end of this year, you must register to become a pharmacy intern in massachusetts
This will enable you to do rotations (which we will talk about in a little). But you should find work beforehand. 

3. Shit gets serious 3rd year. This is your first Professional Year, also known as P1. Do your due diligence, balance school and social life, and try to find work in a pharmacy. You also get a snazzy new white coat that you have to wear to labs. 

Obtain professional white coat
Must get CPR training as part of a class
Must get HIPAA certified as part of class
Do your IPPE rotations for 4 weeks during the next summer
4. Get fucked in the ass by 4th year. Widely considered to be the hardest year. Again, deal with it, no whining, no excused, just fucking do it. 

5. Do a Capstone Project during 5th year. This sounds annoying as fuck, because it really is. Almost every graduate student has to do it. Yes, you could as a graduate student. Because when you graduate you are a DOCTOR of pharmacy, not a bachelor of science. You basically have to pick a topic to research or come up with a business model or something. And write a huge fucking paper. It’s pretty involved because you’ll probably have to create your own data via survey or something. More on that here: http://www.gradschoolhub.com/faqs/what-is-a-capstone-project-in-graduate-school/

6. Final year! You’re done with classes! You will spend this entire year doing something called rotations. I mentioned it earlier and you though I was gonna forget. Faggot. Anyway, rotations are when you actually intern at various pharmacy settings. This goes on for about a year straight. You do not have a summer break. You will go from May to the next May. You’ll spend a few months at each of the following settings:

Retail
Institutional
Inpatient
Ambulatory
Graduate with your PharmD!!!!1111!1111
7. Oh you thought you were done motherfucker?? NAPLEX exam bitch! What you thought you were gonna walk off into the sunset and collect your first check for $100,000??? WRONG. You now have to pass NAPLEX in order to get a license and start practicing. You can actually take NAPLEX a little bit before you graduate. But a lot of people end up taking it 2 or 3 months after graduation. Why? Because they’re burnt and they want a break before spending a month or 2 studying for this. 

Naplex consists of 

Science, drugs, everything you learned in school 
185 Multiple choice questions
4 hours and 15 minutes
Taken on the computer at a test center near you
Only 150 questions are legit. The remainder are experimental questions that don’t count, but youll never know
It’s an “adaptive” test. That’s a fancy way of saying it’s trying to fuck you over. If you get a cetain type of question wrong, the computer will give you more of those types of questions. 
Need a score of 75 or above to pass. 
People often report feeling like they failed, even though they eventually realize that they passed. 
Takes 5 business days for you to see your score
8. But wait! There’s more: MPJE. I promise you, this is the end of it. The final piece of the puzzle before you never have to study for anything ever again. I achieved orgasm just writing that sentence. The MPJE is a pharmaceutical law exam that you have to pass. You cannot take this one before you graduate. Once you finish this, you are all set to practice. Unlike the NAPLEX, it is unique to each state. While some states will accept it if you took it somewhere else, you should TRY TO TAKE IT IN THE STATE YOU WILL BE WORKING IN. Don’t take it in Boston if you planned to move home to San Diego all along. And btw, it’s called the CPJE in California. 

MPJE is:

Unique to each state. Tests 90% state law, 10% federal
Reportedly harder than the Naplex
90 multiple choice questions. 60 count. 
Questions are often very obscure state laws
Also questions on obscure situations that never happen
TAKE IN THE FUCKING STATE YOU WILL WORK IN
And on the day when you check your email and see you passed the MPJE, you can burn all your books, tear up your assignments, and invite your old pal mcphslifehack over for a drink. And then we’re gonna throw the wildest fucking party the world has ever seen. See ya later children!
_____________________________________________________________
Q: I read a lot of negative things about this school. Should I be scared?
A: Ok some of the negative things you read about this school are true, and some are not. I would say the worst things about this school is the lack of space, lab resources, a handful of bad teachers who force you to learn entirely on your own, and they waste a lot of money on stupid shit, like build-a-bear. Negative comments I believe to be untrue are people who write “MCPHS is a scam skool. All the classes are impossibly hard, and you will definitely fail out if you aren’t liek a genius or something. You’ll have no life and…” I think you get it. Let me explain where these false negative reviews come from. In my view, this school severely over accepts for undergrad seats. That means they accept many, many more students than they can facilitate, knowing a good portion will fail or drop out before reaching graduate/professional years. Why? More tuition. College is about money, not education. Because they accepted so many unqualified students, this place has a relatively high failure rate. I believe the vast majority of these failings happen before professional years. There are lots of people in undergrad who simply don’t want to do the work. All they did is drink and smoke through exams, and then move back home with mom and dad and write negative reviews all day. Unfortunately, some of the students are also just not cut out for the field, which I can respect. But I believe a good portion of the failing students did not take college seriously.
Look, professional/graduate years are going to be tough. But not impossibly, genius level tough. If it’s impossible, why do so many people actually graduate? Not saying it’ll be a cake-walk but there will be time for a life, and you can still get the good grades, and you’ll be fine if you are willing to accept that this is college and studying is your priority.
______________________________________________________________
Q: Should I go to MCPHS or School X?
A:  You should definitely go to whatever school will be the cheapest option for you. Keep in mind whatever scholarships each school gives you, transportation/living expenses, and how many loans you’ll need if any. AVOID LOANS IF AT ALL POSSIBLE. Debt is fucking disgusting. 
______________________________________________________________
Q: What is the GPA to stay in Pharm D?
A:  By the end ofthe first year, you need to have a 2.0. That said, it’s very very bad and you shouldn’t aim for that. Because in order to move on after 2nd year, you need a 2.7.
______________________________________________________________
Q: What is a passing grade for a class?
A:  C-. For those of you who raised an eyebrow and went to grab your professionally bound copy of the student handbook…SHHHHHH. We’re going to tell the 1st and 2nd years it’s C-. 
______________________________________________________________
Q: Are there parties here or is it just nerds studying all the time?
A:  Parties are located in Mission Hill, Alston, Northeastern, and BU. Go wild you turd.
______________________________________________________________
Q: Is pharmacy still a good field?
A: Read the 4 Noble Truths above and determine if you think you could do it. Every job has its upsides and downsides. Don’t let anyone tell you pharmacy is a wonderland of money and happiness, but don’t let anyone convince you it’s the worst job and that literally anything else would be better either. Everybody thinks their job is the worst or the hardest. Very few people get to do what makes them happy for a living. Remember that. 
______________________________________________________________
Q: I am a parent posing as my child and tell me literally every assignment, every page number of every book that my child will need. 
A:  First off, learn to relax. I bet your kid can’t wait to move out of your house and maintain very limited contact with you for the rest of your lives. If you raised your kid to be independent and discipline themselves into studying, they will be fine and they will figure it out. You can’t hold your child’s hand forever. Are you barge into the pharmacy in 10 years and make sure they know what they’re doing? Of course you are, crazy mother fucker.

Q: Your blog sucks and you spread wrong information. I will doxx you.

58ouoe,123,2016-10-21,Me [22 F] feeling uncomfortable about my boyfriend's [22 M] friend [24F],Akemia,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/58ouoe/me_22_f_feeling_uncomfortable_about_my_boyfriends/,"Hello, Reddit. This is my first time posting, but I've been a lurker before. Forgive me if something about my post is wrong.


I'm at my wits end. Between you and me, I think my boyfriend is too interested in his friend. ** Be warned, this is a LONG one. **


It all started a couple months ago. You should know we were long distance for over a year but less than two, and made sure to have as many visits together as we could in that time period. It wasn't a small flight, or a small time zone difference, but we made it work. We also had daily Skype dates between our real life time together.


About six months ago, my boyfriend and I decided we were done with long distance and wanted to move in together. At this time, it made more sense for him to move to me, as I'm finishing up University this year and have an internship starting soon. 


About ten or so weeks ago, he made the move, and we've been living together relatively easily. Except for one thing.


Shortly after he booked his flight, he started hanging out with this girl. They went on a couple ""friend dates"" together - out for dinner, etc. He even slept over at her house once. When we were on Skype, he'd sometimes tune out, caught up in texting her (which is not something he typically did before.)


I was getting uncomfortable, so I decided to do some research. She's tall, willowy, and beautiful. She also does a lot of amateur model type stuff. Furthermore, she apparently gets kicks out of posting extremely revealing photographs of herself. My boyfriend, for the most part, seemed enamoured. 


He assured me, however, that it was nothing. She's engaged and lives with her fiancé. So I let it go. But I couldn't shake the feeling, so a couple weeks into living together, I broke down and invaded his privacy by reading some of their texts. I know, I know. I shouldn't have, but I thought I was putting my mind at ease. Instead, I saw that they were frequently telling each other ""love you"" and expressing on a daily basis that they missed each other. I also learned from this that he had bought her jewellery, and she was wearing it. She also sent him multiple revealing photos, which, after seeing her social media, I wasn't overly surprised about. (Not happy though!)


I didn't want to admit I had snooped, but I eventually did because I was so shaken. He was livid that I had read his messages, but apologised for making me upset. He promised to back off with the affection.


I understand to an extent - he's homesick. It's different living here than it was where he is from, and he's far away from his family. I try to be extremely sympathetic to that, and I'm always asking if I can help, trying to do new things with him, and doing little things to make his life easier. To me though, they're being inappropriate for people who are supposedly in committed relationships.


And so for a while, I forced myself to get over it. I felt violated, but he promised things would change, so I trusted him. I guess I should be ashamed, but I checked his messages again when he left his Facebook open to their conversation, and things did seem marginally better. She was still trying hard to get him to give her attention, and calling him pet names, but for the most part he wasn't reciprocating.


But for some reason, I just can't shake this gut feeling that there's something off. I'm not necessarily saying he's in love with her, he's just so invested in her and attached to her, especially when he's only known her a couple months. Sometimes I feel like he's more concerned with her and her well being than he is me. I know I shouldn't feel that way. He's said more than once he would pick me over anyone else.


Don't get me wrong, he's a great boyfriend otherwise. I'm happy being in a relationship with him. When it's just us, we're extremely compatible. It's just, since she's been in his/our life, I haven't felt secure. 


He's kind of sneaky about talking to her now. He always closes their messages the minute I walk into the room, or hides his phone so the screen isn't visible when he's not on it. The other day his phone beeped. I asked him who it was - he does that to me all the time - and he said his brother. It hurt, because I saw the screen quickly before he hid it, and I know it was her.


They weren't talking as much recently, and he said that was his doing out of ""consideration"" for me, but I just found out today it's because she broke up with her fiancé and disappeared for a little bit. Now she's back, and trying to start up the weird behaviour again - offering my boyfriend lewd pictures, sending him pictures of herself, telling him she loves/misses him, etc. I worry that it will become even more overt because she is no longer restricted by a fiance. 


I know I'm out of line in saying this, but I just wish she would disappear from our lives. I can't even fathom saying that to him, because I don't think it's my place, but it's eating me alive. I have struggled with self esteem and destructive behaviour in the past, as he knows, and this is aggravating all those bad thoughts again. I can't help but compare myself to her, and feel I fall short in every way. Plus, he's always telling me how much better home was, and it just makes me feel so flat. Especially knowing she still lives there.


I'm not sure what I'm looking for here, I guess I just needed to vent to someone. It's hard to keep it bottled up all the time. And before anyone tells me this, yes, I know. I violated his privacy, and I need to stop. However, I have 100% no problem letting him go through anything on my phone/computer, and frequently let him use both for whatever he wants. Regardless, he would be so mad at me if he knew. I am not proud of it, and I'm trying to just.. let it go. It's just hard to when I'm so disconcerted about everything.


I'm not looking for people to tell me how stupid I am, or chew me out for not respecting his privacy. I just need advice on how to feel secure in my relationship again. Because I love him more than anything, and something about this situation scares me. At this point I just feel he finds her far more exciting than he does me.


** TL/DR **

My boyfriend has a friend who he's a little too friendly with. He tries to hide their interaction from me now, and makes me feel silly for being upset. I'm feeling extremely insecure in our relationship, but I want to fix things.



EDIT: I just wanted to say thank you for making me feel a little less crazy. I'm still not sure how I'm going to deal with this, but you've all definitely given me some food for thought. I really appreciate anyone who has taken the time to respond to me. 


** UPDATE: ** So, I took some of the advice here and expressed to him that I didn't think I could feel secure in our relationship as long as they're speaking. If he had tried to make me comfortable before, I might have been able to get over it, but it's gone on too long.


He has at this point removed her from Facebook. We haven't talked about that, but I noticed when I checked this morning.


I also took some advice to read a little deeper into their conversations, and I was saddened to see how much they talk about sex. Not really about them having sex, but the majority of their conversations revolved around what they like, their sexual experiences, and how much they both wanted to ""get laid"" (me being so far away made that part of our relationship rather impossible, obviously.) 


I also came to the conclusion she was not monogamous with her fiancé, as she often talked about having sex with other people in present tense. This clearly made me more uncomfortable, but I am going to try and see how things go. It will take me a while to believe she is really gone and he isn't just trying to pull wool over my eyes again. 


Once again, thank you so much to everyone who took the time to reach out to me and offer me advice. It means the world to me that I had someone to turn to."

I loved Season 1 but now I feel like it's lost its vibe a bit. It seems more dramatic and jumpy and fast paced but I thought the first season had enough of all of those elements already. I can't believe they aren't even going to mention Neil and Krista leaving. Also, do these three new first year residents seem less knowledgeable than the four from the first season? These guys must also have done an internship but in some ways it seems like they're starting off. And did Angus go to rehab for Adderall abuse? If so that was just kind of thrown in there, we didn't see any development of that. I'm missing the lack of staff-to-staff moments like Malaya and Angus, Momma and Daddy.

I dunno, I really loved the first season. I've read a bit about the second season online and it seems like the network is trying really hard to pull in new viewers which is why they're increasing the drama and the patient stories I guess."

58pdbt,0,2016-10-21,Pro-Life - Looking to start a peaceful and informative exchange between peoples of all beliefs!,t_hood,prochoice,https://www.reddit.com/r/prochoice/comments/58pdbt/prolife_looking_to_start_a_peaceful_and/,"Hi all!

Before I begin, I would like to *stress* that I mean absolutely no disrespect with any questions or statements I make. 

Perhaps the best way to begin is explain a little bit about myself; I am a male, freshman in college, Catholic, type-1 diabetic, and pro-life. Also relevant, I currently have an internship with a local organization, which strives *peacefully* and prayerfully bring an end to abortion in Missouri. We do **not** yell, accuse, guilt, shame, demonize, harass, or in any way ensue conflict with Planned Parenthood or any of their clients. We simply wish to provide women with alternative, **free** resources. Certainly, many of you understand that an abortion is hardly ever a women's first choice; our job is to help these women, who are struggling through any number of life issues, understand that abortion is not their *only* choice, and to also pray for these woman, children, and their families. 

Here is my main reason for posting:

Today I realized that pro-choicers are not evil. In fact, I would argue that many are not necessarily huge fans of abortions, but simply believe that a woman should have the option to seek help to make an informed decision that is best for her. In some sense, pro-life (at least, my experience with it) and pro-choice are not so different (sans abortion views). Truly, we both just seek to provide women with care, love, support, and resources. However, the divide over abortion leads me to speculate: what are your beliefs? Is there an alternative to abortion? Do any of you wish to see an end to abortion? I would love to read detailed and well-thought out responses and to hear anyone's views. 

Just to begin the debate, here are my thoughts:

I would very much prefer to avoid being to black/white, but I do not think I can beat around the bush - simply put, I do not think that abortion should be legal. Of course there are extraordinary circumstances, such as rape, incest, threat to woman's life, etc. As a Catholic, I believe that each and every one of these scenarios can be overcome, but only though generous acts of love and support. Adoption is always a viable option for instances of unforeseen pregnancies; there are countless organizations that will walk women all the way through their pregnancy and offer resources and support, and continue to provide assistance post-birth. Likewise, as a Catholic, I believe that the purpose of sex is to be an act of love and openness to the creation of new life. So, in response to situations of mother's health being at risk, I have found the following quote from the Diocese of Phoenix 

""We may never perform an intrinsically evil act even to bring about a great good. For example, a just society cannot intentionally kill innocent civilians in a war, even for the praiseworthy goal of ending a conflict quickly and saving many lives. Likewise, in the context of pregnancy, a woman may not be killed in order to save the life of her child, and a child may not be killed in order to save the life of his mother. However, the Church does permit morally neutral medical procedures designed to save a pregnant woman’s life that may have an unintended side-effect of causing a child to die in the womb, such as the removal of a cancerous uterus. ""

I believe abortion is a great moral issue we face. However, I also realize that it is the effect of underlying causes in our society. As my own personal belief, I have come to conclude that society has de-sanctified the value and sacredness that comes with sex. Modern culture presses the idea that sex is the greatest good in life, and that it is something that can simply ""be had"" in order to satisfy an urge (like eating a sandwich to alleviate hunger). When sex is thought of in this context, it entirely removes the biological components of sex - to procreate. Man seems to think he can control how he was made through artificial contraceptives; while effective, they can never be guaranteed to work, which gives rise to issues when an ""unwanted"" pregnancy occurs. Engaging in a sexual relation with one's mind and heart set out for only pleasure, and no regards for the awesome power and potential of life, is wrong (in my eyes). It comes to violate the biological purposes of sex. Here is a good analogy I once heard - think of sex in a similar fashion to eating. Consider the two sides to eating (and sexual relations) - biological (nutrition/to procreate) and for pleasure (food taste good/to express an act of love). Let's say we eat a salad. The salad is packed with vitamins and healthful benefits, and satisfies the biological side of eating ( to acquire nutrients and energy), while perhaps not entirely satisfying the pleasurable side. Now, take the action of eating a doughnut. There is very little biological reason (maybe it will fill you up a bit, but there are hardly any nutrients present), but you certainly get more pleasure from eating the doughnut than the salad. What's the idea here? Both acts consisted of eating, but for different motives. Eating the doughnut was to experience pleasure, and less for biological reasons, **but** the biological reasons were not shut out. Indeed, even in eating the doughnut, some nutrition was able to be digested. We were still *open* to the potential nutrition in the doughnut. Sexual relations are similar; sometimes we may want to express love for one another, and that's okay! We just must still be open to the awesome potential and possibility of new life. Failure to do so would violate the biological component. 

Ultimately, I pray for a world in which everyone can come to love one another, despite differences in beliefs. As humans, we all have an inherent dignity and right to life! As a society, we should be focused upon supporting and promoting the common good. To everyone reading, I apologize for the wall of text! Person of faith or not, God bless you, and thank you for taking the time to read! I'd love to have a thoughtful discussion and exchange result from this. I'm hoping everyone, regardless of beliefs, feels comfortable and welcome sharing their thoughts here! "

Started when I was 11, and it's long past due that I put this behind me. The summer was fine--relapsed a few times, looked at porn once or twice, but other than that I was going strong. 

Now I'm back at school, all my friends are having sex, and I'm left in the dust--whatever the reason (and I know I can't blame external forces here), I've been weak. I relapsed tonight, twice, looking at porn--a few days ago, a few days before that...I want it to stop, but the part of me--what does David Foster Wallace call it...the spider? I keep feeding that part of me. 

I'm prepared to go monk mode on this. I take cold showers, I wake up early, I work out, I spend almost all of my time on schoolwork and an internship, I'm about to graduate and it even looks like I might have a future...but this keeps dragging me down. I'm far from any kind of rock bottom, I've seen what alcoholics and hard drug users do to themselves, but it's reaching some kind of breaking point (I hope). 

My best streak was 39 days. It's not the streaks that matter, so much, it's not being able to get through the day.

58qeoh,5,2016-10-21,Demon Rehabilitation - Part 25,AlinaKG,AlinaKG,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlinaKG/comments/58qeoh/demon_rehabilitation_part_25/,"I thought Peter would be safer with Harry because he knew how both sides worked. His mother was completing a twenty year sentence in hell and I saw him visiting her at the halfway house on more than one occasion.

I say twenty years loosely. Because if a judge—usually a retired reaper, unbiased and with a knack for seeing right through humans—decided a soul was not ready, could commit the same crimes again, had not accepted their punishment and thought, perhaps that they shouldn’t have been in hell at all, then they go back and restart the process. An angel and a demon were always present—at one point I had done this job—and could argue on behalf of the soul. Demons always had a reason. Souls are good business.

Her treatment of him was the sole reason she ended up there in the first place. Out of guilt and love, Harry applied for the internship to help her. This was an assumption on my part, of course, but he had more visits logged after he got the internship than before. Think of that what you want.

I had my own appointment to make at the halfway house. Without Deborah’s help, this was my only way to contact Sid. Everyone was allowed one visit a month. Even the worst of the worst. I could not see Lucifer backing out of this. Few demands came from heaven’s side—space for the rehabilitation office, visitations for family members and friends, and a variation in sentences according to crimes committed—but the few that did were set in stone. If Lucifer or his demons defied them any of these three things, Heaven would get involved in Hell’s business. And nobody wanted that. The angels liked to keep a safe distance away from the place.

I was avoiding the visit, hoping that by the time I got around to visiting him, he and Melissa had already come into contact with each other and I did not have to explain how much I failed him. Sid was an easy man to please but a difficult one to betray. Crazy as a bat, with the memory of an angry woman, he rarely let things go. 

In his mind, things were black and white. He wanted something from me, I did not provide it. Details were irrelevant and our odd friendship compromised.

I came home hoping to ask Harry a couple of questions about the halfway house. The only person I could think of that would actually bother or want to see me was Mae, and she had been in there with me. So I never really cared enough to inquire how the whole thing worked.

Loud music and the huffs and puffs of people came from the television downstairs. Harry liked action films and, as I’ve come to notice, had the ears of a ninety year old deejay. 

“I’m home, Harry,” I shouted as I came downstairs. Peter’s giggles sounded among the boom of a loud explosion. I turned the corner and doubled back as I saw Lily, sitting on the couch farthest from Harry. Peter was in her lap. He turned to me and widened his toothless smile.

Harry nodded once and turned off the TV. He stood and chucked the remote onto the couch. Lily had yet to look at me. I guess Harry must have noticed because the pat on the back he gave me when he passed served more as a good luck than a goodbye.

“You feeling better?” I asked her after giving Harry a sufficient amount of time to disappear.

She glanced at me past Peter’s head, and then pulled his pram closer with her toe, secured him in it, and stood to fetch the remote. Scrolling through the channels, she stopped at the first cartoon that popped up on the screen. 

Lily folded her arms and watched Peter for a second before turning to me. “Did you kill his mother?”

A hot flash ran through me. I opened my mouth and closed it again. How much do you know? I thought. “No.”

“His father?”

 Alright, so, not that much. Peter’s grandmother killed him. It was all over the local news. “No.”

“But you were involved?”

“Not in their deaths.”

She narrowed her eyes, as if trying to see whether ‘liar’ would appear on my forehead if she focused enough. “Right.” She shook her head. I’ve never seen disappointment flare through anyone’s eyes so transparently. “Well, I’m about to call the police”—I wondered whether she knew how irrelevant that was to me—“and tell them exactly where Pepper is. So, unless—”

The front door flew open. The doorknob smashed against the wall, causing the entire door to vibrate. Harry came stomping in, flushed and wide eyed.

“You have to get them out,” he said.

“What? Why?”

“There’s a mark on your house.”

I wanted to say that he was mistaken. That a mark on my house was strictly against the rules—or had I just assumed it was? Pepper was not to be harmed. But Harry left the house in such a hurry that all these thoughts left my mind and I ran after him. The rattle attached to Peter’s pram sounded as Lily pushed him our way.

Harry was on the garden path when I walked out. I came to stand next to him and turned around. It was dark out but the mark was darker. A set of upside down wings, or rather their smoky shadow, floated just above the house. The darker the mark, the bigger the reward for the demon who arrives first and gets the job done. This one made it look as if reality cracked and formed a hole in the sky. 

Lily walked toward us with her head turned in the direction Harry and I were staring. “What is it?”

“You won’t see it,” Harry said. 

“When was the last time you came outside before now?” I asked him. This wasn’t right. Rules and Lucifer did not work well together, that I knew. But Peter’s safety had been important to him too. If he died a child, I won. So, I could not understand why this was allowed.

“Well, it certainly wasn’t there then.” Harry started to walk down the street. “Let’s go.”

I waved Lily along and followed Harry. “What are they playing at?”

“Peter is safe. You’re not. I guess, they’re sending a message.”

“No,” I shook my head, “the message was—” I stopped mid-sentence but both parties understood exactly what I intended to say. Lily started to walk a little faster. “This is something else. They’ve proven that they can get to me.”

“Maybe they’re just trying to make your life difficult. You can’t go back there now.”

“Maybe.” I did not believe this. Lucifer was smart, and patient when he wanted something bad enough. The mark contrasted both. If something happened to Peter  . . . and it so easily could have. It felt almost as if he was gambling, chancing the outcome for his entertainment. No one else had the authority to place it.

“Where do we go? I’ll follow till you’re safe, then I’ll have to inform Deborah,” Harry said and looked behind him at the street, then at the house.

“Cross the road here.” I pointed toward Lily’s house.

She made no gesture of protest. Fear replaced her earlier disappointment. Her knuckles were white from how hard she gripped the bar of the pram where Peter now slept. I put a hand on her back. This must have brought back the night Kel attacked her. Her eyes ticked to me and then she glanced over her shoulder at the road. 

“It’s not my house,” she said, looking straight ahead.

“That doesn’t matter. As long as we’re not there.”

“No,” she exhaled, “Kel was the one that sent me there. He gave me the house.”

My head rocked back. “Kel? The man that attacked you? You knew him?” My hand slipped from her back. Had I been so careless?

“Yes. I knew him.”

The street was empty, but it wouldn’t be for long. What to do? What to do? I thought. “It could be a trip,” I said to Harry.

“Could be but where else can you go?”
“There is a place.”

“How far?”

“Tibeen.”

He nodded. “That’s probably a smarted idea.” Harry stopped in front of Lily’s house—or Kel’s I suppose. “Do you have a car?”

“There’s a McDonald’s down the road. Think it’s better if we call a taxi and wait there.”
*****
Lily did not say much in Harry’s presence, and when she did speak, it was mostly to Peter. When the taxi arrived, Harry said his goodbyes and left for the bathroom, from where he’d return to Deborah.

I expected her to say something while we walked to the car, but she kept her head down and disturbed me with further silence. Greeting the driver, I opened the door and waited for her to get in. She stood still, eyes lowered to the pavement and staring into nothingness.

“Do you want to be remembered, Lily?” I asked her. 

Most people want to be heroes. They want to accomplish something that will glue their face and name to the living, long after they’re gone. Nothing to be ashamed of, immortality is alluring. 

She did not move, clutching on to Peter and no doubt wondering how she’d get him away from me to safety.

“What I’m doing here . . .  The consequences will be irrevocable. Either for me or for humanity and the celestial. An opportunity to challenge Lucifer comes once every millennium—if even that. I’ll explain every little detail, I promise, but you must come with me.”

“Why?”

 Stunned by her question, expecting something more on the lines of, ‘Challenging Lucifer? Are you a narcissist or just fucking mental?’ I struggled to think of a proper response. The streetlight shone down on her arms and made the tiny scars on her arms shine. And I just knew. “I’ll help you fight back and you’ll help keep me . . . sane.”

“I’ll go with you to Tibeen but not because I give a shit about your sanity. Don’t take this as a threat because I don’t intend it as one—” she turned to me finally, eyes narrowed and the corners of her mouth pulled down—“but if you do not tell me the whole truth, I’m gone. I’m calling Pepper’s grandmother, his grandfather, I’m calling the police and whoever the fuck else will listen to me, and I won’t care who you’re challenging or why, or whether what I do ends up killing you.” She put a foot into the car. “I won’t be a prop again.”

The driver pretended not to listen, but he sat quiet and still as a corpse, and had since turned the radio down to hear us better.

Lily climbed into the car and scooted over. I folded the pram and put it away, then climbed in myself. 

“Are you two actors?” he asked. His thin, grey hair was pulled back into an oily ponytail and faded tattoo covered his arms.

I nodded. “Yes, we work for the theater down the road.”

“My wife keeps bugging me to take her, but all you’ve played recently was Peter Pan. The fuck does she think I’m going to want to sit through that for? Maybe now, I’ll take her. That actually sounds like something I’d watch.”

“Thanks.” I closed the door.

“Just a little thick on the dialogue, I think. That whole saving your sanity part’s a little feminine, don’t you think? Made me cringe a little. I mean, he’s asking her to take on the devil, for Christ’s sake. Be a man about it!”

Lily turned her head, but I saw a smile pucker her cheeks. “Yes, I think he needs to tone it down too.”

Anyways a little background about me, I am an 3D animation student and very passionate about getting into the industry I know that companies look favorably on candidates who have intern experience so I am striving to get one every year. Last year I got an internship at a up and coming art atelier and gallery. It was a small team consisting of 4 people and was very lax about the internship and never specified an end date. 


There was 2 people that I received duties from; the marketing manager who was like my trainer (lets call him X) and the founder of the studio (ZZ).


There was some tension between X and ZZ and eventually X left to start his own magazine company leaving ZZ without his right hand man. Here is the shitty thing that I did; I left when ZZ probably needed my the most without a word, like I just didn't show up. To be fair the time that X left was when I was supposed to leave too but it sounds ridiculous and I know but I didn't know what I should've done in that situation and never put in my 2 weeks so I just panicked and stopped going. So far it's been 5 months and I am going crazy thinking about it. 


After the incident I am still in touch with X and he is is happy to give my a recommendation (last time I talked to him)  for linkedin but I would like to apologize and own up to my mistake with ZZ. I am still learning and I realize that what I did was really wrong and frankly unprofessional regardless of my age. I don’t want this to reflect badly on my career in the future or next summer's internship. 

Whats steps should I take to reconcile besides emailing which I am planning on doing?? 

Thank you!!!

I was once that guy... I worked really hard in school, never partied, graduated early, and got a good internship in a nice college. My parents set up my whole life for me to be this successful square... But I hated it, from the advanced classes to get ahead in school to the Vyvanse I'd been taking to focus! 

Right around that time I heard Generation Why, and I fucking loved it. I had to find out more. I ate up their music, listened to every song, learned the words, etc.. What truly made me a fan though... The Fan-base. From the angsty teens to the recovering drug addicts we all relate to the music somehow!

When I got the chance to work as a stagehand it pushed me to take the chance. I quit my job, dropped out of school, and moved across the country with no real plans or goals!

That was 9 months ago, now I'm turning 19, I don't regret a thing. I'm a stagehand/roadie now, and I love my job! I wouldn't take a 9-5 for all the money in the world. Was it scary at times, sure. Did it take time for me to make new friends, yeah. But it's been the best 9 months of my life! 

I know this is a super Cliché story but it might have never happened without this band! I love this band... I love this sub... I love the whole fucking fan-base!

58rdlt,49,2016-10-21,Should I [22F] tell my supervisor [40sM] of over a year about my severe clinical depression?,PissInBoots,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/58rdlt/should_i_22f_tell_my_supervisor_40sm_of_over_a/,"I'm a research student in a neurorehabilitation lab. I've been under my supervisor's wing since the summer of 2015, when I specifically sought him out due to similarities in research interests. He's been nothing but wonderful and approachable, being more concerned that I learn techniques and things above all else. All I can say is I'm extremely appreciative of how patient he's been with me.

I don't know if he can kind of tell that I have depression, but it is certainly possible. I have a history of panic attacks, by my count I've had about 5-6 total in the past 2 years or so. He himself has witnessed a panic attack from me sitting in an MEG machine (big spacey looking machine where you sit with a giant helmet not moving for the duration of the experiment) for over an hour while piloting an experiment last year, and I've recently had another near-panic attack while helping out with a different experiment. I've only been in the MEG 3 times in total, so that's a 66% rate of panic attacks in the MEG. I don't know if that's relevant but he did mention it's not a particularly common thing to happen, though our experiments tend to be longer than 'normal' so that could have contributed. I'm not sure that he knows about the second one, since I was working with a grad student at the time, but it may have been mentioned to him since I was unable to complete the experiment.

The panic attacks are the biggest thing but I don't think they would happen in a normal working day since most of the stuff we do in the lab isn't that stressful (mostly coding, reading papers, writing stuff). My concern is that since my depression has a habit of oscillating between manageable and barely so, its flareups may be affecting my performance. However, whenever I do get these concerns, he usually meets/communicates with me at some point (he checks in every now and again) about what I've been up to in the lab and makes sure to tell me that I'm doing fine and that he's happy with the work I'm doing/the stuff I'm learning.

I don't want to sell myself short, since I have a long history of being in research labs for my age and I know I can be more productive, I know I'm not useless, however recently I've been struggling. Early this summer I had a suicidal episode, during summer I was relatively fine but I wasn't in the country (was doing an internship in my home country and I think the change in environment was beneficial), and since I've been back (~2 months now) I think I've been back in decline, with a very brief suicidal episode that happened about a week ago. I've been coming into lab late, leaving earlier than usual, and I feel like I'm generally not as productive as I was at this stage last year. I space out a lot now.

As far as what I'm doing to remedy the situation, I sought out walk in clinics and help lines and such at first until I was able to get a referral to a psychiatrist right next to my school, who is wonderful and takes care to communicate well with me in our sessions. I've been seeing him for over a year now, and we still haven't found the medication type/dosage that works for me (if it's relevant, I'm a fairly thin Asian girl so it could be metabolic or something), but we're upping my sertraline dose starting next week to see if that helps (we're pairing it with aripiprazole). I've been actively trying to improve my outlook and perspective and all that hippie stuff but sometimes I still crash and I can't bring myself to do anything.

---

**tl;dr**: I've been clinically depressed for years, been seeing help/medicated for over a year, am afraid that it's affecting my performance in the lab in which I'm a student. Should I tell my supervisor to let him know I'm struggling or is that inappropriate?"

The Democratic National Committee Chairperson Donna Brazile assailed videos from Project Veritas declaring that ""these stolen tapes should not be permitted to be viewed by voters prior to the election. Posing as a Democratic Party intern for the purpose of secretly gathering inside information is just a lowdown dirty trick.""

In a testy exchange with Fox News' Meagan Kelly, the DNC replacement for the previously disgraced Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, who was forced to resign after leaked emails revealed that she was leading an effort to rig the Democratic nomination process to benefit Hillary Clinton, Brazile attempted to divert attention from the content of the video expose´ by asserting that the manner in which the evidence was obtained ""renders it inadmissible"" and predicted that ""no prosecutor will ever bring charges against the Democratic Party.""

In the videos, Democratic ""black ops"" officials Scott Foval and Bob Creamer boasted of ""paying mentally ill 'street crazies'"" to instigate violence at Trump campaign rallies and carting around bogus voters to cast multiple ballots ""in states with weak voter ID laws."" Brazile contended that ""the deception and betrayal of trust by Veritas' phony volunteers goes beyond anything that we have previously seen. Campaign practices that have enjoyed 50 years of success are now threatened with neutralization by O'Keefe's criminal trespass.""

Brazile also argued that ""the emails stolen and published by Wikileaks are, as Secretary Clinton pointed out in the debate, a conspiracy by the Russians and Trump to undermine the November election. These emails were confidential communications. Their misappropriation by a foreign government is evidence of the threat to our democracy that Trump and his co-conspirators represent. No reputable news outlet will participate in repeating these lies to the American public."" She went on to forecast that ""after she's elected, President Clinton will most likely instruct her Attorney General to root out these enemies and put them out of commission.""

Ironically, in one of the leaked emails Brazile lamented ""the despair of many Americans over the state of the economy. There are new jobs, but they are low-wage and part-time jobs. The economic stagnation that has hit this country puts President Obama, his policies, and his supporters in the Democratic Party in an extremely unflattering light that does not bode well for how voters may react when casting their ballots.""

In related news, the 69-year-old Sharon Teeter who claimed that Trump supporter 73-year-old Richard Campbell punched her in the face at a rally earlier this year now ""remembers"" that ""he might have brushed me accidentally."" It seems that her memory was enhanced by her identification as a Democratic Party operative on the Veritas video of Foval calling her ""one of our trained political activists.""

Administration Promises Saudis it Will ""Fix"" 9/11 Victims Law

Still smarting from a Congressional override of his veto of the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, a law that allows victims of the 9/11 jihadi attack on the World Trade Center and Pentagon the right to sue foreign governments that aided the terrorists, President Obama has ordered Secretary of State John Kerry to work out a scheme with the government of Saudi Arabia to nullify the law.

In a meeting held this week, Kerry assured Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir that ""we will figure out how we can adjust the law in a way that is mutually satisfactory to both our governments.""

Al-Jubeir warned that ""numerous countries are looking at reciprocal measures to retaliate against this affront to Islam. If the Americans think that the alleged puny assistance my country may or may not have provided to the 9/11 attackers warrants this disproportionate response just let me remind them that there is much much more we could've done or might do in the future to make their lives miserable.""

The implied threat that Saudi Arabia might join the ranks of those Islamic nations openly financing terrorists moved Kerry to contend that ""a compromise is essential if we are to avert a blood bath we are not prepared to rebuff. The wiser course is to accept the lesser evil of the 'pin-prick' attacks that we have seen since 9/11 than to provoke the enmity of our long-time Saudi allies.""

Madonna Makes an Offer

Included in her introduction of comedian Amy Schumer at a New York City performance, pop star Madonna told the audience that ""if you vote for Hillary Clinton, I will give you a blow job."" It was not clear whether this was an inducement or a threat.

Audience member Richard Long of Queens found the prospect appealing. ""Madonna said she's not a douche and that she swallows,"" Long pointed out. ""That's classy. Hillary's got my vote.""

In contrast, audience member Anne Chester of Manhattan wondered ""whether this is the kind of thing a Clinton supporter ought to be saying. Look at all the trouble Trump got himself into for his lewd talk. I mean, blow jobs from Monica are what got President Clinton impeached. It makes you wonder which side is more tawdry.""

For her part, Schumer saw the offer as ""f*cking fantastic"" and predicted that ""there'll be a stampede of guys who were going to vote for Trump racing to get in line for their turn to be serviced by a true artist.""

Obamacare in ""Transition Phase""

Health insurance premium hikes and dwindling service alternatives under the Affordable Care Act were described by President Obama as ""a transition phase of the program.""

""Right now a lot of people are whining about having to pay more or having no choice of doctors or plans where they live,"" Obama remarked. ""All of these complaints originate from a selfish individual perspective. Sure, some isolated individuals may have to pay more and get less, but in the more crucial issue of our progress toward collective social justice we are on track.""

Before Obamacare, annual family premiums for employer-provided coverage cost an average of $13,000. This year those premiums are $18,000. For next year the already over-priced health plans mandated by the ACA have been authorized to jack up payments the insured must bear by 20% to 90% in various locations around the country. On top of these boosted prices, typical $5,000 annual deductibles result in most basically healthy individuals essentially getting zero benefits.

Meanwhile, the President's unilateral and unauthorized multi-billion dollar bailouts of selected health insurance companies have not been sufficient to prevent a continued cascade of exits from the market by these companies. The resulting decline of options has been characterized as ""a simplification that has spared many the difficult task of evaluating medical services that are really beyond their competence to evaluate,"" said Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell. ""Few are qualified to to assess what they need and how to get it. By pealing off the excess suppliers the ACA has lightened the burden of choosing for millions.""

Despite the unfavorable trends overtaking the ACA, presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has vowed ""to make it better."" One of her proposed improvements is to make illegal aliens eligible for enrollment in the program. ""Right now there are 30 million individuals living in the shadows because of their undefined immigration status,"" she declared. ""Making them eligible for health care is the humane thing to do."" The financial problems will be overcome ""by the injection of money"" obtained from ""increased taxes on those who can afford it.""

In other health news, a Democratic National Committee tour bus was caught illegally dumping human waste from its on-board toilet onto a Lawrenceville, Georgia street this week. The DNC issued an apology for what it claimed was ""an honest mistake. We had no idea that dumping hazardous waste onto a street could be illegal.""

Libertarian Bewails ""Double Standard""

Libertarian presidential candidate and former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson complained about the media's ""double standard"" after they ignored Hillary Clinton's geographic inaccuracy regarding Mosul while lampooning him as ""an ignorant dope"" when he failed to recognize ""Aleppo.""

""I wasn't Secretary of State for four years like Hillary was,"" he pointed out. ""I was peacefully minding my own business. Why should I be expected to know such minutia? But she is the one who supposed to be the world's smartest woman. She is the one who never ceases to remind us that she's got 30 years of experience in government. If she's so smart and experienced why doesn't she know where Mosul is?""

MCNBC interviewer Mike Barnicle, who ambushed Johnson with the Aleppo question back in September defended the double standard saying that ""Hillary Clinton's bona fides are not in dispute. She has already been thoroughly vetted by every major news outlet. We are confident that she knows what she is talking about even if she messes up. Johnson or Trump, on the other hand are the outsiders whose suitability for governing is questioned by every reputable source. Consequently, every misstep by these guys warrants our skepticism.""

In related news, President Obama forgave Hillary for revealing classified information on nuclear response times during her debate with Donald Trump Wednesday night. ""These 'senior moments' are something that anyone of her age might experience,"" he said. ""I'm confident there was no intent to illegally divulge this information. Besides, even if our adversaries are aware that it takes four minutes to initiate a retaliatory nuclear strike I don't see what advantage they'd gain by having that knowledge. So I forgive her and urge voters to make her our next president.""

Hillary ""Horrified"" by Trump's Abortion Comments

At this week's debate, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton professed herself ""horrified"" by GOP rival Donald Trump's denunciation of partial-birth abortions as ""ripping babies out of the womb"" and criticizing the practice as ""terrible"" and ""unacceptable.""

""Granted, the elimination of these near term fetuses is a gruesome procedure,"" she admitted. ""But what's more gruesome is Trump's attempt to use these tragic medical interventions as a scare tactic to overturn the rights established by Roe v. Wade. For too long state legislatures across the country unfairly prohibited or restricted a woman's right to an abortion. Fortunately, in 1973 the Supreme Court courageously stepped in to overrule these states. They didn't let rigid adherence to out-dated notions of separation of powers deter them from voiding clearly unjust legislation.""

Trump found fault with Clinton's position and averred that ""the role of the Court is to enforce the Constitution and laws made legislatures. It is not authorized to make new laws if it is dissatisfied with what the people's elected representatives have done."" Trump pledged that he would appoint judges who ""will be pro-life,"" ""have a conservative bent,"" and ""interpret the constitution the way the founders wanted it interpreted.""

Clinton rebutted Trump's position by pointing out that ""the number of individuals harmed by partial-birth abortions is tiny compared to the millions of women who have benefited from the Court's reinterpretation. Rather than try to rehash this issue it is time that we all adjust to the fact that the right to an abortion is now settled law and move forward instead of backward.""

In related debate news, Hillary defended using her role as Secretary of State to enrich herself, her husband, and the Clinton Foundation, insisting that ""everything I did as secretary of state was in furtherance of our country's interests and our values. That I and my family have prospered while I was doing that is what I would call 'collateral benefits.' I see no harm that it was a 'win-win' outcome.""

Media Assails Trump's ""Wait and See"" Stance on Election

The broadcast news ""talking heads"" went into hysterics following Republican presidential contender Donald Trump's refusal to automatically concede on election night if it looks like the votes go against him. On CNN, the commentators proclaimed Trump's stance ""a threat to our democracy."" All professed to have never heard such a statement at any previous presidential debate. Which is true because no other candidate was ever asked this question.

Whether Trump might have good reason to wait until he sees the election results for himself seems to be supported by several facts. On the one hand, there have been a number of pieces of evidence suggesting that fraud may play a significant role in deciding the outcome. The Wikileaks' publication of DNC emails that detailed how the Democratic Party leadership rigged the primaries against Bernie Sanders is a veritable ""smoking gun"" from the current election cycle. The Veritas videos exposing DNC-financed efforts to commit fraud also make a compelling case for scrutinizing the returns.

On the other hand, there seems to be an ample opportunity to perpetrate fraud given the large number of invalid names on voter rolls. Nearly two million deceased persons are still registered to vote. Nearly three million persons are registered to vote in more than one state. Then there's Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta's suggestion that non-citizens could use state-issued driver's licenses to register and vote. And leftist judges have voided state efforts to adopt voter ID requirements virtually everywhere except Indiana, where Democratic dirty tricks expert Scott Foval says ""it's easy to cheat.""

The same media that castigates Trump's reluctance to simply accept the November media-reported outcome as final hypocritically defended 2000 Democratic presidential candidate Vice-President Al Gore's refusal to accept the reported outcome on election day. Instead, he embarked on a legal challenge that took over a month to resolve.

President Obama tried to put it all into perspective by characterizing Trump's objections as ""whining. Nothing different is going on now. Every other Republican has accepted the verdict on election day, even though GOP complaints about election shenanigans have always been part of the rhetoric. His inability to take it like a man is further proof of his unfitness. I'm not surprised that genuine Republicans have universally condemned Trump's caterwauling and sought to distance themselves from him.""

Whether Obama should have any credibility on this issue is in serious doubt. Bob Creamer, one of the architects of the long-running election fraud scheme uncovered by Project Veritas, visited the Obama White House more than 300 times and met with the President more than 40 times. However, Press Secretary Josh Earnest discounted the significance of these meetings because ""the President is not the kind of person who would condone the kind of 'dirty tricks' of which Mr. Creamer is accused.""

In related news, Ohio Governor John Kasich (R) called Trump's fear that the election could be rigged ""ridiculous. My good friend George Soros' company owns about half of the voting machines that will be used and he assures me that the election will be fair.""

58st5z,3,2016-10-22,I [23F] keep scaring myself after dates with this guy [24M] who has been nothing but great.,nonbinaryunicorn,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/58st5z/i_23f_keep_scaring_myself_after_dates_with_this/,"Full disclosure, I'm on the transgender spectrum. But if I put GQ (genderqueer) up there, it has to get moderator approval so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Anyway, into the meat of the story. I broke out of an engagement and LDR of three years back in January, and though I did try to date again shortly after, the guy I was dating was too clingy and needy and freaked me out. He started saying I love you after a week! So I broke it off and ended up moving back to my hometown area a few months later.

I mentioned to my sister that I was kind of wanting to date again, and she recommended me the app Bumble. So I pulled it up, fixed my profile pictures to actually be of me (as opposed to stuff like my dog or Asgore from *Undertale*). Lo and behold, I match with a couple people, including this guy that I start talking to. We'll call him Sam.

This was 18 days ago, on a Tuesday. That Thursday we met up for coffee. It was awkward; we're both awkward sitting there and avoiding eye contact, so I suggested we walk around the store and look at books. That really broke the ice, and we figured out that we have a lot in common, in interests, politically, future plans. He already knew about the nonbinary thing and was fine with it. 

I remained reserved though. He'd moved back to the area three weeks ago and was job hunting. I hadn't yet told him about my lack of a libido or sexual attraction. What would he think of the fact that I made dildos for fun and was planning on doing it again in the future? I was wary of his future plans for children. Would my dog like him? The last was obviously the most important question. 

But we kept talking, meeting up twice a week thus far when it fits our schedules. He got an awesome job in his degree and he's well on his way to making it from an ""internship"" to a full time gig. He's happy to be with someone who is lowkey about sex. He doesn't care about the dildos. Finds my sense of humor to be great. My dog hasn't snapped once at him (and my dog is super messed up about strangers, so this is a big deal!). He likes me talking and being angry at my more conservative mother. 

Of course there are bumps. It turns out he's Type II Bipolar. Medicated, under control, but it's a speed bump when it comes my mother (she's a whole different entry, if I ever decide to hash *that* out). He drinks a lot of beer, but after sussing it out, it isn't actually that much (I'm just overly cautious when I drink), and even he admits he keeps an eye on the abv to keep from overdoing it. He has a list of medical issues a mile long. 

But just look at the list. Other than the beer, which he was honest about and so long as he doesn't drink more I'm fine with, all this stuff he really has little to no control over. Even with some of his depression and negative self imagery, he's admitted me talking to him has helped because I'm chock full of self-help from when I went to counseling and have been trying to focus on the positives.

When I think about him, I get all warm and happy inside. Spending time with him, talking to him, makes me happy. It's a way to get off the computer and be a human being, and we've talked about him meeting my dad as well as our future. A theoretical Plan A/B sort of deal where if we're still together in July we look at moving into a place together. This scares me.

I've always been fast to fall in love, and I've always been fast to see that, get scared, and run away. I'm trying not to do that with Sam because, well, I'm tired of that and after my engagement went belly side up, I want to be in a relationship that's just as much about me as it is the other person. And so far this is it. 

Now for the meat of the problem. I've heard statistically, I'm in the ""honeymoon"" stage of a relationship, where the other can do no wrong, and I hate it. I keep seeking for flaws and am finding very few. I don't want to keep having this emotional flip flop whenever we're together. 

The euphoria of a date lasts for about thirty minutes after I get home, then the fears start creeping in again. *Am I moving too fast? I'm moving too fast. This is going to end in failure. Don't tell him* I love you *yet. Wait for one of his lows in his emotional cycle and see if you can handle it. Can he handle your anxiety?* That sort of crap is running through my brain. I've not even asked if he'd like to be formerly dating with the whole ""boyfriend/whaterverIamfriend"" titles and everything. Saving it for a Halloween party the 29th. 

Am I making a mountain of a molehill? I've told him briefly how I can be a bit flighty, but that I'm working through it. I do really like this guy, and I know people move at different paces, but 18 days? Really? I either need reassurance that I'm not being an idiot or a reminder of reality to help me out, and thus far friends and family have been no help. So I turn to you reddit.

---

**tl;dr** I've recently started dating a guy who is basically on my wavelength about near everything we talk about, and we're really hitting it off. I plan on asking if he'd like to be my boyfriend on the 29th (23 days after we started seeing each other), but every time I leave a conversation or a date with him, my anxiety kicks in and I question if I'm moving too fast. Am I or am I trying to talk myself out of a potentially great thing?"
58svam,6,2016-10-22,The age old dilemma: I'm [21/M] in love with my best friend [23/F]. What do I do?,Throwaway196306,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/58svam/the_age_old_dilemma_im_21m_in_love_with_my_best/,"So as the title says I'm in the age old situation of that I've fallen in love with my best friend. The problem is that we live on two different sides of the world? 

How does that happen? I'm glad you asked.

At the start of 2014 we both moved into on-campus residence at college, me in my freshman year and her in her Junior year on exchange. We became fast friends despite me trying to be more at the very start and we fast became best friends. During the 6 months she was living in America we talked about any and everything, watched movies together and hung out whenever we could. We were inseparable.

This entire time I'm not trying to start anything romantically as she had told me a week after me met that ""We should just stay friends"" and so I've abide by that this. Even after her exchange was over and she went back to Australia we stayed in touched. We would skype often, facebook and any other means of communication. We were best friends.

She even came to visit in 2015 as a surprise as she always liked it here and had made so many friends and it was just like when we lived an on campus together just joking around and having a blast.
It was at this point that I started to realize that I had some serious feelings for her that were kind of always there. I didn't act on them as I didn't want to make it awkward or ruin what we had. 

Then later on that year she got some internship overseas in Europe and invited my to come stay with her and visit as a holiday for 2 weeks as she was willing to host. So I booked my flights after arranging the dates and flew out to her to have an adventure. As she was on placement she only had a small place and insisted that I take her bed and she take the couch while I was there (I used her apartment as a base of operations as she still had to work still while I was there so it was more probably every 2nd or 3rd night I had to crash while I was off exploring the other times). However as she had a huge bed and a tiny couch I said that I would take the couch as it was unfair considering she was working but it ended up just both of us in the bed in our underwear when I was there cause it was too hot but nothing ever romantic, just on separate sides. But cause of this we became more open and in the morning&amp;evenings would walk around in our underwear as we were bound to see anyway and may as well just get it over with. So I had my holiday in Europe and visited my bestfriend which was an absolute blast and we went back to being skype/facebook besties when I had to leave.

We've always been there for one another when the other needed somebody to rant to or just talk to late at night (or early morning depending on time difference).
Even some of our mutual friends agree that we're going to get married later on in life.

We tell each other we love one-another pretty much every time we talk too, but it seems more like a platonic love considering she said recently that I was one of her 'girl friends' she could always count on.

The problem is how do I proceed? I don't want to start a long distance relationship as we both know that won't work well and considering our current situations neither of us will be able to relocate for another 4 years or so. Or am I reading into this too much?

TL;DR: I've realized that I'm in love with my best friend who lives on the other side of the world and I don't know what to do or how to feel."

I'm doing an internship right now and it's going fine but something inside me just keeps crying out that this doesn't feel right. I know I need a job to survive but, to be honest, I need more than that, I need a career that I find interesting and is at least somewhat fulfilling and I'm not sure if web development fits that bill.

The problem is that I'm 33 now, and I should have settled on some sort of career but I haven't because I don't know what I'm good at or what my passion is. I wish I'd done more soul searching years ago like in college and tried some different things. Instead I settled on technology because that's the best field to go into at the time and I had at least some interest in it. I should also say that I have depression,almost no friends, and no love life to speak of, so that lack of a good social life has impacted me a lot too.

Still in spite of everything, I feel like there's still time to figure things out and that I don't want to go down another wrong road. Maybe I'm in denial and I don't have some destiny or undiscovered passion but I can shake these feelings that things just aren't right. That I'm on the wrong path.

How do I deal with these feelings in a constructive way? Is passion really the wrong thing to be looking for? Why do some people seem to have it and others don't? What's wrong with me?
 Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I have a story that I was only partially there for, but my ex girlfriend was present for the latter half. 

So, this was when I was much younger, in college. Im sure you could find this as it was in the news (local RI news) if you tried hunting for it.


 I was dating a girl that went to school in Providence, RI. It was the summer and everyone was back home. My girlfriend’s best friend had an internship back in Providence, and this girl had a 4 bedroom multi-family home to herself. The other 3 roommates were paying for their rooms but chose to stay home. I guess they could only get this place if they started paying rent 2-3 months prior to the school year starting, but whatever. 


One weekend my girlfriend asks me to go to Prov with her to spend time with her friend. She is lonely and has nothing to do on the weekends. We’re only like 1 hour from Providence so it sounds like a plan. We head down and we just chill for the night, drink, and do some cocaine. It’s about 2 AM and we decide to walk out and get some cigs, nothing special. We walk by a guy on our way home from the gas station who is just staring at us. Kind of creepy but no big deal, as its 2 AM in Providence and her house wasn’t located in the best of areas, but certainly not the worst. 


We eventually all pass out and me and my girlfriend head home the next day. The end of the week comes and my girlfriend asks if I want to go to Providence again, but I can’t, as I have to work all weekend, so I decline. She heads down there, and her friend’s boyfriend is coming to stay over. Pretty much a repeat of the weekend before - they all drink, but end up going out and partying a little bit. 


They are walking back after a night of drinking, when they enter the mudroom, around 2 AM. They close the mudroom door behind them (which was left unlocked) and there's a dude, really raggedy looking, in there, waiting for them. He says out loud to them “Get in the fucking house”. They all turn around and he has a gun. My girlfriend’s friend has already unlocked the door to the house and it’s partially opened. Everyone is frozen in place, and the guy repeats himself “Get in the fucking house!”. 


The boyfriend then steps forward with his hands up a little bit, as to not seem confrontational, and says “hey man, calm down, it's all good”. I don’t know how the fuck this dude was brave enough to do any of this. As he says that, the dude SHOOTS HIM. 


My girlfriend and her friend run into the house and hide under a bed. They can’t hear this, but the assailant took off, and didn’t follow them back in. They don’t know this though, and are terrified, hiding under a bed, while the boyfriend is screaming for help. They think the psycho has come into the house and is looking for them. My girlfriend told me they were both silently crying under the bed while the boyfriend screamed for help, and, this is the worst part, yelling out “help me, Im dying”. 


The neighbors heard the gunshot and screaming and called the police. They ended up catching the dude. 


He had been watching the girl for weeks. It was the guy we had seen watching us the week prior. Worst part was, the girl’s boyfriend ended up dying. 

**UPDATE** 

A user messaged me with some info, and added a comment with it, but I'm going add this to the post. Again this was 8-9 years ago, and I can't find anything with a google search, but with this info and the timeframe maybe some internet sleuths can dig something up:

""Yes, I remember when that happened, I believe its right off Broadway.. on Courtland Street, right by the gas station. My friends had just moved into an apartment around the corner. If I'm not mistaken my current co-worker lives in this house with her boyfriend, they got a little bit of a deal but didnt realize why until after they moved in.. there's still blood stains in the hallway."""

How strong is it in terms of the availability of jobs and internships in software/tech companies upon graduation? Since Pullman is not a very big city, do CS graduates face difficulties finding software jobs, as there are not many tech companies in/around the area?

I have heard many people praise the program but they say that the location could be a disadvantage when it comes to jobs since Pullman doesn't enjoy the advantages that, for example, Seattle does, in terms of the number of tech companies like Microsoft, Amazon etc.

Is this true? What is the job scenario like for CS graduates? Do enough tech companies visit the campus to recruit or are students mostly on their own?"

Sarah and I were the most unlikely of best friends. She was your typical white girl, born and raised in the exurbs of a major city with both her parents making six figures. I was born and raised in that city, the son of immigrants and the only brown kid hanging out with the black kids. But we both ended up attending our state college where we had the same major and so ended up in the same class freshman year. We became friends when out of sheer randomness we were placed in the same group for a project where we ended up doing all the work.

Sarah and I kept having classes together and we started studying together and found that we absolutely killed it when we worked together. However, outside of class we were completely different. She joined a professional fraternity for our major while I joined the school's rugby team. She hadn't drank until college and now only drank wine; I smoked weed all the time. I was outgoing yet blunt and she was shy and could come off as sassy and bossy. I listened to rap, she couldn't stand it. So you get the point.
Sarah ended up dating one of my friends named David and I started started dating someone too. So we went on plenty of double dates and we would also have movie and board game nights with the 4 of us where the guys would smoke and drink beer while the girls drank wine. Sarah and I also became each others' go to for relationship advice and that of course extended into our sex lives. It turns out that David had a low sex drive and was also repulsed by oral, both giving and receiving. I also knew that David was a little paranoid and always wore a condom, even though Sarah had been wanting to try it raw for a while. David was Sarah's first and having recently discovered sex, she wanted to experiment which David was against. Meanwhile, my sex with my girlfriend was lively to say the least and it seemed like Sarah got a bit of enjoyment from hearing about it.

Anyways fast forward to this past summer. Sarah and I both got internships and were living a few blocks away from each other near campus. It had been a rough start to the summer for Sarah as her best friend had died in a car crash and her and David went through a rough patch and the stress had caused them to go through a messy breakup. I tried to be there to support her but she went back to her family for a few days and with work getting in the way, the next time I saw her was in the gym on a Friday in July. By that time, I had broken up with my girlfriend as well. We caught up and she said that she was doing fine and that she was enjoying work. As we were about to go our separate ways, Sarah says to me, ""Hey do you wanna come over for movie night?"" ""Just me and you?"" I ask. ""Yeah it's a fun tradition, we should keep it going,"" she says. ""Sounds good to me.""

I got home and not gonna lie, I thought I would be getting laid, but I knew I didn't wanna initiate. So I showered, trimmed, rolled a couple blunts and packed condoms just in case. I get to Sarah's place and she opens the door. She's wearing sweatpants and T-shirt with a beanie, her typical outfit. We throw on Mean Girls for what has to be at least the 10th time and sit on the couch. I spark up and she sips her glass of wine. About an hour in, I'm sitting upright with my feet on her coffee table and she's laying down with her head in my lap. As I'm about to light up my 2nd blunt I hear, ""Hey can I get a hit?""
""What!?! I thought you hated weed?"" ""I'm trying to do new things this summer,"" said Sarah. So I teach her how to take a hit and to my surprise she takes it like a champ. We end up splitting the blunt and Sarah kept drinking wine to stop the coughing, getting too cross-faded in the process and falling asleep in my lap. When the movie finishes, I nudge her awake. ""Hey Sarah do you wanna get some dinner or should I go?""

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Still rubbing the sleep from her bloodshot eyes, she finally responds with ""Yeah let's get from that Chinese place across the street."" As she finally sits up, she suddenly turns towards me and says, ""Flash, do you think I'm pretty?"" What a loaded fucking question! ""Uhhh yeah,"" I respond, ""you're pretty good looking."" ""Thanks, Flash, that means a lot."" I nod and turn away to grab my phone. As I turn back, I see Sarah's face less than an inch from mine. After a moment of hesitation, we both go in for the kiss.

Sarah kissed me with surprising force, a little sloppy even, but we soon settled into a steady rhythm as she straddled me, making it easier for us to feel up each other's bodies. I could feel Sarah's surprise when I grabbed her ass, which was unexpectedly plump for her petite 5'4"" frame. We moved down to kissing each other's necks when Sarah whispers in my ear, ""Flash I want to have sex with you."" ""Are you sure Sarah? Do you really want to do this?"" ""Flash, fuck me like you did Emma(my ex)""

That was all I needed to hear. I pulled her shirt off over her head and undid her bra, revealing a milky pale body and small B cup breasts. I started teasing her, grabbing one and flicking its nipple while my tongue made circles around the other one. I looked up at Sarah just as I was about to put her nipple in my mouth. Her eyes were closed and she was biting her lip. As her gaze met mine she pushed my head into her breasts, I took her nipple in my mouth and flicked it all over with my tongue as Sarah started dry humping me. I switched nipples and pinched one while I bit the other lightly and small sexy squeal of surprise left her lips.

She took off my shirt and felt my body, standing up herself. She kissed from my neck down to my abs till she got to my shorts. As she was about to pull them down, I picked her up and threw her over my shoulder. I wasn't much taller than her but I had a stocky defined body and it wasn't hard to throw her on her immaculately made bed. She started giggling so I pounced on her and pulled her sweatpants off, turning her on her stomach in the process. I grabbed her plump asscheeks and gave them a nice squeeze and then a rough slap, making Sarah moan, which she muffled by grabbing a pillow and burying her face in. I peeled her thong off too and flipped her onto her back again.

I bent down and got my glimpse of her pussy. It was an ""innie"" with a little bit of plumpness to it and she had a little bit of hair that was neatly trimmed into a triangle. I laid down on my stomach with my face in between her legs. Her bed was starting to get wet and I could easily see the strings of wetness as I got closer. I started kissing her inner thighs and lightly massaging her small clit with my thumb eliciting more moans. Just before I dove in, I stopped, looked up and smirked at her. She rolled her eyes, grabbed my hair and shoved my head into her crotch.

She tried to yell but it was more of a ""fuuuuuuuuuu"" that trailed off into a moan that Sarah snuffed with her pillow again. My tongue was going crazy in her tight little pussy, flicking and licking and pleasuring whatever was in its reach. Sarah was going wild too because she kept a tight grip on my hair, and kept shoving my head in, but all I could hear was ""Yes,yesyesyesyesyesyes,"" and then a high pitched moan as she came. Her body quivered and I made sure to keep my tongue in her pussy, sending another wave of pleasure through her.

Sarah finally let go of my hair and I pushed up. ""That was the first time anyone's ever gone down on me,"" she said. ""No way!"" I replied. She lay there for another couple of seconds, her wetness having gotten through her sheets already. ""Your turn,"" I said and I lay down on my back next to her, my cock harder than it's been in a while. Sarah slowly got on her knees and crawled over to me, and pulled my shorts and boxers off. ""I've never done this before either,"" she said. I started to respond, ""don't wor-"" when she took my head into her mouth and shut me up.

Not gonna lie, Sarah was lacking technique but she was very open to instruction and made up for it with sheer effort. She eventually got a really good rhythm going and started taking me deeper and deeper until she gagged hard. She looked up at me with tears in her eyes and smiled. ""Your turn,"" she said and giggled as she lay down next to me.

I got up over her and took my condoms out of my shorts. ""I want to feel you without one,"" said Sarah. ""If you say so,"" I replied and positioned my head to enter her wet pussy. I paused again and looked at Sarah and we started making out again. I pushed into her and she tried to moan but it was muffled by our kissing. She wrapped her legs around me and slid herself further down my penis. Her pussy was crazy wet and it was tight as well. We started out slow and rhythmic, working my whole length into her, never stopping kissing each other. We pulled away finally and giggled at each other, which I cut short by suddenly slamming myself into her. Sarah started to scream out in pleasure but I put a hand over her mouth and continued pounding her. After a few more strokes, her eyes rolled back and I started gyrating inside her which brought forth more moans muffled by my hand and a quivering orgasm for her.

Her legs were still wrapped around me and I was still inside her. I picked her up and we got off the bed. I pushed her against the wall and I started fucking her again. ""Fuck me harder,"" she moaned and started kissing me again. I did so, coming out as far as possible on each stroke and pushing in with enough force to rattle the things on top of her dresser. I pulled away from her lips and started choking her lightly as I kept fucking her. ""I'm cumming,"" she managed to moan as she started to shake again.

I sat down on edge of the bed, still inside Sarah, and laid back. She fell on top of me and we started making out again until she stopped quivering. We sat back up and Sarah got up and turned around and gave me a little teasing butt jiggle. She lowered herself down onto me again and started giving me a lap dance of sorts. Her ass was plump for her frame and it was the palest part of her body, with a cute little asshole that would wink at me every few strokes. I grabbed her hair and pulled her head close to my face. ""Can you cum inside me, Flash?"" she asked. ""Fuck I would love to Sarah."" Her birth control alarm had gone off during the movie and I had seen her take it so I wasn't worried there.

She started lowering her ass down on my cock, and after a single stroke, started slamming it as I pushed into her and pulled her hair. I wasn't going to last much longer. ""Sarah I'm going to cum soon."" She pulled off of me and said ""not yet"" and turned around and straddled me on the edge of the bed. We started kissing again as she bounced on me. I had her ass in my hands and I licked a finger and started rubbing around her asshole as I started fucking her harder. ""I'm gonna cum, Sarah,"" I said right before I pushed into her as far as possible. I started shooting my cum deep in her pussy as we started making out again. Sarah started to have her own orgasm and started quivering again. I stuck my finger into her asshole, just down to the first knuckle and her quivers turned into lower body shakes. We pulled away and looked at each other and smiled and laughed. We fell back onto her bed, my finger still in her ass, and started making out again as her body finished up it's orgasms.

We made out for about another 5 minutes, when Sarah pulled away and said, ""hey, you're still really hard."" ""Oh shit, that happens when I'm high."" ""Wellllllll, do you think you can go again?"" This was easily the best sex that I've ever had so of course I said ""yeah I think so."" ""Good,"" she said, ""can you fuck my ass this time?"" That question blew my mind. Here was Sarah, a goody two shoes with a prissy attitude, talking like a nympho. I took my finger out of her ass finally and put it near her face, mostly as a joke. She met my eyes and took my whole finger in her mouth, never breaking eye contact. She ended up gagging on that too which made me laugh. ""Shut up,"" she said as she got off me and my cum started flowing out of her pussy onto the bed and floor. ""Fuck,"" she exclaimed and got some towels to clean up.

She came back to me, who had moved to now be laying on my back on the bed. I had my eyes closed, replaying what just happened. I fucked my best friend! And it was amazing sex! All of a sudden, I feel something on my balls and I quickly open my eyes to find Sarah licking them, making sure to get our cum off. ""Take one in your mouth, suck it a little,"" I told her. And she did, as I held her hair up. When she stopped, she lay down on her stomach next to me. ""Fuck my ass,"" she said in a more commanding tone this time.

I got up and spread her cheeks. Her asshole was small and puckered tight, but it was wet from all our cum. I started teasing it with a finger again but this time I grabbed her ass and stuck my tongue into it. Sarah moaned and reached back and grabbed my hair again, and shoved me even deeper. I licked as deep as I could as Sarah moaned into a pillow. She finally let go of me and I got up and kneeled. Sarah followed my lead and we set up in doggie.

I started slowly, pushing my head in. Sarah gasped then moaned as I slowly managed to fit more of myself in her ass. ""Tell me when to stop,"" I said. She never did, and I was balls deep in Sarah's plump little ass. I reached around and started massaging her clit. This brought on another round of orgasms, and she started shaking harder. I made sure to stay as deep as possible. Sarah looked back at me and had tears in her eyes again, but her face was that of pure ecstasy. Her ass was tighter than her pussy and I knew I wasn't going to last long. We slowly started fucking as Sarah moaned and screamed simultaneously. After a few more strokes, I came again and reached around and grabbed her tits and flicked her nipples as I shot my load into her ass this time.

I pulled out, and a globs of cum fell out of Sarah's ass. I went to get a towel for it when she pushed me down onto the bed again and said, ""we're not done yet."" I was still rock hard and Sarah brought her pussy over my face and took my cock in her mouth. I loved 69ing and started licking her pussy like a wild man, alternating between flicking her clit with my tongue and trying to fuck her with it. Sarah was slowly taking more and more of me in her mouth while playing and massaging my balls. I had never felt better. I didn't think I could, but I came again, this time deep into Sarah's mouth as she gagged hard, but still kept me in her mouth, and never stopped playing with my balls. When she decided she was done, she licked me clean and lay on my chest. Neither of us said anything, we just looked at each other and smiled as we went to sleep.

58vqf2,0,2016-10-22,(Atlanta) Buying the fixer-upper home I'm renting...,purchasemybutt,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/58vqf2/atlanta_buying_the_fixerupper_home_im_renting/,"I am 27 and have been renting a house for about 1.5 years now and it needs significant work. I really like this house though, the layout, the yard, the location, the neighbors, all of it. The neighborhood is one of those that is about to start being very valuable I believe. It was hit hard in the recession and my landlord paid $25k for it back in 2008 according to records. He basically got it rentable, but that was it. The 2 house accross the street were abandoned for almost 5 years until last year they (and others on my street) were all picked up and remodeled and sold for around $200k. Nearby neighborhoods (&lt;2mi away) are going through their ascention now. 

But this house... there are a lot of things that are going to be serious issues. The plumbing is falling apart (all leaky CPVC), the basement has a serious flooding issues (the yard is to blame mostly), the electricals are probably going to be an issue at inspection, the HVAC needs serious attention, and the windows are all the same windows from the 60's so the insulation is attrocious. 

Now with all that said, I really like this house. I'll be in atlanta at least for 4+ more years with no problem of staying. I have a very stable job in a good industry making about $55k a year with advancement and promotions possible. My gf currently lives with me and is in school but will be out in 1.5 years; we expect her to be well employed. We aren't married so she wouldn't be involved finacially, but all signs point that we'll get married after her graduation (def not before) and will definitely contribute to mortgage when she's living here regardless of our marriage situation.

I have about $25k in student loans, $2k in CC debt (not a big issue I could pay this off now but I get 0% apr). I have about $3k in savings along with 2 motorcycles that I could definitely sell for ~5k$ (but I'd rather not). The home is valued by Zillow at $150k but I know for a fact that's a huge overestimate. I would be prepared to offer $90k to start and be willing to go up to $120k. I know I don't have the 20%, but PMI isn't going to be much on such a low valued house I expect. And once the GF starts bringing in real money (not internship money) then we can tackle the mortgage head on. I haven't been preapproved for a loan because this is still in consideration state, but my credit score is &gt;750. I think he'll bite because he's not equipped to handle this house. He kinda got in over his head buying up properties. He's always asking my opinions and giving me rent breaks to do the labor. 

I expect to be able to handle (and have been handling) all of the things that are wrong with the house indefinitely. I am handy enough to do 90% of plumbing and about 50% of the electrical with friends/support for what I can't do. 

Is there anythign I'm missing? Should I reconsider something. My dad says not to think about the investment much and that the absolute best to hope for is to break even when I sell it. I think that's wise, and in that respect I think it's a fairly safe investment. I'm worried I don't have enough of a down payment, but I don't really want to wait very long to act. I have a rental agreement for 2 more years and I think he's hoping I'll stay longer.

I want to do a lot though, I want to renovate the basement and make it into a livable area and a workshop for my bikes. I want to build a deck, I want to replace the windows, and I want to make the yard my own. It has so much potential I think. I also like the idea of doing business with my landlord - I know this house inside and out (lol). I know him, and he knows me. He can avoid most closing costs, we can avoid realtors in general, we can just do this as an arms length transaction. 

Except I hate being tied to property. I hate the idea that I can't move away from Atlanta if I decide to, and I hate the idea of having this huge huck of wood and dirt that I can't move. Home ownership kind of scares me, and honestly 2 years ago I would have never considered it and was pretty against it. 

I've thought about it for about a month now and I definitely ***want*** to do it. So now I'm in the actual consideration stages and want to get some opinions. 

Does anyone thing my pricing is off? Zillow is very often wrong, but I know the neighborhood and it seems right. The abandoned houses sold for about ~$50k and resold for ~$200k. It seems reasonable that the non-abanonded but dilapadated house would sell for ~$100k. 

What about my finances? Am I silly to go with such a low down payment? 

Anything else?

58vzxg,32,2016-10-22,Third Tier Reality (Long Post),LawLawThrow,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/58vzxg/third_tier_reality_long_post/,"I go to a law school ranked 80-90 with about a 55% employment score. Do I think my quality of education is bad? No. However, I think the main difference between my school and a better school is the feel you have knowing that, out of any three students, one is going to get a good/decent job, one is getting a shitjob that won’t pay back their loans, and one isn’t get hired anywhere. PIA, government, firms, whatever. I wrestled in undergrad, and there are days where it feels like you just got out of a double-overtime match. The grades matter, the softs matter, everything matters because you know there’s way more falling bodies than trampolines to save them. 

Also, remember that the employment score is likely bolstered by people who I call “immediate connectors.” These are people with serious connections that guarantee a job, not just the typical dude who knows a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy he can send his resume to. These people bolster the employment score, but aren’t actually an indicator of the school’s ability to place its graduates. Just to toss some anecdotal examples out there, there’s a person in my class who transferred in from Charlotte School of Law. Her third time in the actual building, she went through OCIs and got swiped up by the biggest firm there. Come to find out, her dad is a bigshot partner there. The fix was in the whole time. Another person’s uncle is a damn US Senator and has a job locked up for that person in DC after law school. I can name at least 8 more in my 100ish-person law school class. One girl who is mega-connected couldn’t get in, so she went to a shittier law school within driving distance of a beach in another state. She got a really coveted internship at a large firm back in our state. That’s one less job off the table and she didn’t even have to interview for it.
Hell, there is one kid at my school whose nickname is literally “Sloppy” because he has no social skills or personal hygiene. He dresses like Johnny Knoxville in The Ringer, his hands are constantly in his pants, and his finger is always at least up to the second knuckle in his nose. Several students unknowingly sit next to him on the first day then move because it’s so damn nasty. Kid just has no self-awareness of how gross he is. He’ll roll up in the first row of a class, pull out his laptop, and play WoW or LoL during the whole class while everyone looks down on his row and watches him do it. BUT his dad is one of the most respected lawyers in the state and his mom is a very accomplished prosecutor. His smelly ass is going to get a job working with one of them and sucking up their overhead until the ‘rents retire/kick it and Lil’ Sloppy’s grossness/laziness runs off all the clients it took dad and mom years to build. Or working for someone they have leaned on until that employer realizes that he’s literally the Pokemon Grimer and no favor in the 80s is worth having this tub pick his nose while giving his chair a mowhawk all day. Lil’ Sloppy knows he’s safe and isn’t shy about telling people, either. I remember he totally whiffed on his 1L memo and was just like “Yeah, this doesn’t matter. When I’m working my dad will just teach me how to do it right.” He’s like Boss Tweed in Gangs of New York: some of us hate him, but you can’t help but admire him. He just sorta gives the finger to all the bullshit law school is trying to throw at him.

I don’t blame these people for their connections (hell, I wish I had more), but you should understand what they mean. They’re sucking up a job that you honestly don’t have a chance of getting. It doesn’t matter how well you outline for Seagull Torts and write on for the International Dogbite Law Journal, the firm is looking to fill one spot and you aren’t beating out the partner’s kid. That’s less trampolines catching those falling bodies.

It’s frustrating especially because there are no solid criteria for what gets you a job, so you never get the feeling that you’re safe until your offer is in hand. The number one kid in the class is set, but I know the number five (with LR and a ton of mock trial stuff) kid is looking and can’t find shit. Number 3 kid is working as a state court clerk making as much as a dental hygienist but with much more debt. At the same time, there are some lower ranked kids with good job offers because they hustled their ass off. It’s a shotgun blast if you aren’t an immediate connector and you never know when you’re going to get gunned down or be left standing. Grades correlate to employment, but it’s a rough correlation and a bunch of people who deserve it get left out in the cold. 

Because of this, you have to maximize your odds by just jumping on everything that makes you look better if you don’t get picked up for OCI’s or, alternatively, to look better for OCIs. Mock trials, moot court, network like crazy, attend every bar meeting, spend an ungodly amount of time in the clinic, outline and bust your ass for grades, strain for that unpaid externship in another town which will require taking out yet ANOTHER loan but may catch someone’s eye so you can sup from that trough of sweet, sweet employment. Looking at it, it is totally normal to question why you’re there. Doing all that stuff takes up a ton of time and, most of the time, doesn’t end up helping.

What’s also shockingly noticeable are the people who are just refusing reality and are not hustling to get jobs even though it is 3L spring and that student loan hammer is just WAITING to crush them. I saw one dude in our class (probably in the top 10%, mind you) who said he put off looking for jobs pretty much all of January/February because he is the head of our school’s trial association and his time has been preoccupied organizing the school’s in-house trial competition. Later, I find out that another student plucked a sweet Federal Magistrate Clerkship that I know the dude wanted but never got around applying to because he was running his mock trial shit. Like, wtf. Nothing should get in the way of job hunting, but especially not some dumb student org. However, it’s like he didn’t want to prioritize. Looking for jobs was scary while holding onto his authority (LO fucking L) as a class officer was comforting. You should be doorbusting career services, not focusing 100% of your energy on the Women’s Law Association bake-sale. 

You see shit like that out of 3Ls all the time at this level and, honestly, the psychology is fascinating. Just straight-up denial of trying to find a job. You can tell they’ve never been put in that position before, where putting your head down and mumbling “I don’t know” isn’t an acceptable answer. These are people who have been smart and capable their entire lives and just aren’t computing that the transition from law school-to-work isn’t as smooth as the transition from undergrad-to-law school. There’s no magic standardized test score they can reach that will end with someone handing a job to them on a silver platter like there is with a really high LSAT score. It’s like someone put Valium in the water or something. I think this is why there are some lower ranked students snatching up what little jobs are available. The brains are gunshy. The top-of-class-but-unemployed group is just shellshocked that no one is handing them a job while the lower-ranked dudes are used to having shit thrown violently back in their faces and aren’t afraid to keep jamming their faces in the “Bob For Apples In Shit” bucket until they come up with that Sweet Granny Smith between their teeth.

If this seems depressing, well, it is. It’s fucking real depressing. It seems crazy on most forums because all but a few 1Ls just can’t grasp it while their busting out all the cannons of construction for International Shoe. Realizing that you can do everything right and still lose is shocking to some people. I’m a 3L and things “worked out” for me. I got offered a Federal Magistrate Clerkship through OCIs my 1L summer, got picked up by another OCI firm my 2L summer, and then that firm offered me beginning of 3L year. However, I am aware that one misstep, one bad bounce and I’m back to being a falling body with no certain trampoline.
So, would I recommend a school of this caliber to someone who isn’t an immediate connector (for those of you that are, it doesn’t matter which school so at least pick a cheap one in a nice location)? No. Absolutely not. It just isn’t worth it. But if someone insisted, I’d tell them to prepare for a fight. I’d tell them that you can fucking taste the stress and anxiety in the halls on some days.

I am 6'2, 185 pounds, I am a runner who also does weightlifting.

You like to dress business slutty. Tight dress, high heels, dressed shirts that highlight your assets.

From day 1, you noticed that man, the director of the department, me. You also saw me looking at you a few times, in the elevator, or while you passed by my office. You love the attention, you would like to get that powerful, married man for you.

Through the first few weeks of your internship, you had to produce some reports for me, or complete ad-hoc request. Each time, you would come to my desk, touch my arm, lean towards me to show your cleavage, tease me. Often, you would go straight to the restroom right after and masturbate.

Now today I asked you for a tedious ad-hoc request that you just completed. Earlier that day, you came by my office a few times and I've never been so obvious about watching you.

It's late, 8pm, and the whole office is empty except us two. You're extremely horny and you want to see if this can get further. What do you do?"

58wx2a,5,2016-10-22,Lazy/symbolic forth and macros,reepca,Forth,https://www.reddit.com/r/Forth/comments/58wx2a/lazysymbolic_forth_and_macros/,"EDIT: Due to lack of a preview feature in reddit (at least, one that I can see / know about), I did not realize I had written an essay until I posted this. So I apologize if it's a bit long - I can't really think of a good tl;dr. Sorry.

So it's always struck me as a little odd that the name of a word to be defined comes after the word that's defining it. The entire idea behind an operand stack is that words operate on what was placed on the stack earlier by other words, right? And yet here we are with the name being provided syntactically after the word that uses it. So I thought to myself, what if names that the outer interpreter sees that aren't numbers or already have a definition associated with them are pushed on the stack as a string? A bit of thought shows that this really doesn't work: what if you want to redefine an already-defined word? Or what if you want to define words with numbers as names (not so surprising if you're working in a base higher than 10)? So that isn't going to work. Of course, we could just use s"" to pass a string there, but it doesn't feel like a very natural syntax, using strings for basic syntax. So what's to be done?

Off in another portion of my mind, something has been nagging at me: Forth has semantic macros. What I mean is that instead of macros taking syntax as input and producing different syntax as output that could have already been made, macros *directly* use the compiler to achieve what the new syntax would have indicated. And I think that's a good thing. It's really cool to be able to do that. But it's a bit difficult to make *syntactic* macros - and as a paper I recently read pointed out, ""notation matters"". What would a postfix syntactic macro even look like? Presumably it would have to operate on the syntax in front of it. This is not something that Forth currently seems suited to.

And so we get to the topic of this post: Yet Another Investigation into Altering Forth. I don't know why I and many others are so interested in trying to change Forth when we already think it's a really cool language - perhaps we just get easily excited about these sorts of things. Learning about vastly different ways of doing things is exciting, and it makes one hopeful about what more they may yet learn. I don't think that hope is a bad thing, but knowing how different things have already become for the better, it becomes harder to accept anything if I think it can be improved.

Anyway, enough trying to justify my thinking about this. Right now my solution seems to be to change the way the outer interpreter works. Fair warning, I have not tried to implement these ideas. I apologize if there's some major snag just waiting to be run into and I haven't thought of it. So suppose that the outer interpreter, instead of by default executing any word it sees, just interns it (think like READ from Lisp if that helps) and leaves that symbol on the stack. Well, I think it would probably be a lot easier to work with if it was kept in some sort of array, actually. So maybe there could be a separate symbol stack. Or a separate symbol queue. The point is, something that fits what we want to do with these symbols. Okay, that's great and all, but how would we actually get stuff done if all the outer interpreter is doing is storing symbols? My answer to that is immediate words, but not as you know them. Immediate words would instead execute... well... immediately. So suppose I had an ""immediate"" word named NOW!.

    2 2 + . NOW!

would print 4. But how would NOW! be implemented? There are two ways I can think of. The first is to just go from earliest symbol to latest symbol, fetching the associated xt and executing it. The second is a lot more complicated, but also somewhat more interesting. It involves the question of ""what is an expression in Forth""?

I first saw the term ""expression"" used in relation to Forth in larsbrinkhoff's forth-mode, where C-M-b was to ""move backwards one expression"". Currently that just moves back one word unless the cursor is in front of a ;, in which case it moves to the balanced : - that is, it moves back one definition. In Lisp, an ""expression"" would be anything that is self-evaluating, like `NIL` or `25` or `""hi""` or else a list with an operator as its first element followed by other expressions, like `(+ 2 2)`. In infix languages, the discussion of what an expression is rather confusing so I try to avoid it. My personal way of thinking of an expression in forth is as a single word plus any words whose results it depends on. So `."" hi there!"" 2 2 + .`, looked at from the right, has two expressions: the `.` which depends on the `+` which depends on both `2`s and the `.""` expression. So if I wanted to evaluate a single expression from the right, I would stop before evaluating `.""`. And I had something in my head about how I could use a concept similar to page faulting, only call it stack faulting, and so use a sort of lazy evaluation to evaluate a single expression. Except that wouldn't even work intuitively because `2 somevar ! somevar @ EVAL-EXPRESSION` wouldn't be guaranteed to get 2. So I think I'll stop talking about that one now. Still, it's an interesting question: what is an expression in Forth?

So it looks like `NOW!` would best be implemented as simply evaluating all the words entered up until now (which is why I'm not sure it should be implemented as a stack, unless it can easily be reversed?). Would numbers be counted as symbols, and trying to get their xt would instead just give an xt that will give that number when executed, or would that be handled at a higher level? So anyway, that's one way that should work to actually do stuff. But it's not the only way to do stuff. And a lot of interesting opportunities open up.

To go back to the earlier example of a word being defined, we now could say `0 ZERO CONSTANT` and have `CONSTANT` be an ""immediate"" word. 

We could also play games with our syntax. Suppose that ] is a word that looks back through the symbols until it finds [ and then executes the words from [ to itself, and suppose that we can still somehow access the structure the symbols are stored in as if it was a stack. Then we could do this:

    2 2 + 3 * [ symswap sym&gt; symswap &gt;sym symswap ] NOW!

and have 7. It's not a particularly useful example, but it seems neat to me. I'm reminded of [this xkcd](https://xkcd.com/184/).

One thing I've noticed is that without some sort of context it's hard to use this sort of stuff without it being really brittle. It would be a lot more useful to be able to swap two expressions around than to swap two symbols. But I can see that if I start putting parentheses or some similar delimiter of context around expressions I'm going to very quickly get a reverse-polish Lisp. Which wouldn't be too bad, but it's not really what I'm aiming for. So let me ask: is it possible to ""infer"" expressions, perhaps using a static stack analyzer (assuming variable stack depths are banned)? Even if it was possible, would it be a good thing? These kinds of macros look neat and all, but they could very quickly make code unreadable. 

For example, suppose that I had written some code that did something with cells that it wanted to treat as people. And when you have a person on the stack and you say `HAPPY` it replaces that person on the stack with a happy one (however that is represented). But you think to yourself, `HAPPY PERSON` would look much more english-like than `PERSON HAPPY`. So you make `PERSON` an immediate word that puts a word with some sort of `HAPPY` implementation before `PERSON`. Sure it looks nicer, I guess, but it's not really more understandable. No longer is it executing left-to-right top-to-bottom. Similarly, I'm not sure how readable providing names in a postfix fashion would be.

    : &gt;r begin dup while dup r@ execute @ repeat r&gt; 2drop    dolist ;

I'm not sure if that would be more or less ""naturally"" readable or if it's just something that would take getting used to. 

Are any of the effects of these ideas good? Are there implementation problems I haven't thought of? What do you think?"

I don't know, I figured it couldn't hurt to ask?

At any rate, I'm a recent (well, May) CS graduate from a small private university in the Midwest. Kansas City, more specifically. I had a pretty good GPA, some small projects, but no internships. I say mid-transition but, basically, I pass 100% but my legal name isn't changed yet and I also haven't been able to change my gender marker. Since graduating, I've just had zero luck in landing an interview - it's like I'm sending my resume into the void. The recent grad aspect is definitely working against me, especially since it seems like all the job postings here are looking for people with 3-5+ years of work experience. However, I kind of feel like the my legal status might be throwing people off, so I mention it as well.

I'm not sure what I'm looking for here, just...advice for people who work in software engineering and other tech related positions? And stories from people who've managed to land jobs without their legal information changed? I'm trying not to get discouraged, but it gets harder and harder the longer I'm unemployed. I could definitely use some inspiring stories."
58xha3,6,2016-10-23,Things I've Learned,LoveCorgis93,ExNoContact,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/58xha3/things_ive_learned/,"My ex dumped me back in May. At this point - a little over 5 months ago. 
During the time - Both my laptops crashed during Finals week of college, my bike got stolen forcing me out of work at one of my jobs, and my graduation ceremony was around the corner, which I really wanted her to attend but she could not due to mom giving birth to yet Another child.

*Summary*
Long Distance Ex dumped me. Attempted no contact. Relatively successful with the Not Contacting part, failed at not social media stalking every now and then. Now that we are in the same state, attempting to be friends. Friendship is not possible if both parties have different expectation of said friendship. If one person is still in Love, that friendship will inevitably be unhealthy.
**************************************************

Important note - We were long distance with sparse visits for about 3 years (High School puppy-love type of thing)



**Body**

Over the past summer I finished one of my final semesters of college. The majority of the summer was No Contact or very minimal contact at all. Really did not have much time to think about her as I kept myself busy with my job(s), schoolwork, and hanging out with friends and people part of my graduating class before everyone would inevitably leave at the end of the summer. So, having a pretty productive summer did not have much time to worry or think about her. (Of course, I did, but it wasn't as impactful as it is now)

**Fast Forward to September 

I'm back home from College for what I assumed to be good, however, just got an email from my department chair saying I have to come back to retake a class in order to get the degree. 
I meet up with the ex and we agree to be just friends. We both missed each other a lot so I figured ""Well, I survived a summer without her being in my life hardly at all so I can do this no problem. I have PROVEN to myself I do not need her to be a part of my life.""

**And now, alas, we're in October

When I meet up with her next, I will probably just have to tell her I can't do this friendship thing solely because I'm still In love with her, as well as do still love her. She knows this. I know this. We are both holding onto a friendship that we know is not possible deep down unless we're together. However, with her joining the Air Force Reserves, and me going back to Boston in January, we both know a relationship will be Exactly the same as how it was - which was the sole cause of the breakup; we were both sick of the distance. We had a similar talk earlier where as although I was being 100% transparent, this friendship is not going to work no matter how much I want it to and cherish it. Whenever we talk on the phone, text, hang out, it is always the same thing - falling back in love with her again... or better, Allowing myself to do so because of the lack of distance I am giving myself. (The breakup wasn't bad.)

**Side Note About The Breakup 

The timing was just horrible for both of us. 
The ""distance"" part of Long Distance was seemingly never going to end.
The financial strain was becoming overwhelming to both of us. 
Hm. No. The financial strain wasn't the problem.
The problem was we were both suffocating each other emotionally. I was her best friend, boyfriend, lover, support system, almost everything all at once from multiple states away, and her to me. We both knew somewhere that this was unhealthy. However, me being in College constantly surrounded by a large variety of people, it was a lot easier for me to find support and disperse negative energy in a positive fashion. That being said, at the end of the day when we would get a chance to actually talk to each other, we were both completely drained, physically, mentally and emotionally. Phone calls were very rarely fun. She was stressed with home-life and her job. I was stressed with by far the hardest semester I've faced in college, paying rent, flat out NOT being able to visit at all (first time in 3 years I just could NOT visit for a prolonged period of time) and the mood was just overall shitty. The thing keeping everything together was the hope that we will eventually be able to be together and be a normal couple - to get things back to how they used to be without all the additional stress Long Distance amplifies* 

From my point of view - I am known to be overly harsh on people, including myself. Since the start of October, I have been working on positive self-talk, and making many positive changes. Working out being one of them, (although I am clearly not doing it correctly because my arms are killing me ???) reminding myself of my love of music (I allowed College to beat it out of me. Just needed a break.), (still) applying for jobs. However, I will be back in College to retake one final class this coming January. 

Throughout the entire relationship, I always insisted that she focus on developing a sense of individuality and independence when it comes to pretty much everything in her life.
Very clearly remember getting in an argument with her telling her that it is MUCH more important to prioritize Herself, to Invest in Herself, to invest in a Career because a Career means Job(s), over a relationship, with me, or anyone, at this stage of life because say the relationship ends - then what do you have?  A broken heart with far too little investment in yourself. 
Very vividly remember that argument changing the dynamics of the relationship a bit. 
However, to this day, I meant 100% everything I said.
I know, I have seen, so many of my friends, guys and girls, whom get into relationships and then neglect theirselves. Girl gets married to her husband who has a career - Husband ALLOWS girl to do that. Girl then complains constantly about not being happy with her choices. What m8???

Guy enables his girlfriend not to strive for the best she can,
Girl settles for something that wasn't really what she wanted in terms of guy, career, whatever.

I told myself and her I'd be damned if I allow her, or any future girlfriend of mines, to not continually strive to be the best version of herself. 

So yes - I do still love my Ex. She has not done anything, yet, to merit me not loving her anymore.
And yes - I am still In love with my Ex. 
I assumed that being away from each other for an entire summer would summit the fact that I would be out of love with her. I assumed wrong.

Since October 1st, I have started journaling to better set traceable goals for myself and to better understand my emotions. It may seem like I am overanalyzing and I would not object if someone said I am, however I am just seeking to understand Those Feelz, to understand more in depth about what I am feeling.

I do understand this - I am very much In Love with her (and clearly love her too)

Now
Because this is ExNoContact forum, I understand the whole point of this forum is to not contact your ex and to get over them.
What I want to express through this post is some of the things I have learned


**Conclusion**
**Lessons Learned**

**Healing takes time. To hurt is ok. (If anything, it can be used as motivation for self-improvement)

**It is, eventually, possible to remain friends with your ex if you should still want them in your life. However, as I am learning now, one must fully emotionally heal before attempting this. I thought I had fully emotionally healed however clearly that is not the case.

**Understand that even if your Ex dumps you, in some cases, they hurt too. I too got into the negative mindset of saying that the person getting Dumped will hurt more however comparing pain is not productive nor healthy. 

**Some would say it is immature not to remain friends, however it is even more immature to willingly allow yourself emotional pain, willingly allow yourself no room to grow, and to willingly allow yourself to deprive yourself of the experience. 
**If you were dumped, or if you did the dumping, it is quite important to get back to who you were outside of the relationship. During my relationship, it got to the point where I was willing to give up my career, my dream, to spend just a few days in the same state as my then girlfriend. In retrospect, I was sure as hell not going to give up my dream for that, I just wanted a break and time to experience a normal relationship. However, the thought subconsciously behind that sentiment is an unhealthy one.
As a man, you should *NEVER* throw away your mission, your dream, for any girl, ever. Period full stop.
**Pick up a hobby, get a job, work out, work on your craft, invest in yourself, do stuff for you. Unless you plan on being single your entire life or, much worse, getting Married, there is probably not going to be a time in your life where you have so much free time dedicated solely to yourself. Even people who are out there running game on 3 girls or 3 guys every week have to make time for them. Each individual requires a certain level of investment.
The most important person to invest in is *yourself*

For example;
My main priorities right now are as follows

**Music**  (I went to school in Boston for music. Music is going to be my career. Am a Music Producer and Music Composer. Working on Mixing and Mastering skills. Now that I have time away from the bubble of musicians, I can think more clearly on how to have multiple streams of income from various aspects of music be it Producing and Composition (my main aspirations), teaching music privately, going back to school to get certified as a music teacher (Job Stability) whatever it may be, my Career Path is music. I have the skill set, the tools, and the talent enough to make this work. (Now I just need to work on Consistency)

**Magic**  (Picked up the hobby of magic over the summer. Not really good at it yet but if I keep practicing, not only will I get good at it, I may some day be good enough to not only teach it, but to make money from performances. Who knows. Neither are essential. Just picked it up because I like it. It is a hobby that is a *POTENTIAL* source of money. I personally think all hobbies should be a potential source of money, physically stimulating, emotionally stimulating or physically stimulating. 
One of my hobbies is video games... but there is no way I'll ever be good enough to play competitively. However, if you have guessed by Magic and Music, I love entertaining people as such, in the future, Streaming video games could be another possible income source. (After doing some research, this is not That unplausible and not that farfetched an idea.)

**Working Out** (Look, if you are going to get a girlfriend or a boyfriend in the future, you should be investing in yourself. Part of investing in yourself comes from being healthy and working out. Now, I'm not saying you need to be ripped but you should at least get to a point where you are happy and unashamed of your body. If I want my future girlfriend to be fit, I too need to be fit.)

**Getting Enough Sleep** (Notoriously did not sleep a lot in College. Can't say I have a healthy sleep schedule now, however I am getting the required 7 to 9 hours of sleep. *much better than in college*. Working Out also helps to make me TIRED enough at night to actually Go to sleep. 2 birds one stone)

**Getting a Job** (Because money is good)

**Getting an Internship** (Because experience is good)

**Comedy** (I've been told I'm positive and funny so part of doing things for myself have been to watch and study comedy. Study? Yes study. I am watching not only for enjoyment but to learn how to better present jokes and storytelling.

*******************************************

**Priorities** This is huge. I remember talking with my ex earlier this month and we both told each other, well I had already told her this in the past so it did come to bite me in the ass, that I am no longer a top priority  to her, nor is she to me. 
Why are priorities important? They'll not only give you something to focus on that ISN'T your Ex, they will give some structure to your life.

For Example;
This is how I organize my priorities on a day to day basis.
Group 1 are things I will not budge on and will find time to fit them into every day
Groups 2 and onward are things that I hope to get done but are not nearly as important as group 1

**Group 1**

(1a)Get A Job before going back to College in the Spring for extra much needed income

(1b)Create more music (product) for my own music production, teaching and outsourcing business. 
(1b.5)Write and keep track of my journal Every single day.

(1c)Get sleep somewhere in the day, at least 7 hours

(1d)Eat something every day. At least* two meals of some sort a day. (This is a biggy for me as the past year and a half in college, I'd live off of 1 meal, Maybe 2, per day. I have a habit of Just Not Eating) (I am broke so my choice of food is pretty absent. / Living at home, jobless, and broke until I get a job, top priority, and return to college) 

(1e)Cleanliness, attire, appearance*

(1f)Some form of exercise. Consistent form of exercise (Too broke to go to the gym. So at-home workouts and muscle building exercises it is)

**Group 2**

(2a)Hobbies that can translate into future income (Magic, Comedy) (I am good at being funny I have been told and Comedy is an artform all in itself)

(2b)Bills/finances (Re; get a job.) (So far in credit card debt that it is just comically bad at this point. Need a job to fix all of this)

(2c)Reading and gaining knowledge in general

(2d)Get better at socializing. Already good, but can always be better

**Group 3**

(3a)Spend time every day to meditate and create positive self talk

(3b)Learn how to date eventually. (Just got out of a 4 year, Long distance, relationship, thus I don't really know how to date.) *At such a low place on the priority list because nothing else in my life is in order so this cannot possibly be a priority right now.*

**Group 4**

(4a) Get a car. (I have concluded my motorcycle will be perpetually dead until next summer, nor do I have the money / will have the money, to get it fixed anytime soon)(If I'm going back to school in Boston, I do not NEED a car anytime REMOTELY soon.)

(4b) Travel (Money, can't afford this at the moment)

(4c) Attend seminars of any sort (Money. Can't afford this at the moment)


You will notice, with perhaps the exception of group 4, all of these are investing back into myself, bettering myself, working on self-improvement in some way. 3b, not so much; to some extent 3b is the Exact same as 2d.
This is my list. Each person's priorities will be vastly different.



Well, I don't know what else to say.

58xpi2,2,2016-10-23,Economic Analysis on Bubbles and St Louis Fed report,alwayzsuspicious,CIWO,https://www.reddit.com/r/CIWO/comments/58xpi2/economic_analysis_on_bubbles_and_st_louis_fed/,"&gt; Meanwhile, the housing bubble has only gotten worse over the past year.

You need to put things in context.

""rapid price gains in the biggest cities merely reflect underlying demand and a supply shortage, fundamentals that are very different to the kind of credit-fueled property boom-and-bust cycle seen elsewhere.

Big cities like Shanghai are experiencing net immigration with only limited blocks of land coming on the market.  “If Shanghai sells only one parcel of land in a year, the price of the land must be extremely high – this is not a bubble; this is a shortage of supply,” Hu said.""

http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-17/what-bubble-china-s-home-prices-driven-by-demand-investment-mismatch

&gt; A housing bubble is a run-up in housing prices fueled by demand, speculation and exuberance. Housing bubbles usually start with an increase in demand, in the face of limited supply which takes a relatively long period of time to replenish and increase. Speculators enter the market, further driving demand. At some point, demand decreases or stagnates at the same time supply increases, resulting in a sharp drop in prices — and the bubble bursts. http://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/housing_bubble.asp

&gt; That author is arguing against a straw man. Claims about a Chinese housing bubble are not necessarily claims that China's real estate environment is identical to that of the U.S. back in 2004-2007. Here is analysis from the St. Louis Fed that explores the potential implications of a Chinese housing bubble:

&gt; We therefore view our model as a useful starting point for studying the macroeconomic implications of the growing housing bubble in China. For example, a growing housing bubble reduces the private sector’s incentive to innovate. Because of the relatively low risk, low entry costs, and high profits in housing investment, the housing bubble has enticed many productive and high-tech firms in China to reallocate resources from research and development to the real estate market. In an economy in transition from a labor-intensive economy to a capital-intensive economy, such resource misallocation can be very costly: It may substantially prolong China’s economic transition and reduce China’s TFP growth, especially when its population is aging fast and labor costs are rapidly rising. We plan to empirically validate and quantify such resource misallocation within our framework in future works.

We are going meta and into the definition of what is a bubble there is four main bubble theories in finance and your own investopedia link is contradicting the Fed definition(Rational bubble). It's burdensome to just debate on that.

Furthermore there is two conclusions in your Fed paper

In the section E. Further Discussions of Model Implications

""Therefore, despite important cultural and institutional differences, these three emerging economies had development paths with features similar to China’s recent experience. Specifically, housing prices in all three economies grew faster than their GDPs despite high returns to capital during their respective economic transitions. Moreover, for both Korea and Taiwan, the completion of the transition process eventually leads to rising labor costs and the slowdown of housing price growth. These features are consistent with the predictions of our theory.""

Which the author of the link I gave you believe also

""China’s property market has become increasingly polarized over the past three years. Skyrocketing surges are mostly seen in major metropolises or regional hubs, while housing at the national level has actually become more affordable, in part due to rising incomes.""

­Now

&gt; Here is analysis from the St. Louis Fed that explores the potential implications of a Chinese housing bubble:

The analysis has nothing to back it's claims on potential implications or proof of resources misallocations. Which they admit themselves in the conclusion unlike the other sections there is no quote or datas it's all may and may , further research need to be done.

Just reading it was annoying for me because it has a normative bias , in this view, the paper does not focus on explaining actual economies, but instead on describing a theoretical world in which pareto optimality applies. The paper also rely too heavily on complex mathematical models, particularly those used in general equilibrium theory, without enough regard to whether these actually describe the real economy. 

Examples in the paper that hit me the most

1) for a similar result. In both that paper and ours, agency frictions drive a wedge between the social rate of returns to capital and the equilibrium rate of return.

2) This implies that the rate of returns to capital facing the marginal investor will dictate the rate of return to housing investment in a self-fulfilling housing bubble equilibrium by the no-arbitrage condition

3) This result stays the same because the equilibrium growth rate of housing prices in our model is determined by the rate of return to capital

4) POST-TRANSITION EQUILIBRIUM. — We now characterize the equilibrium in the posttransition stage.*

Also there is an error in the equation above page 16 section 11 and in page 21 , you can look it yourself and ask me further explanations if needed. It seems I cant add Algebra with Reddit formating , I will try to take a screenshot of my handwritting on my paper.

Also

­""We plan to empirically validate and quantify such resource misallocation within our framework in future works.""

They have been planning to do it since three years. It's just a ""working paper""

First in the 2014 version of this paper

Here the link https://research.stlouisfed.org/wp/2014/2014-022.pdf

And still in their 2016 revision of this paper they still are planning and have not found nothing

2016 "" Revised version"" https://research.stlouisfed.org/wp/2014/2014-022.pdf

The same conclusion as in 2014

""We plan to empirically validate and quantify such resource misallocation within our framework in future works.""

Yeah St Louis keep planning to find those datas.

­The author of of my link is perfectly right when he concluded the article by 

""If the Bermuda Triangle is a tomb for airplanes, China’s housing market is a tomb for economic forecasters,"" Hu said.

The St Louis Fed interns are deep in the Bermuda. Which they admitted in the last sentence of their conclusion.

Neo classical models in which firms and households are each homogeneous therefore after you collapse the analysis to that of a single “representative firm” and a “representative household,” and aggregate to form the firm and household sectors is not a good way to analyse post communist state like China or truly any countries.

Comparative Analysis/Comparative economics is the key to dismantling propped up positions about China. Some people (mostly westerners) need the topic in a vacuum otherwise their reliance on hype will fall apart. Information on Chinese economy is never context free- a single data point is meaningless. It is only when that data point is aggregated with others , when put into context of an argument ,That it acquires meaning."

It didn't matter. 

I just don't want to do anything. I want to drown in escapism because that's the only thing that gives me a little hope.

Despite putting some distance with the girl, she came back to me because she was bothered by how we were not talking anymore and how I was quite mean recently. Of course I fell again and now I can't get her out of my head. I just can't be  even friend with her anymore. It's bad for me. 

On top of that, I'm getting more and more lazier everyday, I have to find an internship in 2 months to get my degree and I haven't even started to search for companies, I'm screwed. I'm scared to do anything, those last 2 days have been hell,  usually it was just bad days, but now they are worse.

58xwqe,8,2016-10-23,City-State of Deuscunic,LJ_Lenz,createthisworld,https://www.reddit.com/r/createthisworld/comments/58xwqe/citystate_of_deuscunic/,"**Claim** : [Claim Circled in Orange](http://imgur.com/JmRyysF) Sorry it's so small.

**Name** : Deuscunic (Day-us-qeue-nick)

**Language** : English

**Government** : Guild-run Republic. Similar to Rome, Deuscunic uses two 'senators' from each guild rather than each region. Two Consuls are elected from this pool of senators each year to 'oversee' the forum and it's decisions.

**Political Organisation** : City State

**Population** : 2 Million

**Geography** 
Deuscunic is situated on a small island in the centre of Lake Unum. Lake Unum is the largest of the four that make up The Great Lakes. Lake Unum has a large electrical storm at it's centre. This proved dangerous for the Deuscunic until the Sciences Guild and the Engineers Guild figured out how to attract the lightning to a different location rather than their city. The surrounding lakes provide an abundant source of fish and the surrounding shoreline provides fertile soil for small-scale farming.

**Culture**
The Deuscunic, are the citizens of Deuscunic. They are humans and have no particular race or racial features. 

They are a dynamic people that concentrate on working hard to expand their city. They pride themselves on skills and achievements, this pushes them to be innovative. The workforce is split into different Guilds for each profession (eg. The Engineers Guild). Each Guild can be separated into a variety of Departments that cater for each job (eg. Engineers Guild can be split into Electrical Engineering Department etc..). 

The Deuscunic economy revolves around their currency called the Rand (Each Rand is comprised of 100 cents). The Rand is backed up by Rand Crystals (similarly to gold IRL). These crystals are formed at the bottom of Lake Unum where minerals are constantly subjected to electrified water and high pressures. Harvesting these crystals is very difficult and is a well kept secret by the Mining Guild in order to avoid theft. The 'bread and butter' of the internal economy is food, particularly crops. The small city-state is situated on an island and has limited fertile lands on the shored of Lake Unum with which to grow crops. This makes crops the most expensive food on the market, with the cheapest being fish harvested from the surrounding lakes with ease. Although there is a new farming method in development by the Agricultural Guild that could change this.

The Deuscunic (specifically the Sciences Guild) like to import strange creatures, plants or oddities from other countries in order to experiment with them. As for exports, Deuscunic will export their technology and knowledge if persuaded well enough. They are very wary of outsiders that they do not have ties with.

The Deuscunic love their ancient architecture. Despite being in the middle of an Industrial Revolution they have large pantheons and Roman-style houses lining the streets. The streets are made of cobblestones and they have large open squares and markets, along with the occasional statue or so. The Architects Guild has taken it upon themselves to keep this style going but to incorporate modern technology such as Chimneys, Iron/Steel and bricks.

The Deuscunic are a peaceful people and are neutral in any war or conflict that may take place. They have a limited army but have advanced technology such as gunpowder/fintlock rifles and cannons. With the right amount of persuasion they may be willing to sell this technology to other nations, but only with strict terms of use. They also own a small navy fleet that can patrol rivers in the case of an emergency. The fleet is situated in the harbour to the east of the island.

Citizens are known to have a bit of a superiority complex... (That may have something to do with the First calling Deuscunic the 'Perfect Society')

**The Guilds**
The workforce is split into Guilds. The Engineers Guild, The Sciences Guild, The Planning Guild, The Artisans Guild, The Economic Guild, The Religion Guild, The Defense Guild and the The White Collar Guild(WIP). Each Guild has a specific task in the running of the state.

Every Guild is split into different Departments for more specific jobs. Instead of going to schools for education, citizens choose which guild they'd like to join at the age of 15. For the rest of their lives they will learn on the job and become experts in their chosen fields. There are ranks in the guilds that span from Intern all the way to Guild Master, but promotion is difficult the higher you go. Guild Masters can only be replaced after their death, and some say that promotion is just a matter of timing and the luck of the draw.

**Technology**
WIP

**Government**
The Government is a Guild-run Republic. This means that each Department Head and Guild Master is allowed to attend Parliament. Discussions of parliament take place in the forums. Every member has a right to speak and a right to vote on discussed matters. Parliament meets once a week, unless there is an emergency.
There are two Consuls elected annually. It is these Consuls' job to lead the proceedings of the Parliament. Only Guild Masters are allowed to be candidates in the Consul voting.
Every month the Parliament holds a Public Forum in which any member of the general public is given a two minute slot to let their voice be heard and anyone is given the opportunity to sit in on these Public Discussions.

**History**
Deuscunic was founded by a group of men known as the First. They were members of different nations that met regularly to speak about Philosophy. One day they decided that their ideal society needed to become reality and sought out wealthy sponsors to fund their 'Perfect City' that would be a self-run state. After years of fund collections they had enough to establish their city, but they needed citizens. So the Guild system was born. The First went to surrounding nations and offered citizenship to all skilled workers that were willing to work in the Guilds. They started with a population of 10 thousand and now sit with a population of 5 million that we see today. The First died many years ago but are exonerated for their creation of the City-state by statues and murals found littered across the city.

There were actually a lot of people there and I was opening for my friend's band (it was their first ""show""). The CPU was maxing out (even though at home everything is usually perfectly fine) and it kept taking me so long to redo shit I ended up just saying fuck it and not playing.

It was so frustrating for so many reasons. One because my last show was great, so I expected a similar result (little to no technical difficulties). Two because there were so many people there (20-30 people is a lot to me as a local musician lol). Three because I could tell that if I had tried setting up early, I could have went around this problem easily. So I'm mostly frustrated with myself and feeling like I missed out on a good opportunity (not necessarily big but I was really excited). I feel pretty down. It's been a fucking chaotic month, what with school, internship, and two jobs where one of them has gotten pretty annoying managerial-wise. I didn't get a lot of time to practice save for the day before trying to play.

Anyway I realize it's not that big of a deal but because music is such a huge passion of mine, it was just pretty disappointing. After taking all my stuff down from inside the house, I went to sit in my car for a while. Although I didn't get to play my friend was very supportive. I want to try and figure out all the details into why my laptop sometimes does this. I want to avoid it at all costs so I don't miss out on opportunities. But yeah it does really suck lol trying not to think about it but I figured if I wrote it down maybe it would help a little bit"
58yps0,2,2016-10-23,Hillary and the Don,raceriots,The_Donald,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/58yps0/hillary_and_the_don/,"First thing you have to know about Donald Trump is that he is a time traveler from a time when men have enormous genitalia and towering intellects. That's just for starters. Ask about his mind control sometime. But the important part is that he can travel through time based on some arbitrary rules that will no doubt become important and retroactively seem logical enough.
 
Anyway, here is the story of Donald Trump's quest to save Hillary Clinton from her twin demons: Bill and Crooked. Some parts get a little twisty but don't worry, it's dank.
 
Hillary Rodham started life as a well adjusted young girl, bright and adorable. She was the smile on your grandpas face and the red in a schoolboys cheek. Life was an amazing adventure, full of laughter and fear and striving and loving and losing and wishing and hoping and yearning! This was a girl who knew no danger, knew no limit, knew no obstacle she could not overcome.
 
And she grew up to be a good little Goldwater girl. White America, red white and blue. A wonderful life awaited!
 
But she met Bill.
 
Bill was a cunt. The most charming guy you'll ever meet, but his biology gave him the ability to lie without feeling bad – an ability our bright eyed girl from the Midwest had no defense for. Bill looked at  her and said – lying, with sincerity! - that the rumors about him were all untrue and he was a good man and he'll be true and you'll never regret it...
 
Bill was a cunt. He lied well enough that our girl followed him lovingly and hopefully to meet her second demon.
 
Crooked came so easily onto our girl that it should scare all of us. Bill's lies couldn't hold up forever, Hillary was far, far too smart for that. But the idea Bill is a demon....? No. He is a good man.
 
The first lie. Crooked dug its talons deep with the first lie.
 
Uppity sluts claiming to the media that Bill had not been a good man were threatening his campaign for governor, and our Hillary stood in righteous defense of Bill, who was a good man. Crooked whispered that they were lying...the stories aren't true...Bill Is A Good Man.
 
With this, Hillary died. Crooked sank her talons in deep, and a bright eyed, happy child became Crooked Hillary. Such a monumental tragedy – an innocent lost to a demon she could not hope to outmatch! - reverberated through time and space and reached the ears of one Donald J. Trump, a humble wall merchant among the time-traveling large genitalia having future culture of blonde bawdy bosses. He heard her cry.
 
Across time and space...Don heard his girl cry for the first time. As Crooked pulled out her heart, his keen senses and boundless compassion created a bond unique in the universe between himself and the girl that could have been. The universe would never know what was lost. Don shook his head as tears rolled down his strong jaw. He would never have his girl.
 
But then he remembered he was a time traveler with a massive dong so he sent himself back in time to be born as a humble real estate developer's son in New York.
 
Now some may take this opportunity in the narrative to flesh out details, have several minor and major plots, make you really feel for the characters involved. Some may.
 
We all know the story up until now. How Bill and Crooked – the lying, so much lying, why won't it stop he makes me please why does he make me lie! - tore our little girl Hillary to pieces and left her corpse to be a puppet of the echoey interests.
 
All of this Don watched from afar, weeping every night because of what was being done to his true love. He would never feel truly at home with anyone but Hillary – his beautiful Hillary! - and Don's list of loves lost grew every year because of it. Empress Melania knew of his deep devotion to Hillary and loved him all the more for it because of the beauty and esoteric nature of such a transdimensional commitment. Melania loved the Don that would die for Hillary – and he was man enough for both of them, she well knew. She smiled, thinking about the three of  them together one day. He could love and provide for two women easily – for he was not a cuck.
 
On the Labor Day before the election, Don saw something that chilled him to the bone. His girl – our girl, Hillary! His girl was coughing on national television. She was coughing and hacking and having a stroke it seemed, but no, just a cough. Her voice returned, low energy at first, but it was there. That sweet, sweet voice he first heard years ago crying as it was silenced by Bill and Crooked.
 
It would soon be time to slay Crooked and begin saving his girl.
 
The first debate started like any other – standard introductions, claps, fake smiles, all the pageantry of an alleged democracy. When Don reached out to clasp Hillary's hand - his girl! no, Crooked still...- he felt the whisper of an echo of the memory of what some weaker men would call nervous for the first time in his impeccable life. Her hand felt as he hoped it would.
 
It felt better. It felt like home. He had a chance at his girl and he seized it.
 
&gt;Why are you so full of bullshit, Hillary?
 
i i i i ...
 
&gt;Hillary.
 
I am standing up for my pr...principles and fighting to make women equal to men and the poor wealthy and the unclever wise and night not to be so dark.
 
&gt;Hillary, you are a liar and a clown for the masses and the willing marionette of the masters whose flagrant strings you deny.
 
Stop that isn't true.
 
&gt;Hillary. You know it to be true. Search your feelings, my love.
 
No, I'll never love you, you're a monster!
 
&gt;Stop lying to yourself, you know who the real monster is.
 
As Crooked fell dead, vanquished and invisible, Hillary saw the truth for the first time in her life – Bill was a cunt.
 
Don comforted Hillary that night, not forgetting that the eyes of the nation – and the world, for that matter – (editor's note – and the transdimensional planes!) were fixed on Him and his new old love. He gazed into her burning eyes – burning with tears and regret and vengeance – and asked her one thing. Never lie again.
 
Crooked was dead. Long live Hillary, our Goldwater girl.
 
 
Hillary looked into her savior's eyes and knew in that moment all could be set right – all the evil of Crooked – if only her man and our man became the leader of the free world. We can do it together, she gasped to her lover. We can do it together.
 
Don mistook this endorsement for an invitation and kissed Hillary passionately on the neck. He felt as her skin formed shy girlish goosebumps of innocent love at every kiss and lick and caress. He gestured that the cameras be dismissed and the crowd dispersed so he could have his love.
 
And so his love could have him. And she did.
 
It mostly got in her hair but we'll call her a swallower anyway if it makes her feel good about herself. Women are weird.
 
Remember, earlier, how I said some parts will be twisty? Buckle up.
 
With Crooked dead our Hero set off to slay the monster of his girl's youth – the demon Bill. Don asked his love Hillary where the lecherous father of Crooked would be found and Hillary told him the only two things she knew to be true of ol' Slick Willy. He loved saxophone music and Vladimir Nabokov.
 
Donald Trump was crushed. How could he find the elusive Bill with such sparse intelligence? Don't be so stupid, Donald! His father's voice rang in his ears. There are many things that are sparse, but your intelligence, my son, will never be! Don remembered his father so well – nobody had believed in him so much. And he knew the words were true. Donald Trump is a brilliant man.
 
Don decided to narrow his search as much as possible using the data he had – saxophone music and  Vladimir Nabokov. After literally half an hour of unadulterated autism, Donald Trump discovered that a Jazz saxophonist had been booked to provide entertainment on a jet called the Lolita Express. Don smiled to himself, thinking where else would Bill be than listening to saxophone music on a private jet named in honor of his favorite author?
 
Wearing his customary suit and tie, all smiles, Dangerous Donald embarked on his greatest caper yet (ask about the time he saved Tokyo)! His private jet – TRUMP proudly emblazoned upon it like the banners of your countrymen – roared into the air chasing after Bill and the Lolita Express!
 
The Lolita Express was in a leisurely holding pattern over international waters. Lolitas don't like turbulence, Bill had said. The pilots had laughed dutifully then went back to not paying attention to anything but the front window. Watching for turbulence.
 
Trump Force One, using very high energy, caught up to the Lolita Express and became the only turbulence of the day. Don was arguing with the crewman who finally relented and let him keep his signature tie on as he was strapped into the escape rigging. If you can't look amazing doing something, don't do it.
 
The heroism hatch on the back of Trump Force One opened, and Dangerous Donald – our hero, Hillary's man! - jumped out and aimed for the top of the Lolita Express. He landed with a gentlemanly thud and nimbly attached himself to the aluminum hulk careening through the skies at a breathtaking clip. He had to work fast.
 
The drill made short work of the emergency hatch, and Dangerous Donald was inside. He was a predator. Keen senses, sharp mind, charm and composure – these were his allies. He heard a lick of music...saxophone? Saxophone. Bill could be near. He crept closer to the sound and quickly came to a door. Looking through...cheerleader? Why were there cheerleaders here? For all the world it looked like a Jr. High cheerleading practice, but the girls all looked a bit sadder than usual. Curious.
 
All that for another time though, because our Donald – Hillary's love, her hero! - heard Bill for the first time.
 
&gt;Come sit on my lap and ask o'l Bill what you want for Christmas, sugar.
 
Don was shocked! Bill was clearly doing the good work of the Clinton Foundation, volunteering his valuable time to make Christmas bright for these at risk preteens. Maybe Bill Is A Good Man.
 
No! No, Crooked, you will never again arise! Bill's trick had almost worked on Don, but Don's inherent machismo saved him from the slings and arrows of the villain. With a heavy heart, Don decided that even though Bill was being a perfect gentleman and noble with those young cute cheerleaders, he still must die.
 
Bill must die so Crooked can no longer haunt Hillary.
 
With the war bellow of a troop of gorilla alphas on bath salts, Dangerous Donald charged through the thicket of young girls and seized lecherous Bill by his most honorable member. Don was not impressed by either the length or the girth and frankly his hand has never stopped smelling faintly of intern and homework. Grasping the demon Bill by the loins, Trump radioed back to Trump Force One and was whisked clear of the Lolita Express. He spared a thought to the young girls now left unattended with a jazz musician, but such things are racist.
 
Donald Trump pulled evil Bill onto Trump Force One through the heroism hatch, which sealed behind them. Our Don relinquished his hold over the demon's wand and asked Bill if he had any regrets for what he turned beautiful Hillary into – the pawn of Crooked, a minster of Bill's making.
 
&gt;I did it for the pussy bro.
 
And Don wasn't even mad, because, lo, he did it for the pussy too. For he was not a cuck.
 
Bill was a cunt, though, so he must die. To save our girl.
 
Don looked at bill with love for his Hillary and asked if the devil had a last request.
 
&gt;Just lemme see it. I have to know.
 
Our hero, great Donald, a man of his word and beyond all reproach, did drop his trow and bestow the gift of the Visage of the Don upon Bill. The length, girth, and pure aesthetics of our hero's D are only described in hushed whispers of awe in modeling agencies the world over. It was too much for one man to bear the immense responsibility of viewing. All bill could say was
 
&gt;You're a big guy.
 
Don, taking up his pants and holstering his magnum, smiled wistfully. He straightened his tie, perfected the angle of his french cuffs, and fingered the grip of his smaller gun. He pulled it out, admired the custom wood grips hand chiseled by nuns in Abyssinia, and pointed it at the Monster.
 
&gt;For you.
 
Two bullets through its heart and the body falling from 30,000 feet, the demon Bill was slain.
 
Hillary – our girl! - was safe.
 
Touching down on Trump Force One, Don greeted Hillary with a passionate kiss. She melted into his embrace, feeling as one. Feeling like home. The most improbable, vivid, true, interdimensional and transtemporal love affair of all time had come true. Crooked was dead. Bill was dead. Long live Hillary, our Goldwater girl.
 
&gt;Don, I've taken care of everything. I've conceded the race to you, you're going to win the election!I know I'll never be the president I wanted to be, but i just wanted to make the world a better place all those years ago...before Bill. Before Crooked.
 
I know, love. I know. You are a good girl, I've known it forever. You hated the lies and the tricks and saw what the merchants were doing to our country...but you were their unwilling stooge, Hillary. I love you. It's all over now. And I was wondering something, Hillary.
 
&gt;Y-yes, my Don?
 
Would you like to be my vice president? Pence won't mind, he knows he is just there to shill to the evangelicals.
 
&gt;Really, Don? It would be a life's dream...and I know I do not deserve it!
 
You do, Hillary! You deserve the moon and the stars and the grandchildren to cover a continent! Please allow me to honor you as I may, since I may not as you deserve. I am, after all – he smiled – but a humble wall merchant.
 
Donald and Hillary walked the Capitol steps as the first married couple to take the office of President and Vice-President, respectively. Over six million attended the greatest inauguration the United States has ever witnessed. Ovens were busy for weeks before hand baking all of the wedding cakes needed for the big day – many couples wanted their wedding day to coincide with the auspicious occasion of the inauguration. The whole country was in a giddy mood as Don and Hillary took office. It was a painting and a movie and a song that fills your soul.
 
It was perfect.
 
And in that moment, among the six million, among the throngs and the pres and the officials and the Chief Justice, Hillary looked deep into the sapphire wisdom of her love's gaze.
 
&gt;Don
 
Yes, Hillary?
 
&gt;If I asked something of you, here, now, in this moment – would you do it?
 
For my love I would move time and space and slay demons. I would raise temples to your memory and slay your foes by the legion. I will do anything you ask, and be happier afterwards.
 
&gt;Donald...I...i just...i know it wasn't me, but all those deaths, all the lies...the emails...Crooked did so much evil...
 
I know, Hillary. But she is dead.
 
&gt;You slew her for me...I'll never for a second be able to forget how you braved the Lolita Express to slay my demon...I'll never forget, you have earned my love forever...but I must know that Crooked's work will be undone.
 
How can I grant you this wish?

And she grew up to be a good little Goldwater girl. White America, red white and blue. A wonderful life awaited!
 
But she met Bill.
 
Bill was a cunt. The most charming guy you'll ever meet, but his biology gave him the ability to lie without feeling bad – an ability our bright eyed girl from the Midwest had no defense for. Bill looked at  her and said – lying, with sincerity! - that the rumors about him were all untrue and he was a good man and he'll be true and you'll never regret it...
 
Bill was a cunt. He lied well enough that our girl followed him lovingly and hopefully to meet her second demon.
 
Crooked came so easily onto our girl that it should scare all of us. Bill's lies couldn't hold up forever, Hillary was far, far too smart for that. But the idea Bill is a demon....? No. He is a good man.
 
The first lie. Crooked dug its talons deep with the first lie.
 
Uppity sluts claiming to the media that Bill had not been a good man were threatening his campaign for governor, and our Hillary stood in righteous defense of Bill, who was a good man. Crooked whispered that they were lying...the stories aren't true...Bill Is A Good Man.
 
With this, Hillary died. Crooked sank her talons in deep, and a bright eyed, happy child became Crooked Hillary. Such a monumental tragedy – an innocent lost to a demon she could not hope to outmatch! - reverberated through time and space and reached the ears of one Donald J. Trump, a humble wall merchant among the time-traveling large genitalia having future culture of blonde bawdy bosses. He heard her cry.
 
Across time and space...Don heard his girl cry for the first time. As Crooked pulled out her heart, his keen senses and boundless compassion created a bond unique in the universe between himself and the girl that could have been. The universe would never know what was lost. Don shook his head as tears rolled down his strong jaw. He would never have his girl.
 
But then he remembered he was a time traveler with a massive dong so he sent himself back in time to be born as a humble real estate developer's son in New York.
 
Now some may take this opportunity in the narrative to flesh out details, have several minor and major plots, make you really feel for the characters involved. Some may.
 
We all know the story up until now. How Bill and Crooked – the lying, so much lying, why won't it stop he makes me please why does he make me lie! - tore our little girl Hillary to pieces and left her corpse to be a puppet of the echoey interests.
 
All of this Don watched from afar, weeping every night because of what was being done to his true love. He would never feel truly at home with anyone but Hillary – his beautiful Hillary! - and Don's list of loves lost grew every year because of it. Empress Melania knew of his deep devotion to Hillary and loved him all the more for it because of the beauty and esoteric nature of such a transdimensional commitment. Melania loved the Don that would die for Hillary – and he was man enough for both of them, she well knew. She smiled, thinking about the three of  them together one day. He could love and provide for two women easily – for he was not a cuck.
 
On the Labor Day before the election, Don saw something that chilled him to the bone. His girl – our girl, Hillary! His girl was coughing on national television. She was coughing and hacking and having a stroke it seemed, but no, just a cough. Her voice returned, low energy at first, but it was there. That sweet, sweet voice he first heard years ago crying as it was silenced by Bill and Crooked.
 
It would soon be time to slay Crooked and begin saving his girl.
 
The first debate started like any other – standard introductions, claps, fake smiles, all the pageantry of an alleged democracy. When Don reached out to clasp Hillary's hand - his girl! no, Crooked still...- he felt the whisper of an echo of the memory of what some weaker men would call nervous for the first time in his impeccable life. Her hand felt as he hoped it would.
 
It felt better. It felt like home. He had a chance at his girl and he seized it.
 
&gt;Why are you so full of bullshit, Hillary?
 
i i i i ...
 
&gt;Hillary.
 
I am standing up for my pr...principles and fighting to make women equal to men and the poor wealthy and the unclever wise and night not to be so dark.
 
&gt;Hillary, you are a liar and a clown for the masses and the willing marionette of the masters whose flagrant strings you deny.
 
Stop that isn't true.
 
&gt;Hillary. You know it to be true. Search your feelings, my love.
 
No, I'll never love you, you're a monster!
 
&gt;Stop lying to yourself, you know who the real monster is.
 
As Crooked fell dead, vanquished and invisible, Hillary saw the truth for the first time in her life – Bill was a cunt.
 
Don comforted Hillary that night, not forgetting that the eyes of the nation – and the world, for that matter – (editor's note – and the transdimensional planes!) were fixed on Him and his new old love. He gazed into her burning eyes – burning with tears and regret and vengeance – and asked her one thing. Never lie again.
 
Crooked was dead. Long live Hillary, our Goldwater girl.
 
 
Hillary looked into her savior's eyes and knew in that moment all could be set right – all the evil of Crooked – if only her man and our man became the leader of the free world. We can do it together, she gasped to her lover. We can do it together.
 
Don mistook this endorsement for an invitation and kissed Hillary passionately on the neck. He felt as her skin formed shy girlish goosebumps of innocent love at every kiss and lick and caress. He gestured that the cameras be dismissed and the crowd dispersed so he could have his love.
 
And so his love could have him. And she did.
 
It mostly got in her hair but we'll call her a swallower anyway if it makes her feel good about herself. Women are weird.
 
Remember, earlier, how I said some parts will be twisty? Buckle up.
 
With Crooked dead our Hero set off to slay the monster of his girl's youth – the demon Bill. Don asked his love Hillary where the lecherous father of Crooked would be found and Hillary told him the only two things she knew to be true of ol' Slick Willy. He loved saxophone music and Vladimir Nabokov.
 
Donald Trump was crushed. How could he find the elusive Bill with such sparse intelligence? Don't be so stupid, Donald! His father's voice rang in his ears. There are many things that are sparse, but your intelligence, my son, will never be! Don remembered his father so well – nobody had believed in him so much. And he knew the words were true. Donald Trump is a brilliant man.
 
Don decided to narrow his search as much as possible using the data he had – saxophone music and  Vladimir Nabokov. After literally half an hour of unadulterated autism, Donald Trump discovered that a Jazz saxophonist had been booked to provide entertainment on a jet called the Lolita Express. Don smiled to himself, thinking where else would Bill be than listening to saxophone music on a private jet named in honor of his favorite author?
 
Wearing his customary suit and tie, all smiles, Dangerous Donald embarked on his greatest caper yet (ask about the time he saved Tokyo)! His private jet – TRUMP proudly emblazoned upon it like the banners of your countrymen – roared into the air chasing after Bill and the Lolita Express!
 
The Lolita Express was in a leisurely holding pattern over international waters. Lolitas don't like turbulence, Bill had said. The pilots had laughed dutifully then went back to not paying attention to anything but the front window. Watching for turbulence.
 
Trump Force One, using very high energy, caught up to the Lolita Express and became the only turbulence of the day. Don was arguing with the crewman who finally relented and let him keep his signature tie on as he was strapped into the escape rigging. If you can't look amazing doing something, don't do it.
 
The heroism hatch on the back of Trump Force One opened, and Dangerous Donald – our hero, Hillary's man! - jumped out and aimed for the top of the Lolita Express. He landed with a gentlemanly thud and nimbly attached himself to the aluminum hulk careening through the skies at a breathtaking clip. He had to work fast.
 
The drill made short work of the emergency hatch, and Dangerous Donald was inside. He was a predator. Keen senses, sharp mind, charm and composure – these were his allies. He heard a lick of music...saxophone? Saxophone. Bill could be near. He crept closer to the sound and quickly came to a door. Looking through...cheerleader? Why were there cheerleaders here? For all the world it looked like a Jr. High cheerleading practice, but the girls all looked a bit sadder than usual. Curious.
 
All that for another time though, because our Donald – Hillary's love, her hero! - heard Bill for the first time.
 
&gt;Come sit on my lap and ask o'l Bill what you want for Christmas, sugar.
 
Don was shocked! Bill was clearly doing the good work of the Clinton Foundation, volunteering his valuable time to make Christmas bright for these at risk preteens. Maybe Bill Is A Good Man.
 
No! No, Crooked, you will never again arise! Bill's trick had almost worked on Don, but Don's inherent machismo saved him from the slings and arrows of the villain. With a heavy heart, Don decided that even though Bill was being a perfect gentleman and noble with those young cute cheerleaders, he still must die.
 
Bill must die so Crooked can no longer haunt Hillary.
 
With the war bellow of a troop of gorilla alphas on bath salts, Dangerous Donald charged through the thicket of young girls and seized lecherous Bill by his most honorable member. Don was not impressed by either the length or the girth and frankly his hand has never stopped smelling faintly of intern and homework. Grasping the demon Bill by the loins, Trump radioed back to Trump Force One and was whisked clear of the Lolita Express. He spared a thought to the young girls now left unattended with a jazz musician, but such things are racist.
 
Donald Trump pulled evil Bill onto Trump Force One through the heroism hatch, which sealed behind them. Our Don relinquished his hold over the demon's wand and asked Bill if he had any regrets for what he turned beautiful Hillary into – the pawn of Crooked, a minster of Bill's making.
 
&gt;I did it for the pussy bro.
 
And Don wasn't even mad, because, lo, he did it for the pussy too. For he was not a cuck.
 
Bill was a cunt, though, so he must die. To save our girl.
 
Don looked at bill with love for his Hillary and asked if the devil had a last request.
 
&gt;Just lemme see it. I have to know.
 
Our hero, great Donald, a man of his word and beyond all reproach, did drop his trow and bestow the gift of the Visage of the Don upon Bill. The length, girth, and pure aesthetics of our hero's D are only described in hushed whispers of awe in modeling agencies the world over. It was too much for one man to bear the immense responsibility of viewing. All bill could say was
 
&gt;You're a big guy.
 
Don, taking up his pants and holstering his magnum, smiled wistfully. He straightened his tie, perfected the angle of his french cuffs, and fingered the grip of his smaller gun. He pulled it out, admired the custom wood grips hand chiseled by nuns in Abyssinia, and pointed it at the Monster.
 
&gt;For you.
 
Two bullets through its heart and the body falling from 30,000 feet, the demon Bill was slain.
 
Hillary – our girl! - was safe.
 
Touching down on Trump Force One, Don greeted Hillary with a passionate kiss. She melted into his embrace, feeling as one. Feeling like home. The most improbable, vivid, true, interdimensional and transtemporal love affair of all time had come true. Crooked was dead. Bill was dead. Long live Hillary, our Goldwater girl.
 
&gt;Don, I've taken care of everything. I've conceded the race to you, you're going to win the election!I know I'll never be the president I wanted to be, but i just wanted to make the world a better place all those years ago...before Bill. Before Crooked.
 
I know, love. I know. You are a good girl, I've known it forever. You hated the lies and the tricks and saw what the merchants were doing to our country...but you were their unwilling stooge, Hillary. I love you. It's all over now. And I was wondering something, Hillary.
 
&gt;Y-yes, my Don?
 
Would you like to be my vice president? Pence won't mind, he knows he is just there to shill to the evangelicals.
 
&gt;Really, Don? It would be a life's dream...and I know I do not deserve it!
 
You do, Hillary! You deserve the moon and the stars and the grandchildren to cover a continent! Please allow me to honor you as I may, since I may not as you deserve. I am, after all – he smiled – but a humble wall merchant.
 
Donald and Hillary walked the Capitol steps as the first married couple to take the office of President and Vice-President, respectively. Over six million attended the greatest inauguration the United States has ever witnessed. Ovens were busy for weeks before hand baking all of the wedding cakes needed for the big day – many couples wanted their wedding day to coincide with the auspicious occasion of the inauguration. The whole country was in a giddy mood as Don and Hillary took office. It was a painting and a movie and a song that fills your soul.
 
It was perfect.
 
And in that moment, among the six million, among the throngs and the pres and the officials and the Chief Justice, Hillary looked deep into the sapphire wisdom of her love's gaze.
 
&gt;Don
 
Yes, Hillary?
 
&gt;If I asked something of you, here, now, in this moment – would you do it?
 
For my love I would move time and space and slay demons. I would raise temples to your memory and slay your foes by the legion. I will do anything you ask, and be happier afterwards.
 
&gt;Donald...I...i just...i know it wasn't me, but all those deaths, all the lies...the emails...Crooked did so much evil...
 
I know, Hillary. But she is dead.
 
&gt;You slew her for me...I'll never for a second be able to forget how you braved the Lolita Express to slay my demon...I'll never forget, you have earned my love forever...but I must know that Crooked's work will be undone.
 
How can I grant you this wish?

That's just for starters. Ask about his mind control sometime. But the important part is that he can travel through time based on some arbitrary rules that will no doubt become important and retroactively seem logical enough.
 
Anyway, here is the story of Donald Trump's quest to save Hillary Clinton from her twin demons: Bill and Crooked. Some parts get a little twisty but don't worry, it's dank.
 
Hillary Rodham started life as a well adjusted young girl, bright and adorable. She was the smile on your grandpas face and the red in a schoolboys cheek. Life was an amazing adventure, full of laughter and fear and striving and loving and losing and wishing and hoping and yearning! This was a girl who knew no danger, knew no limit, knew no obstacle she could not overcome.

Thanks in advence for help me, guys!
Have a nice day!"
58zgxr,8,2016-10-23,This has been the longest week of my life,Mysteroo,PrayerRequests,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrayerRequests/comments/58zgxr/this_has_been_the_longest_week_of_my_life/,"I volunteer at My church doing multiple things, so I start off my week driving forty minutes away to work all day at church. This is normal, except this week I'm left alone with somebody who has a crush on me because everyone who usually carpools with me was gone for one reason or another.

Long story short, this girl admits to liking me and I have to end up dodging my way around that without hurting the friendship in addition to being stuck driving back with her later that night alone.

This week happens to be the first week I decide to start consistently working out, meaning I'm painfully soar all throughout this week and I have to wake up deathly early.

I also am taking 18 credits of classes in college, which is the maximum even allowed.

So in addition to all this, monday I end up helping a friend record a wedding for four hours.

The next day I find out that the only girl I've ever had an interest in that I felt like I had a chance with has no interest in me. This is followed by me needing to work on another project for another four hours.

The next day, after classes and a midterm, I end up working another four hours for a class video project with an overbearing friend who decided to come hang out qt the same time.

The next day I work another four hours doing the same thing, followed by making up an hour of work that I missed at my internship, which is something else happening throughout this week.

Then the next day I puked during my workout before working another hour recording for this three minute video in the midst of all the other physical and emotional exhaustion.

Saturday I end up working FIFTEEN hours straight on another video project for school.

Finally today I'm starting another week early in the morning working all day at my church, only to find out that I've been volunteered to play a part in the Christmas play in which I am a character married to the very girl who admitted to liking me the week before.

I feel dead tired and I still have an enormous amount of work to do this week in addition to four friends all telling me we need to hang out in the next nine days. Pray I survive guys"

&amp;nbsp;

I'm looking for a full time employment but I'm open to internships and temporary.

&amp;nbsp;

A bit about myself:

&amp;nbsp;

I hold a Network+ certification and troubleshoot a lot of my friends, family and my own hardware. I'm saving money to be able to have the time to study for and pay for the Sec+ exam.

&amp;nbsp;

My customer service is on point. I am very proud that I'm one of the few nerds that can talk to people about anything. The 5 star comments I have back this up. I even teach when given the opportunity.

&amp;nbsp;

I've tutored different levels of Math and Physics throughout high school and college and started tutoring Java in college. Currently on call for Grade Potential for those subjects.

&amp;nbsp;

I have competed in Google's CodeJam this year - placed in the 7000s out of 33,000 contestants open to everyone except Google employees, so entries range from Facebook to grad students and more. Looking forward to competing in Facebook's competition as it has no restrictions.

&amp;nbsp;

Another competition I did was in college - I didn't place but I had the highest marks for documentation and over all code design. This was a GUI battleship game.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

I am not in a stable enough situation to continue my education to earn my degree. I also feel I would learn a lot more from working in the field than in a classroom structure as a lot of what I have learned in the classroom I have learned is not correct or isn't practiced in the field when it comes to programming. Example: binary searches in most texts don't check to see if the array index wrapped around and could cause a security vulnerability or a function returns a local variable.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

I have no preference to the location I work - I've recently applied to a position with the post office in MN. Looking forward to any and all leads.

&amp;nbsp;

Thank you."
58zjnw,2,2016-10-23,M4F Sunday Funday with Roulette,BreakFromReality,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/58zjnw/m4f_sunday_funday_with_roulette/,"Hi there, and welcome to DPP Casino! I'm your host, BreakFromReality, and I'll be accompanying you in your journey to find a fun, erotic roleplay.

Please check your ID with the security guard -- all potential RP partners and their characters MUST be at least 18.

So now that you're here, how do you get started?

First, you'll sit down at our [single-deck blackjack table](https://www.random.org/playing-cards/), where you'll be deciding the kinks of the RP. You'll be dealt eight starting hands of blackjack, with each total matching up with a specific kink. (For example, a 20 is for cheating.)

Here's the full list of kinks:

* 4 -- Dealer's Choice
* 5 -- Light Bondage
* 6 -- Group Sex (MFMF, MFMFMF)
* 7 -- MFM Threesome
* 8 -- FFM Threesome
* 9 -- Interracial/Raceplay
* 10 -- Anal (Woman Receiving)
* 11 -- Filmed
* 12 -- Clothed Sex
* 13 -- Dirty Talk/Name-Calling
* 14 -- Rough Sex (Hair-Pulling, Spanking, Light Choking, etc.)
* 15 -- Public Sex
* 16 -- Creampie/Risk of Impregnation
* 17 -- Facial
* 18 -- Risk of Getting Caught (i.e. ""hold the moan"")
* 19 -- Uniform/Costume
* 20 -- Cheating
* 21 -- Player's Choice

Once eight unique hands are drawn, you will choose two kinks that you would like to include in the RP. You will also eliminate two other kinks that you would not like to include. The dealer will then choose two kinks of the remaining four.

The Dealer's Choice and Player's Choice can not be excluded.

*(To play: draw 2 cards from 1 shuffled deck. Make sure all cards except jokers are included. Repeat this eight times until complete.)*

Once the kinks are decided, you'll decide if you want to stay on the main casino floor or head over to The Den. *(While I will absolutely play with everyone, those choosing to go to The Den will get VIP status.)*

If you choose the main floor, you will head to our [roulette wheel](https://www.random.org/sequences/), where you'll help decide the character you'll be playing. The women listed on the wheel will be character models only (with one exception).

The list is as follows:

* 0 -- Player's Choice of Anyone on the List
* 1 -- You, because you're always #1 at DPP Casino!
* 2 -- Bella Thorne
* 3 -- Dove Cameron
* 4 -- Laurel Coppock
* 5 -- Alison Brie
* 6 -- Kendall Jenner
* 7 -- Candice Patton
* 8 -- Margot Robbie
* 9 -- Vanessa Hudgens
* 10 -- Scarlett Johansson
* 11 -- Taylor Swift
* 12 -- Miley Cyrus
* 13 -- Ariana Grande
* 14 -- Emma Stone
* 15 -- Milana Vayntrub
* 16 -- Nina Dobrev
* 17 -- Rihanna
* 18 -- Sarah Hyland
* 19 -- Lily Aldridge
* 20 -- Mila Kunis
* 21 -- Stella Maxwell
* 22 -- Dianna Agron
* 23 -- Chloe Grace Moretz
* 24 -- Katherine McNamara
* 25 -- Victoria Justice
* 26 -- Carrie Underwood
* 27 -- Jennifer Lawrence
* 28 -- Selena Gomez
* 29 -- Emilia Clarke
* 30 -- Emily Ratajkowski
* 31 -- Meghan Markle
* 32 -- Jourdan Dunn
* 33 -- Katy Perry
* 34 -- Aubrey Plaza
* 35 -- Nicole Beharie
* 36 -- Ariel Winter

You will spin the wheel six times (12 for two-female scenes and 18 for three-female scenes). You will then pick three characters (six for two-female scenes and nine for three-female scenes). The dealer will then choose the character he would like you to play (the Player's Choice may get excluded).

*(To play: Set the smallest value at 0 and the largest value at 36, and keep it in one column. Take the first 6/12/18 numbers in the list.)*

Finally, it's time to ""role"" the dice at the [craps table](https://www.random.org/dice/) and see just what you'll be playing. The roles are below:

* 2 -- Dealer's Choice
* 3 -- Coach's Daughter
* 4 -- Friend's Wife/Girlfriend
* 5 -- Student
* 6 -- Sister's/Daughter's Friend
* 7 -- Incest (Daughter, Sister, Cousin)
* 8 -- Friend's Sister/Daughter
* 9 -- Work Scenario (Secretary, Intern, Co-Worker, etc.)
* 10 -- Wife's/Girlfriend's Friend
* 11 -- Bully's/Bullying Victim's Sister
* 12 -- Player's Choice

*(If Celebrity is chosen, you will be playing the actual celebrity from the wheel instead of a lookalike. For 12, I am giving the option of playing either the bullying victim's sister or an interesting revenge plot with the bully's sister.)*

You will roll the dice four times. Of the four unique roles, you will then discard one. The dealer will discard one of the remaining three, and you will then choose one (or both, if possible) of the remaining two.

*(To play: simply roll two virtual dice. Repeat until four different roles are picked.)*

After that is done, we will have the RP with the characters, roles and kinks!

Now if you choose The Den?

Here's the list of characters for the roulette wheel:

* 0 -- Player's Choice of Anyone on the List
* 1 -- You, as a woman age 40+ (if you're not one already)
* 2 -- Rena Sofer
* 3 -- Nigella Lawson
* 4 -- Christie Brinkley
* 5 -- Eva Longoria
* 6 -- Rashida Jones
* 7 -- Jane Seymour
* 8 -- Elizabeth Hurley
* 9 -- Jennifer Lopez
* 10 -- Julianna Margulies
* 11 -- Patricia Heaton
* 12 -- Cheryl Hines
* 13 -- Jordan Ladd
* 14 -- Jennifer Aniston
* 15 -- Giada de Laurentiis
* 16 -- Julie Bowen
* 17 -- Alyson Hannigan
* 18 -- Gabrielle Union
* 19 -- Melinda Clarke
* 20 -- Jennifer Garner
* 21 -- Marcia Cross

* 30 -- Julianne Moore
* 31 -- Kim Cattrall
* 32 -- Ellen Barkin
* 33 -- Sharon Stone
* 34 -- Paula Patton
* 35 -- Mary Steenburgen
* 36 -- Courteney Cox

And here are the roles:

* 2 -- Dealer's Choice
* 3 -- Coach's Wife
* 4 -- Friend's Wife
* 5 -- Teacher/Principal
* 6 -- Mom's Friend
* 7 -- Incest (Mom, Aunt, Grandmother)
* 8 -- Friend's Mom
* 9 -- Work Scenario (Boss, Co-Worker, etc.)
* 10 -- Wife's Friend
* 11 -- Bully's/Bullying Victim's Mom
* 12 -- Player's Choice

That does it for our tour! We can't wait to play with you, and we know you'll have a good time; others have! 

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. And from all of us at DPP Casino, have a winning day!"
58zvdr,1,2016-10-23,"M4F-Lotta kinks and prompts in there. (insertions/toys, nonhuman, vanilla, its all there.)",[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/58zvdr/m4flotta_kinks_and_prompts_in_there/,"Hello DPP, somehow I keep coming back here, haha. Anyways, you can probably guess that I enjoy some more out there kinks, so I won't be be offended if this isn't for you. I have multiple prompts that  span all kinds of kinks and settings Personally, I have a more narrative RPing style, kind of like being a GM or a CYOA. So if that appeals to you, please reply! In general I reply about a paragraph or two, and would appreciate a partner that does the same. My usual style is something a little more light and fun oriented, but if prompted right I will do a more serious/dark prompt as well. I am usually not at my computer for long, but I will make a genuine effort to reply and get back to you! Any ways, have fun everyone, and happy DPPing. (Also, here are some kinks in no particular order or favoritism)

Main Kinks: large insertions, toys/machines, sexy outfits/heels, beast/alien, tentacle, CYOA, overt plots, probably more.

Limits: Gore/violence, true vore, incest, bathroom shenanigans, futa, snuff/death/necro, ageplay, probably more.

PROMPTS:

Just as a disclaimer, feel free to tinker with these however you want, throwing your personal spin on them. Maybe you take a premise of one and plug it into a different setting, add in/remove kinks, have fun. ;)

The Land of Eroticia: Legends told of a seed that would fall from the heavens, opening a new age into the living world. It fell in a large, but struggling kingdom falling into economic ruin, but that changed with the emergence of the heaven said. This seed grew into a massive tree at the center of the kingdom, reaching far enough into the sky that its peak was obscured. For decades the tree grew, yielding many questions as to its nature. Eventually, several gates appeared at its base, and people could enter this strange new world. What awaited them was not what they expected. A land far larger than the outer tree, it was filled life, and magic alien to the mortal world around it. But something else was different about this world. People found their bodies changing, men and woman reaching extremes of their forms, and discovering new found sexual desires. Even the creatures possessed magical abilities and only exemplified this quality. Now, there are several settlements throughout it, some with the intension to gain territory, but many for trade to ship rare and magical good to the outside world. So what is your role in this world? Looking to make a name for yourself as an adventure? Business aficionado? Or another reason?

Botanist: Deep in the amazon there is a flower known for its unique lore and properties. Considered the flower of sexuality to local indigenous populations, supposedly it increased the sexual drive and ability of every one whom came in contact with it. This flower has since been found by scientists, and is currently being tested to develop the new age of sexual aides. You will play either a scientist or even a new intern at the facility it is being examined at. Maybe a little after hours work yields interesting results and you volunteer to work late for science on a continual basis, becoming addicting to scent and sexual perversions of the plant.

Primal Planet: Far in the universe aliens explore foreign worlds, and undergo their own scientific research on new worlds and to progress their scientific knowledge. One group often abducts humans, sending them to new planets to explore the surface. This is to make sure it is safe for their researchers, but also to test how the lifeforms and environment interact with outside beings. In this prompt you will be abducted, and sent to primal world filled with alien creatures that could have all forms of unique interactions with you. I often include a few things in this prompt, an aphrodisiac atmosphere, and mild transformation. This is usually just making you able to breath the new atmosphere, be more physical tough and able to handle more (you can imagine what you might need to handle more of…)

Sci-fi Porn shoot: Set in a science fiction, aliens and interplanetary travel kind of universe (same as the ambassador prompt) the idea is that you would go into a porn shoot which focuses on a human female and one or various alien creatures. This idea can have a lot of variance, the typical aesthetic of not knowing it was a porn audition, maybe you did and didn’t realize it would be inter species, or maybe you are all for it and intentionally went to it, it is up to you.

The Temple of the Phalisians: Deep in the jungles of the Amazon lies the temple of the phalisian's. An ancient culture known for it's people that pushed the extremes of their genders, muscular, well endowed men and woman with pronounce hourglass figures. You will play an archaeologist, making your way through the temples many kinky traps and turns to discover their artifacts and culture.

Intergalactic Senate: A more long term oriented RP, you will play the role of an ambassador of earth amidst an intergalactic senate. The RP will likely take place on a massive space station. This prompt does have some plot focus, but the sexual elements are there. The idea is that you must use you political knowledge and powers of persuasion to accomplish whatever goals you have. There are heavy behind the scenes, blackmail, all of the usual political fun, but in space, and with aliens.

School of Magic: The Foria School of magic, know as a premier school for teens and 20s to expand their magical potential! Only the finest of magic users leave the school with seals of education, choosing from subjects like summoning, horticulture, elemental manipulation, and more! This prompt can go a lot of ways, are you a teacher, a student? Maybe some new plant grabs your attention, or you test some magic on a group of well hung statues. Discover a lost summoning tomb? If you have a kink and want to do something a little more outlandish, this is a good prompt for you.

Its just business: You would play as a high echalon business woman, attending some form of investors conference. Individuals from all industries come to this, showing their producs in elaborate displays, and later meet in private to discuss business terms. The premise is that these investors would see you, and agree to invest in your company, but with the catch of a few favors. Maybe you meet for some slightly rough intercourse, maybe you are bribed to let an animal mount you in front of a group of individuals, or perform as a bikini model in a car show, things like that.

To be summarized: Super hero (wardrobe malfunctions, public sex with the monsters, etc). Alien abduction, you are examined and probed in various manners. Or, maybe they put in some tank with another creature just to see how the two species interact. Space Explorer, taking on strange planets, asteroids, you name it! Also I might be open to some r34 (Marge Simpson, Peach, more?) More to come!

5900us,7,2016-10-23,I [19F] feel like my boyfriend [20M] is letting go of his ambitions for me and feel guilty,ambitiousGirlfriend,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5900us/i_19f_feel_like_my_boyfriend_20m_is_letting_go_of/,"We have been seeing each other for over a year long-distance (a few hours drive, visits ~1/2x monthly and summer together). He is in a lucrative degree at a great college and since we met, he's been clear about wanting to go abroad and work for very prestigious companies within his field. He has a 1 year internship coming up. 

I raised my eyebrow at what that would mean for us because he initially was treating it as though we would have to break up when he left to go work abroad. He is immensely talented and I do believe he could get a job abroad with one of the major companies if he really tried, or at the very least a job abroad with someone. I let him know that if he saw that as the end point for our relationship, I wasn't interested in continuing to see him but we worked it out. He said that he didn't realize the way he talked made it seem like that and provided things were going well, he thought we could continue long-distance. I agreed and we moved past it.

Now he is applying for jobs. Although he has applied to most of the large companies he wanted to apply to and hasn't heard back good news, he has received interviews from multiple other companies abroad. But he also applied to MANY local positions. I asked him which firm he would choose if he got offers from everyone who interviewed him and he said that he was really leaning towards a local company, despite having had interviews with (admittedly smaller and less well known but still credible) companies abroad. He also told his other friends before me about his other international interviews and won't tell me that a position he's interviewing for is abroad unless I ask.  

I feel very guilty because I'm trying to support him and I'm also currently applying to graduate school (yes, I'm a bit young, the ages are right) not in our area. It seems weird to me that he has become so willing to settle for a company in our area so soon--the application process continues in the first round until late December to January so he still could get an offer from someone abroad, and the international companies that interviewed him, although not giants in his field, are perfectly good and in line with his goals too. The salary is likely lower in our area AND the work is comparable.

I'm struggling with feelings of guilt and that he may be pushing himself to be content with staying here for me. I tell him that I would support him going abroad and I want him to do what's best for his career and he just shrugs it off. I feel extra guilty that at the same time as he's doing this, I'm applying to school hoping to go further away. I'm obviously not about to change my top school but at the same time, I feel hypocritical. Any advice for similar situations?
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: boyfriend was excited about big jobs internationally and suddenly changed his tune and i feel guilty/want to make sure he's not doing it because of me"

590bfd,2,2016-10-23,M4F - Something Rough and Fun - Pick a Character!,MyDirtyDirtyDPP,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/590bfd/m4f_something_rough_and_fun_pick_a_character/,"OK DPP, it's confession time: I work in law, and while that sounds exciting to people when they first hear it, law is pretty boring. I don't work in an exciting field, I don't get exciting cases; I live pretty well but it's not exactly fun. In fact it's pretty damn stuffy. The rest of my life's pretty much the same way - I work, I jog, I meet clients, and sometimes I have vanilla sex.

Maybe that's why in my downtime I'm spending more and more time thinking about how much I'd love to just *wreck* some of the women in my life. Facefuck them, cockslap them, gag them, call them names, pound the shit out of them... You get the drill, and I'd love for someone to play one of them for my pleasure.

I've selected my five favourites for you to choose from and listed a little about them below. Pics are available of all of them if you need a little inspiration before you choose:

**Kirsty**
The bitchy, bleach-blonde daughter of one of the senior partners. Her family sent her to the best schools, the best colleges, nothing but the best, but she revels in being a bitchy blonde bimbo who knows she'll never have to work a day in her life. She's also a total attention whore who knows her cute looks and important name get her places, and that drives everyone at the firm who isn't getting ahead on name alone absolutely crazy, and even annoys some of her own family!

Scene idea: Her dad cuts off her credit card and the job he got her at an upscale clothing store just doesn't cut it for a girl like her. She decides to make him mad by coming on to one of his employees, but gets way more than she expected - she thought he'd just get told that she was flirting with his employees, but she ends up getting a nasty perverted fucking that she loves every second of!

**Jess**
Kirsty's rock chick younger sister. 18 and full of attitude, she takes no shit and isn't afraid to backtalk anyone. Jess hates Alex's guts and would do anything to get one over on her, and hates that her dad makes her spend so much time at the office stuffing envelopes while her sister gets to spend all the family's money and do absolutely nothing. Doesn't he know that hanging around all these stuffed shirts takes time away from her band?

Scene idea: She's sick of her goody-goody little sister getting all the praise. She's had to work twice as hard for half the attention, and the only way she's going to make up the difference is with shock and awe: Getting one of her dad's employees to fuck the shit out of her in the most obscene ways, and call up her stupid family and tell them what she's doing while she's doing it!

**Lucy**
The studious and preppy intern. A late night at the office is her idea of a good time and anything other than constant study is a wild weekend for her. Though she doesn't really know it - or at least doesn't pay attention to it - she's actually a little pocket rocket; short and cute with dark blonde hair, her boobs are *huge* and no matter how she dresses she can't help but show them off - either that or they're just too big to hide!

Scene idea: Part of her internship here means we get her to take exams. She's so desperate to pass her end of year assessment that, despite all her study, she breaks into the records room when she thinks nobody else is in the building to look at the results previous interns got so she can copy the answers. When I catch her, there's no limit of what she'll do to get me to not ruin her future career.

**Kayla**
Personal trainer for a few people at the firm. She's a pretty, confident blonde with flexibility and stamina to burn. Being 5' 2"" hasn't stopped her being super feisty, and the hours she spends in the gym makes her think that she's a match for anyone, man or woman, who tries to take her on. All those hours spent around toned men take their toll, though, and finishing work super-horny with nobody to take it out on is a common occurrence.

Scene idea: I decide to widen my workout routine and drop by to see her at the 24 hour gym after a late night at work. She knows that the best way to tone up is with some MMA training, so she decides to show me a few holds. Things get a little competitive, one thing leads to another, and she ends up getting used as a personal workout tool!

**Kim**
An ambitious and attractive associate who's more than willing to use her looks to get ahead - to the point of getting herself some big fake tits to either better impress the bosses or better influence judges. She is a stone cold bitch and there's nothing she won't do to climb the latter, no matter who she has to step on to get there.

Scene idea: Its only me and her working late at the office and she wants to get away to go and schmooze at a party for the partners that's happening down the street. She tries to dump her work off on me, first by basically demanding I do it when she doesn't have the authority and then trying to use her looks to convince me. Unfortunately for her she only convinces me to do something else.

All ideas are optional and negotiable, and we can either adjust my scenarios or come up with our own. My main interests are listed above, but today I'm into anything rough and nasty you can think of! (with the usual exceptions of pee, poop and death) 

This is a standing prompt, so feel free to message me any time you find it, and I'm happy for one-offs or for us to work through more than one character. If this prompt is old when you read it, I might even have new characters for you to play - feel free to ask!

Hopefully this isn't too long and you're still reading; if any of my ideas turn you on or you want to know more, drop me an orange envelope.

Happy writing!"

5919pd,10,2016-10-23,The Strange Occurrence At Crowley Manor [Part 4],ZaphodBeeblebrox74,libraryofshadows,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/5919pd/the_strange_occurrence_at_crowley_manor_part_4/,"[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/58h7st/the_strange_occurrence_at_crowley_manor_part_3/)

I opened my eyes and found myself clad only in boxer shorts, in the bedroom of my Arkham apartment. Having no recollection of how I'd arrived there was disconcerting, but the sounds of running water and clinking of dishware, were even more so; someone was in my kitchen, and had apparently made themselves quite at home.
 
 
 Making my way out of bed, I noted that my body had seemingly completely recovered from my time at Crowley Manor, though my head was aching from an internal pressure of some kind. The clinking noises continued, accompanied with the sound of opening cabinets; it appeared that this person was washing my dishes. As stealthily as I could manage, I put on a piar of trousers, making certain that the noises in the kitchen continued, and I wasn't heard; I nearly fell over due to poor equilibrium, which was most likely a result of the growing pressure inside my head. With furtive steps, I'd made my way into the hall outside the bedroom, and had pressed myself against the wall, listening intently; the washing had stopped. Footsteps of a kind I would ascribe to the heeled variety of womens footwear told me that though I may likely be physically superior to this stranger, she wouldn't be here unless she was certain that she could protect herself, so I determined to refrain from springing out at her; instead, I waited. A shapely blonde woman of middling height, wearing a black dress with rose print, cinched in the middle with a patent leather belt, passed through the hall and into the living room. 
 
 Quickly, I moved in and pinned her to the wall. ""Who are you, and why are you in my apartment?"" I demanded, as I glared into her startled, electric blue eyes.
 
 ""Get your hands off of me!"" she snapped, reversing my hold on her and landing a solid blow to my mid-section, knocking me over an ottoman and onto the floor; clearly, I'd underestimated her.

 As I lay on the floor, trying to regain my balance and pride, realization replaced the fear she'd previously expressed, ""What are you doing awake? You should be in bed!"" she said, as she stooped to assist me; as she did so, I couldn't help but note her resemblance to a young Veronica Lake.
 
 ""Who are you?"" I asked, refusing her help to stand.
 
 ""I'm an intern at the Institute,"" she replied matter-of-factly. ""My name is Eunice Adams, and Mr. Darby tasked me with seeing to your recovery. He's going to be pissed when he hears about this.""
 
 ""My apologies for assaulting you, Miss Adams,"" I replied, wincing at the bruise already forming on my sternum. ""I must admit that I'm not accustomed to having a stranger in my home, especially when I'm not even aware of how I came to be here in the first place.""
 
 ""Don't worry about that, just get back into bed,"" she said, grabbing me firmly by the arm with an exceptional strength. ""You're not ready to be up and about yet.""
 
 Weakness caught up to me as she half-carried me back to my room. ""Clearly. I've never been bested by a woman before, and certainly not by one that looks like you.""
 
 ""Thank you for the backhanded compliment,"" she replied, as I dropped limply back onto my bed. ""It's called Jiu-Jitsu, and Darby or not, you'll learn more of it the hard way if you don't put that Old World male chauvinism into check.""
 
 While I'd never considered myself a chauvinist before, I had to concede that her point was valid. ""Forgive me. The last thing I want to do right now, is upset the very formidable and very beautiful Miss Eunice Adams,"" I muttered, as I closed my eyes to the growing pressure in my head.
 
 ""Save the charm for another time,"" she answered, as she stood at my bedside. ""You need your rest.""
 
 
 In the darkness of unconsciousness, chanting voices and the terrible sounds of unknown creatures haunted me. I was lost in a black cloud of tentacles and gnashing teeth that sought me out no matter where I ran; it was as though my nightmare were real and if I were to be caught, my soul would be rent asunder and I would cease to exist. I often woke, soaked in sweat and hearing the soothing voice of Miss Adams by my side, telling me that I was safe; my delirium was such that I would often be swinging my arms in an attempt to ward off my imaginary attackers which, if my hazy memory of the period serves, resulted in my striking Eunice on more than one occasion, though she never confirmed this memory when I was finally lucid.
 
 
 Eventually, my fever subsided and I was again a part of the waking world, though the shadows of my trauma were never very far from mind; every dark corner or ill-lit hallway, threatened to come to life and drag me into the abyssal fog that had previously held me captive. Miss Adams had been by my side the entire time, caring for me and seeing to my every need. It was quite an alien feeling for me, to have a caretaker with such a sense of loyalty and concern.
 
 
 Malcolm visited as often as he could manage, but the goings-on at Crowley Manor had kept him away for long periods, during which he would leave messages thanking Miss Adams for her diligence and admonishing her to keep me at home to convalesce, as the frightful situation was now well in-hand. 
 
 
 To pass the time, Eunice and I would have long conversations about our lives and some of the stranger business that we've witnessed during each of our associations with the Institute. Eunice shared the story of her upbringing and the loss of her parents to the agents of some nefarious cult that they'd been investigating on behalf of the Institute, which was when Malcolm took her in and saw to her education, while using resources from the University to grant her protection from further harm. We'd lived together in this way for nearly three months when, as the story often goes, we fell in love. She'd come to check on me one evening as I readied myself for bed, and quite innocently kissed my forehead before turning to leave the room. If I could have kept myself from snatching her hand and pulling her to me, I don't know how. We made love that night, and every night after; needless to say, she no longer felt the need to sleep in the guest bedroom.
 
 
 Though I'd certainly had my share of romantic associations in the past, Eunice was different; being in her early 20's, her experience in life paled in comparison to my own, yet I'd never found someone so compatible with me in every way. Our relationship had moved from caregiver and patient, to lovers in the most intense sense imaginable; the demons were losing their place in my psyche, and she more than filled that void in my mind, and heart. We determined together that on Malcolm's next call, we must share with him that our situation had changed in a most drastic and wonderful way.
 
 
 Several more weeks passed and finally, Malcolm came by to check on my well-being. The shock of seeing that Eunice and I were living as a couple was evident in his expression, though he surprisingly did not say a word about it until Eunice had gone to the grocery store to purchase the makings of our dinner.
 
 ""Edward, I'd be lying if I claimed to have never heard of the healing powers of love, but have you and Eunice taken everything into consideration before embarking on this journey together?"" he asked, looking concerned.
 
 ""What are you referring to, Malcolm?""  
 
 ""Quite frankly, does she know all of your history?"" he raised an eyebrow. ""All of it?""
 
 ""She knows enough, Malcolm. What are you really getting at? Is this about our work at the Institute?"" I asked, somewhat defensive. ""Do you think that we'll allow our relationship to interfere with our work?""
 
 ""You know damned well what I'm getting at, Edward,"" Malcolm snapped, uncharacteristically. ""Have you told her everything?""
 
 ""Malcolm, I-"" I couldn't understand why he would press me so strongly to tell Eunice something that he knew was extremely sensitive and dangerous.
 
 ""I didn't think so,"" he interrupted. ""If you're going to become romantically involved, the girl must must be taken completely into your confidence, Edward.""
 
 ""You're right, of course,"" I admitted. ""I suppose I was waiting for the proper time to explain it all to her.""
 
 ""The proper time?"" he blurted. ""And exactly when is the proper time? On your honeymoon? I'm sorry, Edward, but by then it will be too late. No, she must know all of your secrets if this arrangement is to continue.""
 
 Through the years, I'd seen my friend in an agitated state on many occasions, but on this particular one, his desire for Eunice to know something that he himself had sworn me to never divulge, had pushed him far beyond the usual limit of his composure. We sat in an uncomfortable silence for several moments before he, having made his mind up on the matter, rose to his feet.
 
 ""If you do not tell Eunice everything this evening, I will,"" he threatened. ""And I will see to it that this relationship of yours is ended.""
 
 ""Malcolm, you know I can't-"" I'd never known him to react so irrationally on any matter before.
 
 ""Tell me what?"" Eunice had returned without our noticing. ""What are you two arguing about?""
 
 ""Edward will explain it all to you,"" Malcolm answered as he got up to leave, never taking his eyes from mine, his stare piercing me to the core.
 
 ""But why are you leaving?"" she asked, obviously disappointed.
 
 ""Edward has something important to talk to you about,"" he replied. ""And it would be best if I were not present. I'll check on you later, my dear."" He kissed her on the cheek, and quickly left the apartment before she could protest further.
 
 
 Eunice put the groceries on the coffee table, and sat down facing me; we remained that way in silence until she decided it was time for me to explain.
 
 ""Edward, what was Malcolm talking about? What do you have to tell me?"" she asked, wringing her hands nervously. ""Why did he leave?""
 
 ""Malcolm feels that there is some information that I must share with you, regarding my past,"" I said evenly.
 
 ""What information? Have you been lying to me?""
 
 ""My dishonesty with you is based in the omission of certain facts, rather than telling you lies, Eunice."" I had extreme difficulty looking at her as I spoke. ""I've been trying to protect you.""
 
 ""Protect me from what? What haven't you told me?"" I was shocked to detect anticipation in her voice, rather than apprehension; was something wrong, or was I simply attempting to rationalize not telling her the truth?
 
 ""It's difficult to put into words in a way that will make sense, Eunice,"" I said, stalling.
 
 ""Why don't you try,"" she said, with an urgency that seemed out of place. ""Or don't you think I should know everything, Edward?"" I was looking at her now, and her expression was one I'd never seen before; there was no fear or sadness, only a kind of hunger that felt wrong, especially for the Eunice I'd come to know.
 
 ""The love we share is something that I'd never want to put at risk, Eunice,"" I confessed. ""And if you truly love me, this should not be something that would drive a wedge-""
 
 ""Then I suggest you tell me right now!"" she spat, standing now. ""What is it?""
 
 The shadows that had at one point been banished from the apartment, had returned and seemed to be growing at the same rate as Eunice's agitation. I was beginning to feel like the subject of some kind of bizarre experiment.
 
 ""Why are you becoming so upset?"" I asked, as a headache began to press at my temples. ""Whether I tell you or not shouldn't change the feelings between us."" 
 
 There was a deep hum emanating from within the very walls of the apartment that carried with it a sinister, oppressive atmosphere and chanting voices; something unnatural was developing. Eunice had begun to tremble throughout her body, as though at any moment, she would violently erupt.
 
 ""Just fucking tell me!"" she roared, in a distinctly masculine, and yet oddly familiar voice.
 
 This was definitely not Eunice Adams standing before me, and a sickening feeling told me that I'd walked blindly into a trap.
 
 ""Who are you? What have you done with Eunice?""
 
 This creature, who only moments ago appeared to be the woman I loved, screamed with hateful rage and lunged at me with limbs that had become spindly, black tentacles; its formerly beautiful edifice was torn apart, revealing the trunk-like form, and numerous gruesome mouths of one of the hideous Dark Young that had roamed the woods behind Crowley Manor on that fateful night, months ago. I attempted to roll out of my seat to avoid the creature's frantic swinging, but one of the appendages caught me in the ribs, sending me flying into the far wall. Struggling to my knees, I saw the front door swing open and Malcolm stumbled inside, moaning and looking as though he had been poisoned.
 
 ""Malcolm!"" I screamed. ""Get away! She's one of them!""
 
 To my horror, Malcolm did not leave the apartment; he too began to turn black, and split himself apart, revealing another of the horrid creatures.
 
 Determining that my only means of escape would be the bedroom window, I began crawling toward the hallway, only to be blocked by the swift movement of the beast that used to be Malcolm; its tentacles closed around my neck, cutting off my ability to breathe. My vision blurred as I struggled to remain conscious, clawing to free myself from the thing's grip. A moment later, I lost that battle, and all went black.
 
 
 When light finally broke through the darkness, I could see the form of a broad-shouldered, matronly woman in a nurse's uniform standing over me, wiping sweat from my feverish brow. 
 
 ""Easy now, Mr. Montrose,"" she said softly. ""Your fever is breaking, and the doctor says that the hallucinations will pass with it.""
 
 ""Who are you?"" I screamed, flailing my arms. ""Where am I? Where's Eunice?""
 
 Two orderlies rushed to her side to restrain me as I struggled, while she administered a sedative which soon had the desired effect, and I fell back into a blessedly dreamless sleep.
 
 
 To say that I was later shocked to learn that I had been unconscious in the university infirmary for more than three months following my ordeal at Crowley Manor, would be an understatement, but that was what the nurse told me when I awoke. Judging from the manner in which she'd fumbled for answers to my questions as though under instruction not to provide any information without the approval of someone in authority, I was certain that my return from that cursed house was not in a state that I, and the Institute, would've wanted. When Malcolm appeared in my room, he confirmed for me that which I already suspected; Brother Jakob and his followers were not yet finished with me.
 
 ""Based on your rantings while in the grip of that fever, it would appear that the Dunwich cult are using any nefarious means at their disposal to gain some kind of knowledge from your mind, Edward,"" my old friend said, sadly. ""It's unfortunate that you had to endure such psychological torture, but we were powerless to break the spell.""
 
 ""They ripped through my mind for three months, Malcolm,"" I said, feeling violated. ""Three months! How could they possibly possess that kind of power?""
 
 ""Until you've been completely debriefed, I'm afraid that it will remain a mystery,"" Malcolm admitted, sounding hopeless. ""And we can't do anything about that until you're fully recovered. The shock may cause you much more harm.""
 
 Debriefing at the Institute is not the simple interview that mainstream agencies employ. It involved a physical and psychological probing of a subject's mind, and if that subject were in any way traumatized before the procedure, permanent damage could result. I knew that Malcolm desperately required every bit of information that I could provide, but if I was not fully healed going into it, I could lose my grip on sanity and be lost in the Void forever.
 
 ""I'll check on you in a couple of days,"" he offered. ""If you're well enough, we can proceed. Get some rest."" He got up to leave.
 
 ""Malcolm?""
 
 ""Yes?""
 
 ""Eunice Adams... was she... is she...,""
 
 ""Real?"" he already knew.
 
 ""Yes,"" I replied, hopeful. ""Is she?""
 
 My old friend sighed heavily, and shook his head. ""We'll talk in a couple of days, Edward. Until then, get some rest.""

591myr,1,2016-10-23,My GF [25 F] of now four years (LDR) never makes future plans nor time for me [26 M] for me &amp; prioritizes graduate school and volunteering.,bluebull1313,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/591myr/my_gf_25_f_of_now_four_years_ldr_never_makes/,"Hey guys, 

so I've been dating my GF for now a little longer than four years. We are living for three years in a LDR. After graduating (around 2 years ago) I got an job offer in my home country (just had to move basically to the other side of Sweden) while she still lives in the UK and just started graduate school. We met during my exchange semester in the UK around 4 1/2 years ago.  

Our LDR worked out pretty well actually (amazingly well compared to my LDR I had before). But things kind of changed by the beginning of this year. First my GF took an internship opportunity in the states for 7 months, times were rough sometimes but I still think it was a great opportunity for her. I supported her throughout the time. Visited her two times (flights ain't cheap) and also took some days off and I payed her flight from the UK to Sweden and back, once her internship ended. 

This was about three months ago. Ever since I feel like I have to beg in order to see her. I visited her in the UK a month after. We kind of had a bigger argument shortly after. Reason was to make it quick: 


- we planned three big dates this year to spend together: My Birthday, Christmas and New Year's Eve (we always spend the last two dates together)

-&gt; She volunteered at her grad school for some project and will be in China over New Year's (that was no problem at all, I still think it is a great opportunity and she definitely should go for that)

-&gt; Christmas, just a couple of days ago she told me she already made plans with friends she won't have time for me (we actually talked about it a couple of weeks earlier and she said that she will visit me)

-&gt; My birthday (I am one of the weird guy who likes his own birthday I usually just have a beer with friends or either my gf is around); she just told me she won't make it (she promised a couple of weeks ago that she really wants to celebrate with me and that I shouldn't make plans - so I didn't), because she is going to visit her friends back from undergraduate school. That was kind of a bummer for me because my birthday is actually at the beginning of next week.

What actually worries me is, that I feel like I am not a big part of her life anymore. She focuses so much on school, volunteering and work (which is of course good). We used to talk a lot about our future. I miss those talks....it's been a very long time since we had such talks....Skype calls/texting became so unfrequent. Mostly because she is either busy with already mentioned things or friends &amp; family. Please do not get a wrong impression of me. I value my family a lot as well and barely see them because of work and because I spent most of my days off this year with my gf.

We used to talk to make plans for trips and travel somewhere unknown and such. Our last trip-plan/idea got cancelled because she suddenly travelled to Chile suddenly around two months ago. I just feel like that everything is more important to her than our relationship. After our argument (which I mentioned above) she told me things will change and that she will make more time for me next year. She said that she has to do an internship for six months and will try to do it in Sweden....that is what she said....but deep inside I feel like that Sweden/me is not here priority.....I know that I can't proof it, but some of you might know that feeling...I already told her I can get her quite good contacts or even internship opportunities in my city, she said 'thanks' and that she will come back to that. 
Today she told me she is starting to volunteer for the red cross as well and will be in  South Africa for two or even three months next year as well (she plans to do so over her semester break - keep in mind, that thing with the internship will happen either way and worst case scenario: she will not be in Sweden). 

I don't know how to feel at the moment. She noticed that my mood switched when she told me about the red cross and she said that she would like to have a boyfriend who supports her in such things. (I supported her all the way ....not only this year...my personal life suffered as well...especially this year it did a lot and yes, I told her that). The only thought I had in my head was her words from our last argument where she promised that 'things will be different from next year on' and that she will 'make more time for me'. 

I know that especially school is very important and time consuming and work as well (I've been there as a student), but she doesn't notice how much I suffered for her this year. I feel like she only makes plans for herself and for her future. She said, during our last argument, that she wants to spend her future with me, but I just can't feel it. (BTW, I already sent out applications this year for job openings in the UK, but it is kind of though, because I currently work for the government and it isn't easy to switch countries and find a similar job.)

I don't know what do to nor to think. I just feel like I am fed up with such things. I always made time for her, postponed plans with friends and family for her.

I was just thinking that you guys could maybe give me an advice regarding this topic. Or maybe there are holes in the way I observe our relationship and you could give me any advice of things I might do wrong.

(FYI, dunno if it is relevant, I did voluntary internships after my exchange semester in the UK in order to spend another eight months with her there.)

I am really thankful for any answers!

TL;DR LDR for over four years, gf does not include me in her future plans, only make plans that might benefit her, I feel like I have to run after her, she makes promises but barely holds them



______________________________________________

UPDATE: Today she told me she actually already applied and had an interview with the red cross and probably will leave for South Africa some time next year. Not sure how to feel about that since we just talked about our relationship goals (and honesty) last week. 

My mind is totally messing me up right now. If she tells me such things only after a month what else can I assume is happening in her life. Now I feel like I really don't play any role in her life."
592p7d,17,2016-10-24,I feel like I've failed to grow socially and it's inhibiting my ability to succeed in college,PiroulineStick,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/592p7d/i_feel_like_ive_failed_to_grow_socially_and_its/,"Before having to move to SC, I had a pretty great life in NY with which I couldn't complain about. I did excellent in high school, I had a small group of friends I've been with forever. 

Then the move happened. I moved before my senior year of high school, had to spend it with a bunch of people I don't know 700 miles away from home. I still loath my parents a little for making me go through this.

Now I am in the middle of my first semester at a women's liberal arts college. This college is pretty demanding and encourages students to volunteer, do internships, and attend convocations, some of which are mandatory for a grade or you will be fined. This wouldn't be too bad if I actually had a friend or two to do said events with. 

I've never had such a hard time making friends before in my life. It's like my social skills haven't developed at all past a 5th grade level and I can't spark interesting conversation with anyone at all. I don't initiate conversations with people I think I could click with for fear of bothering them, and no one even initiates conversations with me either. Having the same old group of friends in NY, we would always volunteer together and enjoy it. Now I'm too scared to volunteer alone because I fear no one would bother to help me out if I needed any assistance. I guess I was never able to notice just how bad I am at making friends since I've surrounded myself with the same few all throughout middle school and high school.

I know going to college is a choice, but my parents are pushing me really hard to go through with it so that someone in our family can finally have a degree. I never would have guessed I would be forced to befriend professors, go to their houses for dinner with my class, attend events on campus which I don't even live on (my commute is 45 minutes and I chose not to dorm because I know my anxiety and mood swings would be unbearable for any roommate). Of course, in public I can contain any stress I have, but I need my personal space to clear my head and cry it out which is why I chose not to dorm.

I honestly don't know what else to do. I feel like a little bitch for complaining about doing things that may actually benefit me and shape me to become a better person, but it's just so hard doing this completely alone. I wouldn't mind going to these mandatory events more optimistically if I knew I wouldn't have any trouble being social, but even when I try to talk to others they just shy away, even for the smallest, most general statements or questions I make. I wish I knew why everyone seems to avoid me; my looks are average, I dress normally, I speak clearly, I have good hygiene and I've been told to be really funny.

 I wish I could get closure as to why I'm so unlikable.

5935bu,1,2016-10-24,"Me [20 F] with my boss [40s M], I'm quickly contracting a huge crush and I need to kill it with fire.",freakydeakyintern,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5935bu/me_20_f_with_my_boss_40s_m_im_quickly_contracting/,"This problem is honestly just so cliche that I hate myself for having it, but here we are.

I recently started an internship in my field and I'm continuing part time during the school year. I answer to a few people, but one man, Sinbad, is my primary boss and mentor. He's been so generous about assigning me to projects that align with my long-term career aspirations and pushing my involvement in higher-level work than I'd have any right to expect. His advocacy on my behalf has made this internship a perfect fit for me.

He's also physically *exactly* my type, experienced in a lot of areas of our field that I find fascinating, quietly funny, and generally the most appealing man I've ever met. And, you know, married with children, my direct superior, and twice my age.

Look, I'm so used to being the only woman in a room; I know how to avoid giving people the wrong impression and reject unwanted attention. What I don't know is how to hide it when I'm interested in someone I have no business wanting. I'm expansive and effusive and very much an open book, and now that has the potential to screw over a productive professional relationship. 

I should admit that I have a tendency to idolize older, accomplished, articulate men. I'm very conscious of my own lack of life experience, and I find people who are actually old enough to be interesting extremely appealing. Usually, though, they're professors with whom I have much more limited contact, whereas I see Sinbad for hours every day. We have long conversations, go to lunch together (in groups), and work at close quarters for the whole day. I get giddy over his praise, captivated by his expertise, distracted by his physical presence. I'm really worried that my crush will be painfully obvious and compromise my career and his, decrease my competence at my job, and make him uncomfortable.

I've tried dating boys my age; I'm seeing a few people casually and find all of them desperately boring. At this point they're basically a sexual stopgap. They're all intelligent and accomplished for our age, but that doesn't compare to an actual adult with his shit together. None of them ever say things that surprise or intrigue me.

So, Reddit, how the hell do I conceal and smother my feelings for this guy without sacrificing the opportunity to learn from him and benefit from his esteem for my abilities? Is there some kind of specialized lobotomy for this kind of thing?

  **tl;dr**: Completely infatuated with my boss, need to know how to get rid of these feelings, or at the very least hide them until emotion chip removal is covered by my insurance."

We were school mates when I was very young (that was in 1998 or something), then we never seen each other again until 2011. That was when I got introduced to her by a then-mutual friend (then we remembered each other, school and everything). 

I used to be in a grey/FwB relationship with that mutual. To cut it short, I gave up on having unhealthy relationships years ago. She used to have this kind of relationship with me while she was in a relationship with her ""boyfriend"", I didn't know much about it though. It was very messed up. Not sure much of this is relevant but she's a bad person. It had a really bad effect on me. 

Now, couple of years ago I decided to cut all ties with that person, gently, so that I avoid having another on/off abusive relationship with her.

Back to the girl I'm dating. Since we got introduced back in 2011 and we've been on some kind of on/off talks. We talk for a month and then we don't, etc. Some events happened that brought us together (like, we, surprisingly, got an internship in the same company so we had a chance to see each other, that was in 2012. Then we talk for a couple of months then I stop (also **she was in a relationship** back then, so I didn't just cut off.)

But since a month or so, we started talking and we really took it to a deeper level. I think she's a good person. I hope so.

**The issue is: ** she still considers that girl her ""best friend"" and she keeps mentioning her. And I'm deeply concerned and in a dilemma. Now this is what I've been thinking: she seems good, but she considers this ""bad"" person to be her best friend. Does this mean that she's been influenced by her friend? Does this mean that they are alike? I don't want to re-open this, or re-attach these ties with that person; she's her best friend so most likely if I went forward I would have to meet her someday. I don't know if I'd be too ideal to think that I should not judge people through their friends, but I don't know.

Also, I still don't know if she knows all this about her friend. **If I try to be honest and tell her** it might be too early and I'm not sure of consequences. If she agrees to have her as a friend and she'd be okay with us meeting, etc. I'll be having a problem. 

**If I try not to tell her**, I might slowly bring the other girl into my life. And I'm pretty sure if I took this to a higher level I'd like her to not be influenced by her ""best friend"".

So this is a long one but met me get it out.

At the beginning of this year, I left my fiance to start a relationship with a different girl and move to a different state for a new job in a field I love (omitted for confidentiality, if you PM I will state it). I loved working from home but my paranoia about providing for us began to set in, along with a deep depression stemming from all the emotions that finally decided to come out because I finally have someone that loves me and is willing to listen and be there for me.

But, I became distant, suicidal and kept bottling up my emotions. My partner (now fiance) has stuck with me through, knowing that this isnt who I am and that we will make it through together. 

Just as things were becoming stable, I got news that my job was moving back to the state I previously moved from, and we were merging with a different and larger firm. I was very disappointed and to be honest extremely hurt when I also found out that this merger was planned from the moment I joined onto the company.

I thought things would be better up here as I realized there was potential for a raise, one that I thought would be more substantial along with the opportunity to rise up and take on more things and move forward in this field I love. 

Well thats when things really started to go downhill. I was offered substantially less than I expect, barely 2k more than I already made. I had to fight to get relocation expenses covered, and felt (and still feel) cheated out of the whole thing.

Now that I am in this new firm I feel more like an intern than a hard working analyst. I work in a spare conference room (soon I am getting moved to a terrible cubicle with a large pole in it , just because someone wants the better desk that is opening up, i know this is trivial but pisses me off because I came from a peaceful home office to barely doing nothing here), barely doing anything all day to be honest, nearly begging people for any work to keep me productive and get my billing rates back to 90+% like the were before. If this is how it will be, I would rather to work from home doing work rather than spending $203 a month an 2-3 hours each day commuting back and forth from work. 

I feel that I am asking to learn more things to help me succeed, and all that I am getting in return are ""maybe"", ""no"" and silence. There have been comments about those with ADHD (Which I have), made by others in the office that have made me felt put down also, along with a general premise of hate towards me. 

What is pushing me to write this more so is that I figured out the reason I got cheated out of a higher salary. It was because of my degree, even though I have extreme interest in the field and know more than the engineers here that get paid higher than me. 

I started the year off with high dreams and hopes. I was planning on traveling the world and finally doing research and talking with people across the globe to help them with their needs (with out being a rich savior- that is a different rant though). Now I come home exhausted, depressed and barely have anytime to read or do anything I love to do. Most days I don't feel like doing it at all, which has killed my love for exercise and contributed to a large weight increase in the past year. Started crying nearly everyday because I have a distrust of therapists and feel like everyone really does not want to hear what I have to say.

I'm not suicidal right now. After my scare in June I cant even bear the thought of going through with it. 

I want to strive to work for my self, but I have no idea where to turn or how to use my skills. I feel more like a thinker than a doer and it pisses me off everyday. I need an out and people I can trust to make it happen. 

So thats what I have been holding in forever. Feel free to give advice, no matter how blunt it is. "

That same day (friday) we lunched with a group of people from my class and there was some sort of connection right away. On my first day of school (monday) we started talking to each other and she gave me her number. Later that day she also said that she had a boyfriend already, not specifically to me because she was new to the people in my class who have known each other longer. (I'm currently not in relationship by the way)

For the past few months we have been texting and talking a lot. We hit it off really well at school (talking, eye contact, laughing and such), because she there is never a dull moment in our conversation. We've also been sharing things with each other, like what we're doing in the evening and on the weekends. We also cycle home from school often, because she lives in the same traveling direction (but different towns) as me, and we also have good private conversations at that time.

The situation right now is that I personally think it is awesome what is happening, because I never had much contact like this with girls. The only thing that is keeping me back from going towards possibly dating is the fact that she has a boyfriend (I don't know who it is and have never met him before).

TL;DR: On the 14th of november, we're both going on an internship till the 3rd of february (different towns). It will be highly unlikely that I'll be seeing her during that time, so the only contact will be through texting. I'd like to have clear how our relationship is before the 14th of november. From how it looks like, she might be slightly interested in me, because of the following reasons:
* she gave me her number herself, which was kind of unexpected for me, especially because she has a boyfriend
* we laugh a lot together and share a lot of the same views and interests
* we text a lot (we both start the conversation)
* we also help each with subjects from school (I'm mostly tutoring her, because she has to retake some of this years subjects)

I already discussed this with friends from school (who know her) and friends outside school (they don't know her) and both groups say I should figure out how she feels about me. I'm 22 (male) and never had a girlfriend, so I'm looking for all the advice I can get on this. "
595bd3,76,2016-10-24,"Me [24 F] with my BF [24 M] 3yrs, his physical problem is ruining us",sadboyfriendthrow,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/595bd3/me_24_f_with_my_bf_24_m_3yrs_his_physical_problem/,"Hello All,

I've been with my boyfriend Rob for 3 years. The first entire year was  a honeymoon period. It was blissful. Shortly before we began dating, he suffered an injury to his groin during sex with a girl he was dating at the time. It resulted in pain initially, and since then it has become worse, and worse, and worse. He's been to several urologists who have kind of dismissed it, and finally was just referred to one by a doctor who seems to be taking him more seriously than anyone else before; however, it seems to be soft tissue damage that may not be repairable. 

The first summer after we started dating, we were completing internships in different locations. When we came back to school for our last year, Rob was entirely a different person. Moody, grumpy, sad, distracted. He opened up to me about what was going on, and I tried to be there for him to talk to me, but I am the only person he has told, and it was just getting to be too much for me. We would talk about it every day, he would endlessly hash out the things he had read online and the inner mechanisms of the male anatomy and I started feeling physically sick every time he would start talking about it again because it wasn't just a ""my junk hurts today, and I'm sad,"" it was, ""I can't focus on anything today, because this is happening. Here is a verbal review of everything I've ever read online, again. Here are all of the symptoms I have experienced and the chronology of their appearance, again."" The night before I graduated from college, I spent what was supposed to be my celebration dinner with him listening to him talk about recent articles he had read about the way male anatomy functions and what he believed his issues could be.

He has become so different from the person he was before. We talk about marriage, and future plans, but he is so depressed. It affects him every minute of every day. He's a lot quieter than he was before, until he starts talking about this issue, then it goes on and on. He's much more irritable; he raised his voice at me for the first time a few months ago and it's happened three times again since then. It happens when I want to talk about our relationship and he's not in the proper head-space for it. I don't want to be in a relationship where I have to monitor his feelings to determine whether or not it's a good time to tell him I miss him. 

Our lives took a turn where we had to become a long-distance couple about a year ago. It's been going pretty well, all things considered, but every time I visit him, there is at least one entire night that is just shot because it's too hot, and Rob is overwhelmed with sensation, or we made the mistake of having sex, and he's in pain that doesn't allow him to focus on anything else. He can't sit, stand, or lay down without experiencing pain. To try to help out, I have offered to refrain from sex every time we get to see each other (about once every 2 months for a long weekend) but the vast majority of the time he changes his mind in the moment and wants to do it and it's hard to resist that. I know this sub promotes a lot of different kinds of sex other than PIV, but that kind is just so important to me and this is really difficult. If he were the same old Rob and we related the same way, I feel like I would miss it much less because I would still have my wonderful boyfriend. Last time I insisted that we not have PIV sex, and the time before that I refused to do it more than once, so we've had sex only once since May, but it hasn't made a difference. I am supposed to move near him in six months, but I've told him I cannot move down there unless he starts therapy.

I do not mean to sound callous, or uncaring. I know this entry is very self-focused. I also know I have no understanding of the depth of suffering Rob is experiencing. It has plunged him into a giant depression that is horrible to watch. It breaks my heart that he feels this way. It clearly is wearing him down. I cannot stand to see him suffer.

I initially had every intention of staying by him while he figured this out, but he refuses to go to therapy to talk to someone about the way this is affecting him mentally; he says that if it's not helping him physically it won't help him mentally. I keep telling him he needs some tools to help him deal with the cycling thoughts; it does him no good to wonder if there was anything he could have done 3 and a half years ago to help stop this. He's told me I would be better off without him, and I am starting to think he's right. Not because of his physical condition, because I would make every possible adjustment to avoid causing him additional pain, but because it's just becoming so difficult.

I just don't know what to do. Please help. Is there anything I can tell him or any way that I can adjust that will help him? What can I do to help him get to therapy?

595es6,1,2016-10-24,M4F - Something Rough and Fun - Pick a Character!,MyDirtyDirtyDPP,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/595es6/m4f_something_rough_and_fun_pick_a_character/,"OK DPP, it's confession time: I work in law, and while that sounds exciting to people when they first hear it, law is pretty boring. I don't work in an exciting field, I don't get exciting cases; I live pretty well but it's not exactly fun. In fact it's pretty damn stuffy. The rest of my life's pretty much the same way - I work, I jog, I meet clients, and sometimes I have vanilla sex.

Maybe that's why in my downtime I'm spending more and more time thinking about how much I'd love to just *wreck* some of the women in my life. Facefuck them, cockslap them, gag them, call them names, pound the shit out of them... You get the drill, and I'd love for someone to play one of them for my pleasure.

I've selected my five favourites for you to choose from and listed a little about them below. Pics are available of all of them if you need a little inspiration before you choose:

**Kirsty**
The bitchy, bleach-blonde daughter of one of the senior partners. Her family sent her to the best schools, the best colleges, nothing but the best, but she revels in being a bitchy blonde bimbo who knows she'll never have to work a day in her life. She's also a total attention whore who knows her cute looks and important name get her places, and that drives everyone at the firm who isn't getting ahead on name alone absolutely crazy, and even annoys some of her own family!

Scene idea: Her dad cuts off her credit card and the job he got her at an upscale clothing store just doesn't cut it for a girl like her. She decides to make him mad by coming on to one of his employees, but gets way more than she expected - she thought he'd just get told that she was flirting with his employees, but she ends up getting a nasty perverted fucking that she loves every second of!

**Jess**
Kirsty's rock chick younger sister. 18 and full of attitude, she takes no shit and isn't afraid to backtalk anyone. Jess hates Alex's guts and would do anything to get one over on her, and hates that her dad makes her spend so much time at the office stuffing envelopes while her sister gets to spend all the family's money and do absolutely nothing. Doesn't he know that hanging around all these stuffed shirts takes time away from her band?

Scene idea: She's sick of her goody-goody little sister getting all the praise. She's had to work twice as hard for half the attention, and the only way she's going to make up the difference is with shock and awe: Getting one of her dad's employees to fuck the shit out of her in the most obscene ways, and call up her stupid family and tell them what she's doing while she's doing it!

**Lucy**
The studious and preppy intern. A late night at the office is her idea of a good time and anything other than constant study is a wild weekend for her. Though she doesn't really know it - or at least doesn't pay attention to it - she's actually a little pocket rocket; short and cute with dark blonde hair, her boobs are *huge* and no matter how she dresses she can't help but show them off - either that or they're just too big to hide!

Scene idea: Part of her internship here means we get her to take exams. She's so desperate to pass her end of year assessment that, despite all her study, she breaks into the records room when she thinks nobody else is in the building to look at the results previous interns got so she can copy the answers. When I catch her, there's no limit of what she'll do to get me to not ruin her future career.

**Kayla**
Personal trainer for a few people at the firm. She's a pretty, confident blonde with flexibility and stamina to burn. Being 5' 2"" hasn't stopped her being super feisty, and the hours she spends in the gym makes her think that she's a match for anyone, man or woman, who tries to take her on. All those hours spent around toned men take their toll, though, and finishing work super-horny with nobody to take it out on is a common occurrence.

Scene idea: I decide to widen my workout routine and drop by to see her at the 24 hour gym after a late night at work. She knows that the best way to tone up is with some MMA training, so she decides to show me a few holds. Things get a little competitive, one thing leads to another, and she ends up getting used as a personal workout tool!

**Kim**
An ambitious and attractive associate who's more than willing to use her looks to get ahead - to the point of getting herself some big fake tits to either better impress the bosses or better influence judges. She is a stone cold bitch and there's nothing she won't do to climb the latter, no matter who she has to step on to get there.

Scene idea: Its only me and her working late at the office and she wants to get away to go and schmooze at a party for the partners that's happening down the street. She tries to dump her work off on me, first by basically demanding I do it when she doesn't have the authority and then trying to use her looks to convince me. Unfortunately for her she only convinces me to do something else.

All ideas are optional and negotiable, and we can either adjust my scenarios or come up with our own. My main interests are listed above, but today I'm into anything rough and nasty you can think of! (with the usual exceptions of pee, poop and death) 

This is a standing prompt, so feel free to message me any time you find it, and I'm happy for one-offs or for us to work through more than one character. If this prompt is old when you read it, I might even have new characters for you to play - feel free to ask!

Hopefully this isn't too long and you're still reading; if any of my ideas turn you on or you want to know more, drop me an orange envelope.

Happy writing!"

I don't even know who I am anymore.,jomavi12,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/595lo1/my_life_has_become_a_rollercoaster_of_emotions_i/,"I have been depressed for three months now. I have just finished college so I am in the middle of a gap year, I am learning a new language, going to the gym and soon I'll start with my internship. My main problem right now is that I am spending too much time alone (my roomates have lessons/work) and I can't avoid keep thinking about my problems.

I used to be really happy, I had a girlfriend which I absolutely trusted and I was living in another country for a while where I met tons of new people and had a great time. Things couldn't be better until in the period of 2 months a friend of mine died, my then-girlfriend cheated on me, I had family problems (my dad was really close to fell in depression again and I had to cheer him up on the distance) and I had to come back to my country leaving awesome friends which I probably will never see again.

Was just too much stuff at the same time. I am a good person, I try to help everybody out when they need something. I treat everybody the same way. I am not expecting feedback from the Universe, but I just don't deserve to be like this.

I spent an horrible 1-2 months, long morning in the bed without energy to wake up, knowing that everything will be the same out there. But right now some days I feel full of energy, really confident about myself, and some other days, like today, I just feel really bad, without ambicions, without anything to do in this world, without a plan.

Does anyone have felt like this? Is this normal?

Thank you."

I have a lot of purchases in mind once I graduate, but being a bit of a WW2 buff, #1 on my list is an M1 Garand.  

Now I've read a lot on this sub about Garands from the CMP and I want to take advantage of this. I would just wait until I graduate and have my own place, but I've heard that they are running out. So a couple questions. 

1. Am I too late? The CMP website shows out of stock on all the field, rack, and service grade Garands.

2. Is it worth the hassle of getting it now, or should I just wait until I graduate?

I ask this because I don't think I'm allowed to keep it in my apartment on campus and my parents would balk at the idea of keeping a firearm in the house (or me purchasing one in the first place). I would have to figure out some other way to store it. Additionally, if the rifle takes several months to ship I may be away in another state for a summer internship.

TL;DR does the CMP still have Garands and should I get one now or wait"

And like the rest of America I was all board mocking Donald Trump. I am a Millennial and I was apathetic to this election. I got my election news from late night shows. They were all very negative toward Donald, but Seth Meyers and Stephen Colbert were extra vicious. I occasionally tuned into CNN to see what's going on. Eventually, I noticed a pattern, the news network all out blitz of Donald Trump. They make mountain out of molehills of what he said. That made me questioned their trustworthiness and I started to pick up my news through the internet instead of tv networks. I then noticed a greater discrepancy and the out of context the news network purposeful misconstruction of Donald Trump.

Hillary corruption is no where to be seen on network tv, yet all you hear about are the women accusing Donald Trump. How ridiculous. And at this point everyone is sick of that dead beat horse, yet the news network are still talking about it. See all these politicians and talking heads go on and make a holier than thou speech of the locker room talk. People saying it's not locker room. It's not locker room, it's guys talks. Unfortunately, that is what guys are talking about. I do not talk that way, but the older men that I worked with definitely talk like that. Being millennial, I grew up with an appreciation for feminism and respect for all people. But we can't help it that the older generation still have that view. I had bosses like that, they like you and wanted to impress you that you're so young, they talk like that. At worst, Donald is the perverted uncle now that his locker room talk is public. It's harmless. He goes in for a greeting kiss and take a sniff, he hugs and imagine things in his head. Like if you had a friend that's into MILF, you would be uncomfortable with him hanging around your mom, because you know what he's thinking, but he's still your friend. Or if all of a sudden you know of your friend fetish. It's embarrassing, but it's harmless.

What's not harmless is the unbound corruption of Hillary and her peeps. She is the DNC. The 08 election was set up for her until an unknown charismatic black man upset her. The people around her is corrupted to the core with the 0 sense of the real world. Her loyalist are polical sci major, intern for a democrat, and stayed a lifetime politician. She and her people are clueless. The recent project veritas summed it up, she thought the Donald Duck mascot was clever and all her people praising her yessing at it. Anyone with a clue, would see that as lame af.

What Donald Trump really resonates with me, and I wish he would spend more time going over it, are his policies. I really want to Drain the Swamp. We need to limit these lifelong politicians. Our great country need fresh bloods to carry this country forward. Right now, we have people on the board of Technology that have no clue about techs. We have underhanded deals without interest of the people. We gotta stop these things. We need to negotiate deals that would MAGA, not the stupid I scratch your back you scratch mine of old politics.

So this election come down to who do you want to lead? On one hand you have a rich perverted uncle that you feel uncomfortable around when he makes sexist jokes (although you do laugh occasionally at it), but then is set on fighting injustice and balance the playing field. Or your lame aunt that is out of touch, but keeps insisting she's still in. Other than that she's lovely around you, except she heads a sinister corruption machine that will weaken your beloved country.

I pick the rich uncle. I pick him even though I have the opposite view of him regarding abortion and religion. I'm uneasy about him choosing conservative judges to the Supreme Court. I accept people with different perspectives and principles than mine, I just can't accept people that are two face."

Like many others I only have my statuses updated to referred or reviewed and I began back in summer. Do they update the status' after this point or is that it? I have been applying to the stem engineer / computer scientist (recent graduate) posts I would see posted by the army airforce or navy for civilians. Sadly, I havent heard anything other than recently getting an email with a rating of 84 for GS5 in an email which I have no idea what it indicates other than qualifying. I also heard that federal resumes are much different than your typical resume. What are perfect examples that I can follow to improve my chances? I can post my resume if need be. Currently only work at the same location and aside from that I have been a professor assistant, done both school projects and personal projects. I dont think projects should be included as experience but correct me if I am wrong. Anything would be helpful to get the ball rolling! (:"

This season I've since graduated school and gotten a full time position which requires much less typing and mousework. I have peaked at P1 50lp and wonder how much of a difference perhaps 130 WPM typing versus 105 would make on my ranking. Anyone else have this happen to them? I have found that if I warm up by typing and clicking around it makes a tremendous difference in game.... But I'm still not as quick as last year.

597fdu,2,2016-10-24,[Help] Taking dog on summer internship?,brave_new_squirrels,dogs,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/597fdu/help_taking_dog_on_summer_internship/,"I'm a college student who is graduating in a year and a half. I've started looking at summer internships, and I might have the opportunity to work at a dream company of mine. The only issue is, I'd have to relocate for the internship. Although I have enough saved up to relocate for the summer, I'm debating what to do with my dog. I would love to take him with me, but I want to be sure that it's the right decision.
  
He's a 3 year old Australian Shepherd, although he is VERY lazy for his breed. He sleeps all day and only needs one hour of walking a day. My main concern with leaving him home is that he is prone to aggression with new people and dogs, and I don't believe my parents can handle him. I've done A LOT of training to get him to to ignore his triggers, and I'm worried that my parents will undo most of that training. They're not good at interpreting his body language, and they will let him get away with bad behavior because it's easier than correcting it.

I understand that it probably will be difficult having a reactive dog in an apartment, but I think it might be a good opportunity to get some consistent training. His issues are almost completely gone, except inside the house. Without my parents enabling his bad behavior, I'd be able to work more on his issues. We also compete in agility, so I'd look into finding a trainer for the summer at the new location. This should help make the transition easier for him.

Again, money isn't really an issue for me, I have plenty to support both of us for the summer. Ultimately, I just want to do what's best for him. There's nothing set in stone yet, so I may not even get the internship. However, I'd like to get input on the idea of taking him with before I decide on the internship. Also, any advice to help make the transition be easier for him if I do accept it would be appreciated. Thanks in advance!

597s2r,0,2016-10-24,Am I doomed to the friend zone?,College1994kid,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/597s2r/am_i_doomed_to_the_friend_zone/,"I cannot tell if my friend (girl) is into me or if I'm in the friend zone.  I've listed the factors for my confusion and hope you have some thoughts!

I think she's into me:
--My girl bff (who had a crush on me) told this girl that she was going to ask me out.  This girl was adamant against that and they were friends since.
--At out student gov inauguration, we were wearing the same colors and she pointed that out multiple times.
--At a huge party day at school she same into my room and begged me to go with her to take shots.
--She looks though my Twitter bio and will comment and pick on me for it on Twitter
--The first week of class we worked on a lot of projects together.
--we always ask one another if we want to walk together to meetings or drive together.
-- She frequently offers for me to hang out and drink with her and her friends.
--I sent her a picture of me in a tux and her response was ""daaannng boooiii""
--She sent me a snap with obvious cleavage showing and tbh she doesn't ever show that and isn't that gifted there.
--This girl's friend would send my girl bff random snaps of this girl, likely poking fun that I like her and not my friend.
--She picks on me during meetings and sits next to me.
--At lunch she made a comment about me holding her hand and I laughed (thinking joke) and she seemed actually sad.
--I sent her a snap of me and my friend hanging out and she immediately came right over.
--I'm away for the semester and she tells me how successful I am (I have a prominent internship) and she tells people where I'm an intern.

Reasons why I question her feelings:

--last year at that big drinking party, she told me she didn't like me more than a friend, BUT she says she doesn't remember anything from that night.
--She told me one of my mentees is cute.
--She doesn't always respond to my snapchats and at times doesn't continue the texting convo.
--This past weekend when we were out drinking and having a ton of fun, we met two days later to chat for fun before I left.  When I left she randomly texted me and said at the bar she tried to set me up with a ""really pretty"" girl then but she was engaged.  

Not sure if that was genuine or if she wanted to see my response, like if I'd give her a sign I liked her instead.

Ideas and advice? I'm thinking of just telling her how I feel.

59853w,1,2016-10-24,How important is the school if I'm uninterested in big law?,amberlyjade20,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/59853w/how_important_is_the_school_if_im_uninterested_in/,"Background: I'm 23 years old and have a bachelors in computer science. I was fairly involved my last two years in undergrad. I was on a research team, a member of one CS organization, and in a mathematics honor society. I graduated with a 3.7 GPA. I took an internship at a large company in Huntsville, AL my last summer as a student. I graduated on a Saturday and walked into my office at another large company in Huntsville, AL on Monday. After being with the company almost a year, I've received one bonus and a raise, but I'm feeling somewhat unfulfilled already. I mostly chose this path because it was a practical choice. The job market is there. The money is there. In this area, technology is huge. 

I have a friend in law school so I've seen a lot of the work. I know it's time consuming and difficult, but I find it very interesting. From looking at her stuff, I think I'd be most interested in civil law. I know IP or patent is a great area for tech people, but is there a demand for it in smaller areas? Is there any sort of market for criminal law focusing on cyber crimes? I took a practice LSAT without any studying or looking at anything and made a 154. I'd hope to improve that score with studying, but how accurate are the practice tests? 

I don't have any experience in this field. Everything I've done at this point is geared towards technology. Would that be a factor as far as getting in? 

I want to stay in Alabama for school, and I'd plan to practice here. I'm hoping I could probably get into either of the smaller schools here with quite a bit of it paid for or I could study super hard for the LSAT and shoot for going to the U of Alabama which is top 30 but have nothing paid for. I know the better school is a big deal, but how much would it really hurt if I really just want to stay in Alabama at a small firm? I have no undergrad debt and would like to keep the debt as low as possible. 

I know I may be jumping the gun here since I haven't even taken the LSAT yet, but I want to weigh my options and think about every possibility early. "
598t9n,2,2016-10-24,No one knows,nackiroots,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/598t9n/no_one_knows/,"I started really struggling with depression during my last semester of college. I was taking 18 hours and working 20+ hours as an intern, and I was completely stressed out all the time. I was applying to jobs and taking phone interviews, but never getting any offers. I struggled to get out of bed in the morning. 

I started dating someone a few weeks before graduation, and things got a little better, but that didn't last long. I was able to continue working at my internship full time, but I didn't want to stay there permanently. I continued to look for jobs, and got an offer, but declined it due to a lot of negative things. I watched friend after friend get a job they were super excited about. 

I struggled a lot with not knowing what I wanted to do with my life. I had no idea where I wanted my career to go. 

I finally got an offer that I accepted, and moved to a new city a few hours away. Luckily, my boyfriend also moved there. I thought things would get so much better, starting a new job in a new city. But I was wrong. 

I come home from work and feel drained. I sit on the couch and watch Netflix until I make myself go to bed, only to get up and repeat the same thing. Every day. Me and my boyfriend hardly see each other, except on the weekend. I don't have any friends here. 

The only thing that's keeping me going is fear that people will know something is wrong with me. I keep up appearances on social media and say the right thing when people ask questions. No one knows the pain and emptiness I feel. I want someone to know, but I can't find the words. "

*It was a cool crisp day in the facility. There thermostat was cranked to the business standard 70 degrees, the pneumonia tubes were operational, and all of the lights were fully operational*

*Fliers were plastered all over the facility by interns: An open trial involving Klopp. A picture of him with a monocle, a handlebar mustache, and devil horns is adorned on every poster, with the caption: Unsung hero, or Grumpy Offender?, Along with the time of the trial*

*A large gathering was already nearby. Many interns had taken the rows of the prosecution, though there was plenty of seating to be filled, while only the six other Klopp's filled the defendant's rows. Oddly, A lawyer for Klopp was not there, at all. However, the prosecution seems to be a Rempton security captain. He had the look of a man happy with his life, with a certain glow that generally could put anybody towards a good mood. Scratching his stubble, he and his lawyer were already discussing as the court doors swing open*

*Klopp, in an orange jumpsuit was forced in by facility security officers. Bound by handcuffs, he walked in and took a seat, grumbling. The jury was livid, already professing their anger towards Klopp before the judge slammed his gavel against the glorified coaster*

Judge: ""Klopp, You stand trial of multiple counts of verbal harassment, assault, and negligence of others. You have made multiple multiple decisions and multiple charges of attempted murder on your rap sheet. Yet, you have never been imprisoned because you claim to have a role in this facility, no?""

Klopp: ""I do have a role in this facility, while you're busy powdering that shriveled testicle you call a face!""

*The judge, taken aback, took a deep breath before continuing*

Judge: ""Klopp, you DO understand that you are under prosecution for precisely what you said?""

K: ""what? You mean the truth that the only reason you're married is for the fuckton of undeserved income you get? My tax dollars pay your salary, asshole!""

JG: ""Your insults have no place In this court. You are here to justify if your innocent or not!""

*Klopp stood up, and began walking around, preparing another of his speeches*

K: ""Okay, say that you've just learned that, after building a life support system that weighs a ton, you end up in a facility, confused, scared, and lost. With nothing better to do, you start repairing the facility. From your years of twenty four all the way to nearly forty five, you have been shot, stabbed, burned, scalded, drowned, and have collected enough scars from your line of work that you're a walking callous""

JG: ""Klopp, this has nothing to do with the court session, explain your innocence!""

K: ""I was getting there! You're more impatient than toddler with ADHD. As I was saying, you gain many scars when future generations eventually come into the facility through portals, forcing you to learn that you, yourself, are ultimately the cause of the apocalypse""

*The judge raised an eyebrow, before sighing angrily*

JG: ""yes?""

K: ""So, what else to do, than to start voicing your opinions, gripes, complaints, and criticisms of other workers before you die a horrible death in the hands of one that you have been planning to kill for a very long time""

JG: ""that is another first degree murder charge right there.""

K: ""shut up! God forbid I have a bucket list of the wisdom I would prefer to share in order to lead these weak minded sheep you call the human race to leading independent minds and lives!""

*The jury was enraged, yelling, cursing, booing, throwing drinks at and shaming Klopp, who stood there before the judge, as calmly as Klopp ever gets. The Rempton security captain for Klopp to sit down, to which he eventually obliged, as the officer stood up*

ESO: ""your Honor. This here Klopp has might as well already confessed his crimes. He's clearly guilty beyond the shadow of a doubt. From verbally and physically abusing other members because of his pure unbridled rage, and to count that he has never attended any of the anger management classes or the medicines prescribed to him""

*The judge smiled wickedly.*

JG: ""Is this true, Klopp?""

K: ""what, I actually want to be myself? God forbid! You weak minded sheep just wanna shut out the negativity in your lives, and think yourselves perfect! You all are just fucking idiots, that's what I think!

JG: ""Klopp. You are aware that the sheer amount of crimes you have committed, by an arethmitec standpoint, exceed any punishment allowed by American law, yes?""

K:""Oh, so I get the green mile? Good! Gimme a last wish though, and allow me to kill that assist, Uncloak! He's committed crimes far worse than me!""

JG: ""He lives outside of our galaxy and thus we have no tangibility over him. Do NOT change the subject""

K: ""this is exactly why I support building the fucking wall!""

JG: ""SHUT UP!""

*The judge was seething, leaning over past his podium, a spider crawling the ridiculous powdered monstrosity that he called a wig. Soon, the judge sat down, and continued*

JG: ""Klopp. Your punishment must be far worse than death, to force you to atone for the atrocities you have committed. I hereby Ommit you of your maintenance level security clearance, your income, and Your title as a facility member!""

*Klopp stood there, shocked before jumping up to the podium, being seized by the guards, and eventually pinned in the worst way possible*

JG: ""I am not done. From this day forward, you will be transformed into the very creature you hate, the one being that you think could be left out and let humanity continue unhindered. You will become an anthro""

*Silence fell over the courtroom. Every single Member aside from the player characters were passing glances to eachother, as Eustace and Halligan had already left the room. For a full minute, nothing was heard save for the continuous clicking of the clock, before the judge continued*

""You will be forced to wear a collar, as well. If it notices any change in your DNA to return you to your previous state, you will be shocked. Same goes for magic ways to return you, you will be shocked harder. Touching the collar with your hands will result in a shock as well, along with anyone else trying to fondle it's lock, it will still shock you.""

*Klopp screamed as the guards began to drag him away*

""THIS IS FUCKING KANGAROO COURT! YOU CAN'T DO THIS! YOU JAVE NO IDEA HWO BADLY THE FACILITY WILL FALL APART! YOU, ALL OF YOU, BIASED! BIIIIAAAAASSSSEEDDDD!!!!""


*Soon, the doors slam shut, as the members spoke amongst themselves once more, leaving the player characters either to follow Klopp to his cell, remain in the court, leave, or whatever else they felt like doing*"

I am an average student, I get a lot of A's but I struggle with some classes and have gotten D's. Overall I try to challenge myself by taking ap and honors classes, but I absolutely suck at them. My gpa right now is around a 3.3 which isn't good enough to get into most good schools where I live in california.

I am very interested in law, especially patent law, and I would love to get ahead by doing an internship. However I don't really know how I would do that, and I doubt I would be at the top of their list even if I got a chance.

-

I would just be very appreciative if someone could help me on some good ways to get ahead on a career, considering I probably can't get far on brains. Although I am really good at english, history, and debate, just not very good at math/science.

-

To conclude, I am a very depressed teen that doesn't know a thing about getting a career and making a decent living for myself. I honestly think about this so much and I worry that my future will turn out like many others. Lacking a job they enhjoy, money to enjoy, and of course happiness.

With the information that Ive acclamated over the past couple of weeks. I have made a conclusion.
Bart and Joe truelly state that they do indeed love making videos and that they are proud to admitt theat their adventures are just the beginning to somthing even bigger in a sense.


But over the years we see them creating at least another channel every 8 months to 2 years. Jkfilms,jknews,jkgaming,barbell brigade, ask the feels and maybe just maybe in the future with their clothing brand ""GoForBroke"" may have a channel.
They stated on jkfilms that they quit and that they want to broaden their horizon to other parts of film making and that they want to make a ""movie"" (which wont release in another 10 years trust me). Now on jkfilms they have sit down discussions talking about sexual themed topics. Which reacts the same notion of jknews but its not news.


Coming to jk gaming, the content is truly forced. Every three months they post a video because they know that it's decent cash making them at least $650 a month for the interns and main team joe and bart.



Barbell clothing is made by barts girl geo. Which has a channel making fitness videos. Now with clothing and making videos they easily make around $5000-10000 a month in revenue to help further their liquid captial growth.
Now I could go on about the other channels but you can clearly see the pattern. Now I know I missed some information or I may sound vague but you can kind of see what Im trying to point out.
CONCLUSION: Bart and Joe are cashing out to be blunt. Yes they remain true to their core ideas of making great content and staying ""real"" but at the end of the day. They live multiple lives portraying multiple aspects of their daily life and surround their life around cameras on the daily.
It's clear they need more youtube channels to survive but sooner or later once they fade their out to do somthing bette besides youtube and clothing. Bart and Joe have lost their since of purpose on youtube.
I feel bad for julia because she clearly came to jkfilms to help make videos but now all she does is making jknews videos and help behind the scenes with meetings or stupid medial work getting paid 70k a year from barts and geos clothing brand..
Its a plan they tend to keep and its a hell of mess bound to crash."

I was really disappointed because I really liked him and had thought maybe we could make it work, but it was clear he didn't want to put in the effort. I chalked it up to emotional incompatibility, maybe even another girl in the picture, and deleted his number but still kept him on Snapchat (I honestly forgot I had added him.) I finished my internship and moved back to my college town to finish up my degree.

Last month he started talking to me again out of the blue and told me he had missed me.

We just grabbed beers together and it was nice seeing him again. However, these past few days he has started to become more emotionally distant. Instead of texting me constantly throughout the day and talking on the phone at night, it's like pulling teeth to get him to text me back and he hasn't been returning my calls. I don't know what (if?) I did wrong and it feels just like it did last time. I know that right now we're just getting to know each other again and not putting pressure on the relationship to date, but I have feelings for him and I don't want to be just friends. I think it's becoming clearer and clearer that we're not compatible and I want to nip it in the bud before it even starts because I get attached very easily and don't want to cause myself any more heartache than I already have. Should I become distant myself or blatantly say that I think it's best for us to go our separate ways?
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: A guy that I used to date recently started talking to me again but I can feel him becoming emotionally distant from me, which is the exact same thing he did the last time we tried to date. I don't want to be just friends with him because I have romantic feelings for him. I'm wondering whether to blatant tell him it's not going to work out (even though we haven't explicitly said to one another that we want to try dating again) or just become more distant from him myself."

So my hair situation is pretty simple. I get relaxers and have been getting them since 2008 (when I was 13, which is a really late time to have started compared to others who started at 5). I have BSL to MBL hair. Lately, I tend to ""stretch"" my relaxer and let my kinky hair grow. I've been told this is a good thing because apparently when it's time for my next relaxer it will make my relaxed hair stronger, I suppose. 

Anyways, I'm currently 18 weeks post-relaxer as of tomorrow and I'm loving how much of my new growth has come in, plus I wouldn't be able to get a relaxer until possibly November when I come home from college for Thanksgiving or even December when I go home for the holidays. I even took a TINY section of hair and snipped off the relaxed ends with scissors just to see what it would look like if I BC'd the whole head. I spoke to a woman who is natural yesterday at an intern expo and she told me that if this is how much it can grow in this length of time, imagine how much I'll have in a year. In late 2012, I've attempted to transition (in an attempt to still keep in my long [BSL to MBL] hair that I've had since birth) to natural but since I had NO clue what I was doing at all to care for the two textures, I caved after SIX MONTHS. I've accumulated so much hair, though that my best friend (who is natural) said I should have just chopped it all off. It doesn't help that I'm tenderheaded as hell with my natural hair (I feel like I'm the only one).

If I tell my mom about my considering going natural (again), I feel like she will say what she always says: ""Look at all this hair that you have!!! Girls literally pay so much money to have hair like yours why would you want to cut it off?"" And in my head I'm like ""I know that but if you haven't noticed, my hair GROWS. It's clearly growing at a pretty quick pace, just look at how much new growth I've gotten."" I wouldn't even mind rocking short hair for a while because it's less maintenance, plus I have more options for hairstyles (with relaxed hair I feel limited kind of; I can't wear braids or twists , can only color my hair at the same time I get a relaxer , etc). 

**TL;DR** I'm 18 weeks post and have this sudden urge to just chop off the relaxed ends and start all over again, but I'm afraid to tell my mom or hairdresser or anybody about it plus I'm extremely tenderheaded and feel like I'll regret BCing because of it??? Not even sure if this is the right subreddit to post this in , I'm extremely conflicted on this issue; please help!!"

It's late October and Black Friday only a few weeks away, which means that I need to be making some Christmas shopping money. I'm just a college student about to graduate as a computer science major / math minor. In most situations, a guy like me would kinda have a *paying* job already, but I took the painful risk of taking an unpaid internship, so I'm a little broke.

That's why I'm offering this service! I can help you with any lower division computer science / math projects, homework, exams, etc. Keep in mind that **I don't really program in Java**, but since it's conceptually similar / not too far from C++ syntax-wise, I'd still be willing to help you in that too.

Anyway, I'll just reiterate what's in the title:

I'm willing to help you in any of the following fields:

1.   C++ Data Structures &amp; Object Oriented Programming
2. Objective-C : I can help you create a basic productivity app for the iPhone / iPad.
 * NOTE: I do not make games in iOS, only productivity apps
3. Discrete Math : Anything in introduction to discrete math
4. Lower Division Math / Upper Division Up To Calculus 3 &amp; Linear Algebra
5. GitHub : I can walk you through the basics of GitHub, start your repository, and get the ball rolling.
6. MIPS ASSEMBLY : A bit of a miscellaneous offer, but yeah. I know my way around lower-level languages. :) 

Keep in mind that I do also offer tutoring for any of these fields. By tutoring, I mean I'm willing to help you understand how to finish your assignment conceptually without spoonfeeding you the answer. I feel this way is the most rewarding way for you as a buyer, and it'll also help ME learn. But, I understand that sometimes you can be in a rush and you need an assignment complete ASAP. I'm also willing to *help* you do that.

Not entirely sure if this is the most ideal formatting for this type of post, but if anything, PM me and let me know what you need help with. My rates really depend on the assignment, and I do take Paypal, Bitcoin, Amazon Gift Card, or even Pete's Coffee giftcards (because a man needs his coffee).

If you need a link to my Github profile or any of my previous projects, PM me and I'll provide you with those as well. Also, as of right now, I'm unable to video-chat with any of you right now because my blue-yeti microphone just broke, so..yeah.

To introduce myself shortly, I am a young (24) aspiring First A.D. currently working I.T during the day and studying at night (like a lame Batman) in France in a cinema school (CLCF).

As for today, except the dozens of student films I have participated in, I don't have much experience of a real set (I plan on multiplying internships during the second part of the year as soon as I'll have enough money saved up).

My question concerns my future career, I would very much like to find work abroad (the main target being Canada) and not only in France even if I realize we possess one of the most flourishing environment to work with.
This choice is motivated by my past experience in the USA and Canada mostly.

I would like opinions from professionals such as yourselves.

Thank you very much !

Throwaway because my reddit nickname is too similar to my gaming nickname. English is not my first language so please be kind. Names have been changed to protect the guilty. **Wall of text incoming!!!**


**BackGround**


I am part of an extended friend group that formed itself around a common interest for a certain video game that plays in a 5 vs 5 format. The group has formed around 10 years ago, in the beginning it was online only, then the group gradually started becoming closer to the point where we go regularly on vacation together. Over time some people have been on an off and new people were added.


The dynamic of the group has been to form teams of 5 people depending on the skill and motivation of the players to play competitively, and the rest of the time people play with whoever they want like friends would. We usually run 2-3 teams at the same time, sorted by level. No bad blood between teams.
 

Apart from myself my current team consists of Kevin (26M), Anthony (24M), Leonard (34M) and Randy (30M). I have joined the group around 9 years ago. Kevin was already a member at the time and I've been playing with him regularly ever since, usually in the best team. Anthony is Kevin's brother, he was introduced to the group around 4 years ago. Leonard and Randy joined about 3 years ago, though they knew each other and had been very good buddies before joining. We have been forming a team ever since. The leadership has been granted to Anthony as he had the time and motivation to do it.


We try to play scrimmage games one evening per week, and another evening is blocked for league/tournament games when they are active. This rythmn was agreed to and suits everyone. I have a full time job 40-45h / week, Randy works 60-70 hours a week but is good enough at managing his time to make it work. Kevin is a PhD student but has completed all courses and was given a 1-year extension to write his research paper so he has a lot of free time and just writes his paper maybe 5 hours a week. Anthony is in an education program than alternates between part-time 2 month internship and very part time courses. Leonard is unemployed and does not seem to be actively seeking employment. It is a normal occurence to get off work relatively early and find them in-game for several hours in the afternoon.
 

Two years ago we were approached by a sponsor which made some to-good-to-be-true promises. The sponsorships contracts were shady as fuck, and I was adamant to not sign anything before the contracts became clean; in the end nothing was signed and we have broken contact long ago. However this sponsor was actually the employer of professional players on other games. And during the months when we were discussing with them, we were known as the official team for that sponsor for our game. Kevin and myself have much more competitive experience and the commitments required to become a pro or semi-pro player, and we did not really see the use of what the sponsor offered us as it was not helping in becoming better players. And honestly, none of us is anywhere close to have the skills of a pro player, there are hundreds of teams better than us and maybe ~50 teams tops in the world have the opportunity to become professional.


However the other 3 seemed to become more ambitious during that time but nobody was making real steps to improve both individually and as a team. We came into disagreement on the methods to improve and we kinda entered a phase where defeats were blamed on individuals instead of global play as a team. Communication was bad, and particularly from Kevin who is the kind to ignore the problem until it goes away. The amount of blame taken was inversely proportionate to the skill level. The hierarchy was defined, with Kevin and me being the better players, Leonard in the middle, and Anthony and Randy being weaker.


After we cut the sponsor the atmosphere became calm and mature again, we were having good times again and came back to a realistic level on our expectations in tournaments. Our main focuses are an offline tournament A over the course of a week-end and an online league B over the course of several months. We have attended A and B several times without major issues and with modest results. However what happened during our ""sponsored"" time was never forgotten.
 

When the latest season of B ended in April or May, Randy and Leonard took a long break from our game, and we agreed to hold team activities until September, where the new tournament plannings would be announced. All of us were fine with it, but later Kevin mentioned to me and his brother that he would rather stop or find another team than start playing again with 2 rusty teammates a few weeks before tournaments resume (this is relevant later).


**The Incident**


Between May and September, we were playing much more with the rest of our group again, including a guy called Yohan, and also with new acquaintances from outside the group, including a guy called Bart. At the time we were using a voice communications software called Teamspeak where you can setup servers that host VoIP channels. It was not unusual to switch between the Teamspeak server of our team and the server where the guys we played with would usually stay.


In the course of a few months it seems Anthony's skills vastly improved and he became on par with Leonard, but his ego increased even more. He started to criticize much more the other players even when they were able to identify their own mistakes, so I took the lead on telling him he was the pot calling the kettle black. It did not help the the game released a feature where players would be officially categorized in tiers, with Kevin and me being in the best tier and the others being in the second best. I did behave arrogantly with him to shut down his behaviour.
 

Leonard came back on early August, and in mid-August a large group of us went for a vacation that was really great. Only Randy was missing as he was already travelling abroad.


In early September Randy came back, but the organizers of A and B announced that the next editions would start somewhere in next February. So we gave ourselves more time to chill before resuming regular scrimmage.


During the next two weeks, when getting off work on my game days I would only find Yohan on our teamspeak while the others would be already playing with Bart and their lobby was full, so I think no big deal they must be on Bart's teamspeak server. Yet I ask Leonard and Anthony on which server they are and I get no answer. So I mainly played with Yohan. On one evening Randy is available to play and sets up the game party, and tells me to come to the Discord server (Discord is another VoIP program concurrent to Teamspeak). I tell him I have no idea what he's talking about and he sends Yohan and me the Discord configuration.


Turns out Anthony and Leonard suddenly decided to switch to Discord and managed to pass the info to everyone except Yohan and me.

 
During the next period of mid september to mid october, work gets busy and my planning changed as I gave time for other activities, so I played less but still played several times a week.


When connecting to Discord I would start to notice Kevin, Leonard, Anthony and Bart never saying Hi and never connecting to the voice channel where Yohan or I were staying if we connected first, they would just use another channel and create a lobby by themselves. This was something new.  For us this is literally the equivalent of planning a drink with everyone at a small pub where everyone can see every other table, find that Yohan and me are already at a table drinking beer, sneaking up to another table and hoping not to get noticed by us while we were busy with our drinks.


After a few days I finally manage to get a hold of Anthony and ask him if or when we would resume team games and that now that work was calmer I had better visibility on which days I was able to play and that it would fit with the planning of the rest of the team.
He answered that during a game with the 4 of them when I was not there, they were losing badly and the communication reached an all-time low, and Randy and Kevin got fed up and both said they didn't really want to play as a team anymore. So he would be looking for new teammates first and didn't know yet when we would resume. He then confirmed the planning with me. Leonard confirmed he was OK with the planning too and confirmed what Anthony said about Randy.
I tried to get Kevin's feedback on this but as usual he would dodge the question. Randy was not available on that day, but I made a mistake in not asking him his point of view in the next few days. I trusted the word of his buddy.


A few days later when I connect again there are new private channels on the server whose access is granted to Anthony, Kevin, Leonard, Bart, and Homer, Bart's friend. The dodging continues.


Which brings us to this Saturday. I connect and find Kevin, Anthony, Leonard, Bart and Homer in the middle of a scrimmage game on a public channel. I do not throw a huss and quietly listen. Homer and Bart are somewhat wannabees semi-pro casters/streamers so they have a small viewerbase on twitch and I connect to Homer's twitch. When, I said Hi anyways when I connected so they now know I spotted them.


On Sunday I try to contact Kevin first, I know he saw my messages but has been ignoring me for 2 days. Then I get a hold of Leonard, tell him that we live in a free country, people are free to play with whoever they want but they could have had the decency to tell me; especially after pretending I was still part of the team while Kevin would not be and making me arrange my schedule around the team. He said that the new team is really unofficial and nothing is confirmed, he has never heard of it being official now (particularly for tournaments A and B), that they are just playing 5-man party for fun and that I should ask Anthony for confirmation. If Anthony confirms then it would be news for both him and myself. He added that he understood I could be angry about the situation. Well bad luck, Homer has been annoucing on his stream that the team was official for A and B and they had high ambitions.


Then after a game of cat and mouse where he tried to avoid or change the topic, I finally confront Anthony and say the same things I told Leonard. The conversation basically goes like this (translated and simplified):
*Anthony* : Yeah it's something new we just started playing with them. Bart seemed to enjoy playing with us, he said he has a friend, Homer who may be interested, they proposed forming a team and we just accepted.
*Me* : And I guess it was really hard to warm the previous teammates, including the one who was still part of the plan? And what happened to your brother wanting to play again suddenly?
*Anthony* : Let's be honest, we weren't going to improve anymore with Randy in the team. And you haven't been around for a month. Leonard and Kevin were here in September.
*Me* : Now you're comparing a complete disappearance of several months with a reduce of my available time due to work. And for you ""not being there"" means being connected several times a week while you did your best to avoid me. Did you think all your dodging on Discord was not going to be noticed?
*Anthony* : Well yes I must admit we kinda went behind your back
*Me* : Okay then. I got it.


After that I was trying to sort out my feelings and thoughtlessly accepted Leonard and Anthony's invitation to a game. I was dead silent in this one. I was left with the impression they were sorry they got caught, not sorry they did it.


Yesterday I managed to speak to Randy and explained he never said he wanted to stop, but when he asked Anthony and Leonard what were the plans for our team, they answered that I was not motivated anymore and stopped playing. They then pretended tournaments A/B were not confirmed for this year and that it would be useless to make immediate plans for the team as they would still need to find another player first.


So they freed 2 slots by pretending to Randy and me the other one was out. Well done. Randy then showed a registration log of the new team for another tournament, which happened more than 3 weeks ago. It was held on the week after I first confirmed the new plans with Anthony and Leonard. Both of them lied even during the confrontation. Randy has been much smarter than me on this one.


**Now What?**


At this point I'm ready to cut my losses with Leonard and Anthony, though the silence of Kevin is the thing that upsets me the most here.
Part of me wants to get closure from him, but deep down I know he has not changed and he will either ignore or change the subject, or give vague answers. Should I bother?


I'm also also trying to wrap my head around the real reason of our replacement, was it for the improvement of the team (Bart and Homer come as a package deal, they are in the same skills bracket as Kevin and I so there is an improvement of overall skill and I'm collateral damage)? Or was because of the ego conflict with Anthony? Or perhaps they want to add morning/afternoon sessions and go in serious gaming mode (Bart and Homer also have a lot of free time during the day)?


Finally I still want to attend tournament A with another team, and it will be impossible to completely avoid contact with them there. What's the best course of action? Should I just ignore them? What's the most appropriate response to them when we see each other?
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: A friend and I have been kicked from our long-term gaming team, were never told about it and replaced behind our backs. The team told us both that the other one left voluntarily. They admitted to replacing us after confrontation and justified it by bullshit excuses that were still lies. 

Wondering if I should bother trying to get closure with the guy I was closest with in the team or just cut my losses. Also wondering what is the best courses of action when I meet the team again in a few months during an offline tournament."

I had good friends and a loving partner and people knew me at work and I was appreciated.

Now I have none of those safeguards. I'm alone in a new city on an internship and I live alone. It was getting worse before I moved here and then when I arrived the floor fell out from under me. I walked into the house I would be living in alone in the dark late on the night before starting my new job and just knew it would torment me.

Every few weeks I take another step down. It's trying to kill me. It's taken all the pleasure I find in talking to my friends, in working out, in doing anything. It's distracted me with my abusive now long distance partner while taking everything else and now the only hope I can bring myself to believe in is that my partner will start to treat me well again and we can be happy together but I know somewhere inside that will never happen and I hate myself for allowing myself to hate myself enough to ignore that.

I felt it before but I felt it _in_ my world. I never thought about suicide or let the thoughts about how terrible I and my future are reach me too deeply. Now it _is_ my world. There is no one to protect me from it. Before I thought I was strong because I had it but I could keep myself together and fight it. But now I see I wasn't strong, it was just weaker. It's so strong I feel helpless.

Today it started taking my ability to think. And I'm a software engineer so that makes me useless. My boss was telling me about some infrastructure change I needed to make and I listened but didn't understand a word and I KNOW I KNOW WHAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT. I need something drastic. I need something to intervene and stop it before I'm completely at its mercy.

I used to read posts on this subreddit all the time praying I never reached this point. For years I did, not understanding how vulnerable I was.

Then on my BDay my nmom texted (mid August): Happy brithday, [my name]. Hope you have a nice day! and her husband texted: Happy Birthday [nickname]! Give us a call so we can celebrate at least verbally, and let us know when we can celebrate in person. 

Then on 9/4 my nmom texted: I love you [my name]. Hope you know that.

Then on 9/10: Hi [my name], I'd like to take you out to dinner soon to hear how college is going.  I will text you next time I plan to be in the [city my college is in] area.  Hope you're doing well.  xo

Then on 10/4 she texted: Hi [my name]. We want to have a meetup with your speak via email text or phone. Though I think face to face would be best.

My nmom and her husband keep texting/emailing me random things and not apologizing. I really don't want to talk to them again and I even filed for a name change last week (I legally have her last name and my dad's last name) but they keep contacting me. My brother (still in high school and lives with them part-time) has been begging me to talk the my nmom and her husband. I know that they holidays are coming up but I really don't want to get involved with them again. My life is so much better without them. I'm doing well in college, I have two paid internships, I'm pursuing my passions, and I just feel healthier and happier. 

Any advice?

59erpw,5,2016-10-25,Advice - IT Professional seeking work with drug-related felony conviction,ITJess,MNJobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/MNJobs/comments/59erpw/advice_it_professional_seeking_work_with/,"I'm looking on advice on how to find a job with a criminal record.  I am 24 years old and have worked in professional positions full-time for 7 years.  I started my Associate degree full-time my junior year of high school while working in administrative and telemarketing, then worked for a couple years as an IT Intern and Business Systems Analyst, then for almost four years at my last full-time job working as an IT Data Analyst I-III working with databases.

&amp;nbsp;

Details on Conviction:  I have a felony conviction on  my record for heroin delivery; I got in with the wrong crowd when I was 19 and committed the crime.  Charges were filed by the state almost a year later and I was convicted in March 2012.  Since the crime took place I have successfully completed a Mental Health &amp; Substance Abuse treatment program and have not had any issues since.

&amp;nbsp;

Where I'm at:  I loved my last job but they ended up laying off our department mid-2015 due to some internal and infrastructure changes.  I worked there for almost four years and when I was laid off it was the first time I've ever had to look for work with a criminal background.  Since I was laid off I've been doing some freelancing, but not enough to support myself on.  I also nannied for my sister for nine months after my nephew (2) started having complications from Lyme disease.  I normally never have an issue finding a position, but I feel like I have to change my approach after having numerous successfull interviews and then having my offer pulled due to background check results.  I'm just so frustrated!  I've tried looking online for companies hiring felons but they are all retail, warehouse, and fast food type work.  I don't want to have to settle working in some gas station or subway when I know I'm good at what I do and enjoy it.  I know I'll have to adjust my life now that I have a conviction, but I feel like there must be a position out there for me somewhere with employers that are willing to look past it.

&amp;nbsp;

Has anybody else had experience with Minnesota or Telecommute jobs (from hiring or searching side) with a conviction or felony to consider?  Are there any employers who are known to be more flexible with drug-related crimes?  Any help or advice will be appreciated.  I just don't know where else to turn to and I feel like all I'm doing these days is climbing uphill.  Thanks!"

My current GPA is a 3.0; got a 2.7 in intermediate accounting 1 and a 2.1 in intermediate accounting 2. The 3rd intermediate accounting I faired better getting a 3.1. My non accounting classes all hover around the 3.0(out of 4.0). 

I applied to 8 internships and didn't get a single call back.  All my friends got offers to the big four accounting firms, but here I am not even getting a single offer from any of the places I applied to. It's hard not to be jealous when they talk about their internship offer. 

I don't understand how people can look past their failures. Everyday I feel bummed out knowing I didn't get a job offer from the big four or any of the other firms I applied to. I'm starting to get stressed out. Time after time I fail. I fail to get good grades. I fail to get an internship for the summer. Fail to stay motivated to workout. Failure is all I know and have know for my whole life.

**Other discoveries of Hillary’s hypocrisy**

o	Already evident in the links above – Hillary has gotten donations from foreign countries that kill and enslave woman and gays – yet she rips on republicans for supposedly being sexist and homophobic – SHE HAS ALSO SAID SHE IS AGAINST GAY MARRIAGE IN THE PAST – JUST SHOWS THAT SHE ONLY SAYS WHAT IS POPULAR

o	Hillary’s 2008 campaign is the one who started the whole “Obama isn’t from America” stuff, and now she insults Trump for saying he’s not from America – she also started a very racist picture of him in a garb
o	http://www.thepoliticalinsider.com/7-news-stories-2008-prove-hillary-started-obama-birtherism/ 
o	http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/aug/22/fact-checking-media-yes-clinton-machine-did-start-/ 
o	Remember that she admires a KKK member too! 


In conclusion, yes, I know Trump may say mean things that hurt some people’s fragile feelings, and that he talks just like every other guy in the world, and he wants to deport those innocent ILLEGAL immigrants. But Hillary Clinton and the DNC have ALL of this under their belt. This is massive corruption, highly illegal, and covered up very well. The media will not talk about this as much as it needs to be talked about, and maybe not even at all because they have ties with Hillary and the DNC. Hillary is a total liar, and she does not care about you, minorities, Catholics, Muslims, or this country – all very clearly evident in this document. She will also try to steal your vote, so watch out on November 8th for “glitches” in the voting machines – or better yet, ask for a paper ballot. This is a turning point in the country – one that’s so important that if turned the wrong way, we will be living in a full-on dystopia. Good luck America.

59fahz,2,2016-10-25,Grant Thornton vs Big 4,GTornah,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/59fahz/grant_thornton_vs_big_4/,"I'm looking for some advice or confirmation that I'm not making a bad decision on choosing GT over a big 4 for an internship.

My basic story is, I'm recruiting currently for an audit internship. I see myself wanting to stay in public accounting for a while and when I do leave I think I'd want to do something different, maybe something entrepreneurial or non-profit or going back to grad school for something else (i.e. not trying to jump ship to the business world after a few years in public). I have offers from 2 Big fours and I just had my GT interview yesterday which felt like it went very well. I'm trying to decide now which firm's offer I should take, if I am offered one from GT.

I really like all the people I've met from GT, I've made good connections and felt like I'd fit well with them. It also seems like I'd have a wider range of clients/industries/tasks there than I would at B4, and the work-life balance I'm told is better (glassdoor reviews say this too). I see myself there and my gut is saying GT. 

At the same time, I have offers from B4, and I feel like I *should* take one of them instead because it's the big 4 and that is what public is all about, even though I'm not as excited about the firms. Any advice?"

Grades-wise, I've got around a 3.4 GPA in a Computer Science major, which I think is solid. However, this semester in terms of grades has been a rollercoaster, and trying to juggle all of my new activities with classes that I'm not enjoying all that much. I am so incredibly afraid of my GPA dropping because at times I feel like it's all I really have to be proud of or show off as an accomplishment, and even a 3.4 is not that fantastic. I got all As and A-s with some difficult classes in my previous semester, which made me happy, but the fear of not accomplishing the same thing this semester is driving me crazy. I had a bad couple of tests earlier this semester, and some turned out bad due to just too many things going on and me feeling overwhelmed, but I don't feel like this is an excuse. I am so tied to the idea that your grades are a reflection of your self-worth and intelligence, and while I know this isn't true, it is also a reflection of how much of a lazy bastard I can be.

I'm working as a course assistant for a computer science ethics course, and while the benefits of leadership and management  experience are valuable to have on a resume, as well as having access to reference letters from my professor for this course, I hate doing it so much. It's such needless and overly specific work, and while I don't regret doing it and having the special invitation from my professor to do so, it still takes up so much time.

I also working on the student government for an orchestra club on campus where we compose and perform our own music. I wanted to compose this semester, but our deadline is coming soon and I have next to nothing. While I have been busy, my own laziness has gotten in the way. I also feel like I'm just a shitty musician. I play bass, and I feel so incompetent compared to other members of the orchestra, despite the casual environment we strive for.

Yesterday, I had my first technical interview with a company. I was not expecting the interview to be a technical interview, and all information I received about the interview pointed to it being a behavioral interview, which I have done very well on before. I practically pissed all over myself and could barely answer any of their questions, I felt so embarrassed. Then it got me thinking that I know so little about what I'm studying and haven't applied myself in outside projects as much as my peers. I feel like I'll be incompetent at any internship or job I will do and that I'm in the wrong profession and have wasted my time, even if I do enjoy the subject.

My personal life has also been in flux, as despite helping run the orchestra club I'm in, not many people in the club go out of their way to talk to me and try to become friends with me. I can be quiet and reserved, but I try my best to come off as friendly and helpful. I still have my friends in my apartment building to hang out with(many of whom I've known since grade school), as well as my dorm-mates from last year, but since I spend a lot of my time with them, it's torturous to spend time with these people and barely have any conversation occur between us.

My ex-girlfriend goes to the same college as me, and we broke up a little over a year ago, and how I feel about it can be a struggle. When things go bad for me, I often think about how she might be having a better time than I am, which makes me feel worse. I hate who she is, since she hit me  multiple times and basically stopped giving a shit about us in the last few months of our relationship, and it's annoying to see her be treated well despite me knowing what she's truly like. She has also had sex with another guy, who was desperate to be with her even when the two of us were still together, while I've been with no one since we broke up. I wish that I didn't know this and that it didn't eat at me as much as it does. I generally feel romantically lonely, and my efforts to get myself more out there and be more generally attractive have been met with zero results, but I could still be doing things better probably. 

I know all of this doesn't sound too bad, but I'm just so stressed most of the time, and everything compounds in on itself. I have thought of suicide multiple times throughout this semester, more in the past month than any other point in my life combined. I am afraid of failure, I'm afraid of being alone, and I'm afraid of not achieving what I want to in life. I should suck it up, stop beign a bitch, and actually put the effort forward, but as soon as things starting going well a little bit again I grow content with the current situation, grow lazy again, and let myself down again.

I have slept with a knife next to my bed for over a month now, and have thought of buying a gun, even though I have no idea where I would get one around here. I have also forgotten to eat a lot of the time. I don't want to end my life because I care more about other people than I do myself. I don't want them to go through the grief of losing me. But if I was truly alone in this world, I would probably end my life tonight.

 I have sought help from my closest friends, and while they have been of help, it falls on me to ultimately make myself better, but I just keep failing, slowly, but surely. It's almost as if I'm too busy to kill myself. I don't have the courage to tell my parents this, it would break their hearts. Instead, all I can talk about is my worsening situation and chalk it up to me making dumb mistakes.

I do feel genuinely happy often, but it's a revolving door, and every time I step back into depression it gets worse. I'm just going to keep going on like this, and maybe end it later on if things just keep getting worse.

Thanks for reading if you did."

59ftgt,1,2016-10-26,Roger Cohen of the New York Times declares that anti-Zionism is anti-Semitism,ShaunaDorothy,leftwinger,https://www.reddit.com/r/leftwinger/comments/59ftgt/roger_cohen_of_the_new_york_times_declares_that/," By Chris Marsden
24 October 2016

On October 18, Roger Cohen published a column in the New York Times titled “Anti-Semitic Anti-Zionism.”

The column targets UK Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn and compares him negatively to Donald Trump. Its broader purpose, however, is made clear in the very first line: “The hard left meeting the hard right is an old political story, as Hitler understood in calling his party the National Socialists.”

Cohen’s “old political story” is an old political lie. Nazism was developed not primarily as an anti-Semitic, but as an anti-communist movement. Anti-Marxism and opposition to the international unification of the working class was Hitler’s driving obsession, to which he counterposed ethnic German nationalism. His hatred of the Jews was based upon their association with the socialist movement.

He stated in Mein Kampf that his aim was to destroy “Jewish Bolshevism.” He wrote of his “conviction” that “the question of the future of the German nation is the question of the destruction of Marxism... In Russian Bolshevism we must see the attempt undertaken by the Jews in the twentieth century to achieve world domination.”

The service provided to German imperialism by “National Socialism,” i.e., fascism, was to mobilise the ruined petty-bourgeoisie and the declassed lumpen-proletariat as a shock force against the organised workers’ movement. Its essential political aim was to eradicate Marxian socialism and destroy the labour movement as a precondition for the unleashing of militarism and war, which were necessary to secure the markets and territory required by German imperialism, as expressed in Hitler’s goal of “Lebensraum.”

Cohen regurgitates the old anti-communist slander—identifying the “hard” left with the “hard” right—to underscore his assertion that the “leftist supporters of Britain’s Labour Party,” described by him as an alliance of “young dreamers and old guard Leninists,” are aligned with Trump. Corbyn’s supporters, he declares, “like Vladimir Putin’s Russia even as he flattens Aleppo... oppose or are skeptical of NATO, the cornerstone of the Western alliance,” and “see a conspiracy of what Trump has called ‘global financial powers.’”

In regard to the supposed espousal of anti-Semitism by the “Corbynistas,” the main theme of his confused rambling, Cohen declares them to be even worse than Trump! The Republican presidential candidate is only opportunistically using “tropes with a distinctly anti-Semitic undertow about the banks and financiers plotting the ‘destruction of US sovereignty,’” but “these are words, not a program.”

“He’s a New Yorker after all,” Cohen adds shamelessly.

In contrast, “Corbyn and his extreme left backers” are the advocates of what “the British political theorist Alan Johnson has called ‘anti-Semitic anti-Zionism.’” As proof, Cohen cites a cross-party parliamentary committee that concluded Corbyn had created a “safe space” for “those with vile attitudes towards Jewish people,” and declared that Labour’s “passivity before anti-Semitic incidents” risked “lending force to allegations that elements of the Labour movement are institutionally anti-Semitic.”

This is the second foray by Cohen on the issue, following a March 7 column titled “An Anti-Semitism of the Left.” But his slanders are reinforced by a number of other Times articles, including one by Dave Rich titled “Anti-Semitism and the British Left” and another by Kenan Malik of the libertarian Institute of Ideas, publishers of Spiked Online, which bears the headline “The British Left’s ‘Jewish Problem.’”
A concerted slander campaign

All such claims are a calumny against hundreds of thousands of progressive and anti-racist working people and students who have rallied behind Corbyn. In this, the New York Times has taken its place in an alliance of the Conservative Party, right-wing sections of the Labour Party and numerous Zionist groups. These forces are collaborating in a political campaign that has two aims: to discredit Corbyn in order to place the Labour Party under the firm control of its pro-NATO, pro-business right wing, and, of equal significance, to outlaw all criticism of the state of Israel and Zionism as a form of anti-Semitism. As the Socialist Equality Party warned in April:

“A political amalgam has been established that equates any criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism, with the aim of charging the entire ‘left’ with this crime—on the basis that all Jews identify with the state of Israel. Any criticism of the historical actions of the Zionist movement, and, above all, any equation of Israel’s brutal treatment of Palestinians with that suffered by Jews under fascism, is outlawed.”

The “discovery” of Labour’s supposed anti-Semitism was made only after Corbyn was first elected as party leader in September 2015. Fearing the underlying oppositional sentiment expressed in the support for Corbyn, the party’s right wing and the media went on a political offensive—including accusing Corbyn himself of being an anti-Semite due to his opposition to Israel’s brutal treatment of the Palestinians and his advocacy of a negotiated settlement in the Middle East involving Hamas and Hezbollah.

For the most part, this pattern has been repeated ever since. On April 27, for example, Naz Shah, Labour MP for Bradford West, was suspended from the party for the “crime” of retweeting a map of Israel superimposed on a map of the US so as to depict Israel as one of the US states. This image had been republished from the web site of leading historian Professor Norman Finkelstein.

One day later, Ken Livingstone, the former London mayor, who has been active in left-wing and radical causes for more than 40 years, was suspended from the Labour Party for defending Shah and stating on BBC radio, “Let’s remember, when Hitler won his election in 1932 [sic], his policy then was that Jews should be moved to Israel. He was supporting Zionism. [He then] went mad and ending up killing 6 million Jews.”

As the World Socialist Web Site explained, “[T]he worst that can be said about Livingstone’s comments is that he spoke with insufficient care. The statement that Hitler supported Zionism, without further qualification, is imprecise and challengeable on factual grounds. Hitler was a virulent anti-Semite, and whatever support he and his regime gave to Zionism was steeped in the most cynical political calculations and always subordinate to the Nazi leader’s unwavering and pathological hatred of Jews. However, it is a matter of historical record that after Hitler came to power in 1933, significant sections of the Zionist movement in Germany sought an accommodation with the regime.”

Other Labour suspensions followed, almost all related to posts made during Israel’s 2014 war on Gaza, during which Israel’s indiscriminate bombing led to the deaths of 1,462 civilians, including 551 children, out of a total death toll of 2,251 Palestinians. No mention of these crimes was made in the media outrage that followed, much of it based upon sometimes falsified material dredged up by the Conservative Party blogger Guido Fawkes.

During the latest leadership contest, which Corbyn again won, Labour’s sinister Compliance Unit trawled through the accounts of tens of thousands of party members. But all of this has led only to between 20 and 40 suspensions out of a party membership of half a million. The majority of these suspensions were related to criticisms of Israeli policy towards the Palestinians and statements opposing Zionism.
The anti-communist pedigree of Alan Johnson

Cohen cites approvingly Alan Johnson’s term “Anti-Semitic Anti-Zionism.” What he does not explain is that Johnson writes in his capacity as senior research fellow at the Britain Israel Communications and Research Centre (BICOM), run by Poju Zabludowicz, a billionaire who also funds Conservative Friends of Israel.

BICOM is one of a number of Zionist organisations which, working with the Tories and the Blairite wing of the Labour Party, have been central to the campaign to portray Labour as a bedrock of “left anti-Semitism.” Cohen’s earlier March 7 article, for example, relates to the resignation of the co-chair of the Oxford University Labour Club, Alex Chalmers, who claimed his fellow members were anti-Semitic. Chalmers is a former intern with BICOM and resigned over the decision of the Labour Club to support Oxford’s Israel Apartheid Week.

Another key organisation is the equally well-funded Community Security Trust (CST), in which Dave Rich is a key figure. Rich is the author of the book The Left’s Jewish Problem: Jeremy Corbyn, Israel and Antisemitism. The book is published by Biteback, part-owned by Political Holdings Ltd, which is run by billionaire former Tory Party Deputy Chairman Michael Ashcroft.

Johnson’s pro-Zionist sympathies were incubated during his years as a member of the anti-Trotskyist Alliance for Workers Liberty. He went on to become a leading advocate of imperialist military intervention as co-author of the 2006 Euston Manifesto. The manifesto argued in favour of the Iraq war and occupation on the basis that socialists should align themselves with the “democratic” mission of the Western powers in combating Islamic fundamentalism and not espouse “a blanket and simplistic ‘anti-imperialism.’” It urged opposition to concealed “prejudice against the Jewish people behind the formula of anti-Zionism.” Johnson praises the “social democratic anti-totalitarianism” of Tony Blair, as well as the “democracy-promotion” of the US neo-cons.

In an article for the BICOM-linked journal Fathom, “The Left and the Jews: Time for a Rethink,” Johnson denounces a “strand of distinctively left-wing hostility to Jews” that “takes the form of a wild, demented, unhinged form of anti-Zionism.” He proclaims the guilty to be all those who claim that Zionism is racist and/or engage in what he terms “Holocaust inversion,” i.e., any comparison between Israel and Nazi Germany—“even in the language of intellectuals.” His list of intellectuals “unhinged” by their anti-Zionism includes the historian Ilan Pappe, Professor Noam Chomsky, the poet Yitzhak Laor and sociologist Yehuda Shenhav.

Johnson decries the idea that the Jews could ever assimilate into European society and targets Lenin in particular for having set up “the ‘Good Jew/Bad Jew’ dichotomy” as part of his advocacy of assimilation. “The Left hoped to dissolve Jewish peoplehood in the solvent of progressive universalism,” he charges. But Nazism and the Holocaust left such ideals “in tatters,” so that today, anti-Zionism can mean only “a programme of comprehensive hostility to all but a sliver of world Jewry, a programme for the eradication of actually existing Jewish self-determination.”

This insistence that Zionism is the legitimate and unchallengeable voice of the Jewish people is the broader political agenda behind the slanders directed against Corbyn and his supporters in the Labour Party. It means that any and all criticism or opposition to the state of Israel—“actually existing Jewish self-determination”—can be denounced as an example of disguised anti-Semitism.
The House of Commons Select Committee redefines anti-Semitism

Cohen dismisses as a “whitewash” the report commissioned by Corbyn and authored by Shami Chakrabarti, the former head of human rights group Liberty, which rejects claims of rampant anti-Semitism in the Labour Party.

Without citation of evidence or any independent examination, he instead declares his solidarity with an October 15 House of Commons Home Affairs Committee report into anti-Semitism, which is a hatchet job produced exclusively for factional purposes by Corbyn’s opponents. The report was published by a committee consisting of five Conservative MPs, one member of the Scottish National Party and two leading Labour opponents of Corbyn, Chuka Umunna and David Winnick.

In a perfunctory introduction, the report admits that the vast majority of hate crimes are directed against Muslims, the incidence of which rose by 326 percent last year. Anti-Semitic crimes that year totalled 1.4 percent of all hate crimes, of which 41 were violent incidents—a 13 percent fall. Most crimes are on social media and the report acknowledges that “CST figures suggest that around three-quarters of all politically motivated anti-Semitic incidents come from far-right sources.”

Having made these points, the committee gets down to its real agenda of targeting the Labour “left”—faithfully reproducing every slander against Corbyn’s supporters and always with the intention of conflating anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism.

The main criticism made of the Chakrabarti inquiry is that it “declined to provide a definition of anti-Semitism.” The committee proposes to remedy this error by adopting the “working definition” of anti-Semitism adopted in June by the intergovernmental body, International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA).

This, it asserts, was drawn from an earlier “working definition” used by the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC), an agency of the European Union that has been replaced by the Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA). However, Blanca Tapia of the FRA has said the document published for a period on the EUMC web site was never regarded as a valid definition and it has been pulled offline “together with other non-official documents.”

The IHRA definition is significant for including as examples of anti-Semitism:

* Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a state of Israel is a racist endeavour.

* Applying double standards by requiring of it behaviour not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation.

* Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis.

These same criteria should now be adopted by the UK government, according to the Home Affairs Select Committee.

The definition also declares, in giving examples of anti-Semitism: “Manifestations might include the targeting of the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity,” and “Accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel, or to the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide, than to the interests of their own nations.” Yet the formula now being advanced—that Zionism is integral to the Jewish faith, which is inseparable from the state of Israel—plays directly into racist tropes, long the staple of fascist propaganda.

The implications of the proposed definition are so nakedly reactionary that the committee is forced to add two caveats that are supposed “to ensure that freedom of speech is maintained in the context of discourse about Israel and Palestine:”

* It is not anti-Semitic to criticise the government of Israel, without additional evidence to suggest anti-Semitic intent.

* It is not anti-Semitic to hold the Israeli government to the same standards as other liberal democracies, or to take a particular interest in the Israeli government’s policies or actions, without additional evidence to suggest anti-Semitic intent.

This is purely for the record. The caveats are there only because the definition to be adopted is inherently an attack on free speech. Indeed, the Community Security Trust is effusive in its praise for the report. In the BICOM-linked Jewish News, Dave Rich declares it to be “the new template for the fight against anti-Semitism,” because it not only justifies the ongoing purge within the Labour Party, but also potentially criminalises—as hate speech—criticism of the Israeli government. This is also what recommends the report to Cohen.

59hxow,0,2016-10-26,I'm [29/M] trying to help my GF of 3 years [22/F] with her over-controlling mother.,Artifex_Nox,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/59hxow/im_29m_trying_to_help_my_gf_of_3_years_22f_with/,"Hey guys, wish I didn't have to come here for this, but I don't know where else to go. I've been dating my girlfriend for 3ish years and her mother has gotten increasingly controlling and manipulative.  

Her mother was a school teacher, and has recently retired which I believe is leading her to being more controlling at home.  Her father has also recently retired from his job, but also from doing anything at all, such as helping his daughter lift heavy things, fix stuff around her room. I do help her with this stuff myself but as mom is controlling, I am not welcome around often.  


Dad is nice enough, but a total push over, will not stand up against mom or stick up for daughter in almost any situation. For example, dad has a secret train hobby that he hides from mom, because she will complain about the clutter or something. Mom does not shop, cook or clean, and relies on my GF to do household duties.


Parking in my area is tough, and my girlfriend once got a parking ticket. My girlfriend is very prompt when it comes to paying bills and stuff, and she paid it right away, but didn't tell mom because she gets crazy. Well she found out anyway, and got crazy. She banned her from using the car and seeing me for 2 weeks, and made my gf pay an additional $100 to her. She used the hundred to go out to dinner and rubbed it in my girlfriend's face, while lecturing her on her irresponsibility, and how her parking habits are an indicator of her poor womanhood.  


Let me just say I have dated some girls who really are irresponsible and don't have their s*** together, but my girlfriend is one of the most organized, driven, and dependent girls I've ever dated. At her job, she has risen from intern to a do-it-all teacher/ secretary/ and now handles accounting and payroll because her manager knows she is a serious and dedicated to her job. Whenever I go to her job, her boss showers her with praise. He would pay her more if he could. 


I invited her to my sister's destination wedding. She has been working later hours at work to help pay for it, and to pay her mother back. She had to stay later than expected and missed her Tuesday night bathroom cleaning duty, to which Mom was outraged, wouldn't talk to her, and made her pay an additional $100. She has also been calling her fat, and insisting she loose weight for the wedding. She keeps pulling her dress out, and telling her, ""I really think you need to return this for something that fits."" My girlfriend is gorgeous and definitely does *not* have a weight problem.  


Her older brother lives in NJ, and was visiting recently. My GF was talking to him in private about these recent events, which mom must have caught wind of because she interrupted the conversation saying ""Joe, I really think you have to get going now."" Brother isn't a lot of help, anyway, he is more the type to ""tattle-tale"" to mom. Mom has also been feeding her lies about the brother in order to further drive them apart.  


My girlfriend is lost. She is a hard worker, she is struggling to get on her feet and be fully-independent but mom is making it harder to do so. My girlfriend's college graduation gift from her parents was money to buy a car. Before she made the purchase, mom flipped out, revoked the money and only allows her to use her old car, now, which she can hang over her head and give and take to her as she wishes. My girlfriend can afford her own car, but mom has threatened to kick her out. Or she can afford rent, in which case mom will revoke the car.  


I really don't know what to do. I did not grow up in an environment like this. I am not in the situation where she can live with me, but she stays with me a lot. I can't protect her from her own family 24/7. I have some choice words I'd love to tell mom, but I don't think thats an effective solution. What can I do?  

**TL;DR** Mom uses money, car privileges, and insults to control and manipulate 22 year old daughter."

I seek permanent entry-level positions in software development OR mid-level positions in QA, though I'd prefer the former. **I'm eager for anything with high expectations and the skills in cloud and mobile development.**

My career started as an internship in front-end design, then moved to QA because my first companies had more opportunities to interact with the full technology stack in QA than most dev teams.

I wrote several internal tools with this ""full stack."" Functions included cleaning up NSFW images from our Cloudinary share, measuring CDN data use relative to our contract limits, and a CLI script for comparing staging versus QA databases. I didn't know how to do any of these until I did them. I miss that.

After a layoff, I'm in another company contributing to a large suite of regression tests in Selenium and performing on-demand manual sanity/functional testing for new features in a team. **I've been trying to learn ""after hours"" for the past 14 months**, but that doesn't supplant professional work experience with mobile or cloud. Cloud and mobile are ""THE FUTURE"" for many reasons, and Seattle is a land of opportunity. I also have family in the area.

**SKILLS**

* Languages - PHP, C#, JavaScript, JQuery, Python, HTML5, CSS3

* Frameworks - Selenium, CasperJS. Some Mocha/Chai.

* CI - Jenkins, TravisCI

* Databases - MySQL, SQL. Learning MongoDB.

* Servers - LAMP, XAMPP, Node with Express, REST Services. Some experience with Redis (or at least turning it on and off again)

* In Progress - Completing JMeter/BlazeMeter course. Preparing for AWS SysOps certification.

I've only ever worked in AGILE environments, though sometimes things lean closer to Waterfall.

Aight centipedes, for those of you stuck at work/class/MAGA'ing/dicking hot bimbos, here is the cliffsnotes, this was originally a post in a thread but someone suggested it would be helpful if it was its own post. Roughly, this is what goes on in the video:

-O'Keefe reveals his methods to get all this spicy stuff, a number of Veritas reporters posed as wealthy donors/relatives of wealthy donors/volunteers, etc.

-This led to clear pay to play evidence where a price tag of some 450k was discussed, Creamer mentions that for the right price, meetings with Hillary and Obama are possible, as well as that he is well connected in the White House.

-Veritas wires 20 k to look legit. To do this, Veritas set up a secret bank account/shell company incorporated in fucking Belize, which wired the money to AUFC. Since the company and account are not American, and there is nothing confirming that the donor is American either, this leds credence to AUFC taking money from foreign actors. A Veritas investigator builds on this when he introduces another wealthy donor, and remarks that ""she is American"", to which Creamer replies that he assumed she was, though he shouldn't have. Creamer confirms he received the money.

-Internship is received by donor's pretend niece as a direct result of this donation.

-Creamer confirms that he is in contact with the campaign every day and that the campaign directs AUFC activities, which is, well, illegal.

-Creamer also seems to know about the women going public with Trumps accusations before they come out, though this is not delved upon.

-In exchange for more donations, Creamer sets up a powerful lawyer to help a pretend Syrian become American.

-When Veritas started to come out, the money was returned to Veritas as it may be an ""illegal overseas donation"". This wasn't a problem before the vids came out.

-Creamer also mentions that he is in constant contact with the White House, and the fact that he has been there some 350 times, and met with Obama a whole bunch is also mentioned. This might implicate the White House in all of this.

-I didn't make it clear whose bank account it was that was in Belize, it was Veritas, this makes Creamer taking the money shady as fuck as it is literally an offshore campaign contribution.  



That's about it, lmk if I missed something and I'll edit/add.

TLDR: Hillary campaign runs AUFC in violation of FEC laws, AUFC takes money from offshore accounts from possible non American actors, Bob Creamer sells access Clinton and Obama, and other govt related things for donations, RE: Pay for play, or more accurately, Bribery.

We take a realistic approach to each park and take their demo and budget into consideration. 

I figured I'd start this subreddit to allow us and other coaster fans out there to discuss and debate theme park expansions over the years.

As an episode is released, there will be a topic created where we can discuss the show and more importantly, the park in topic.

I'm 23 I've been going to school for audio engineering and IT but the IT world has really turned me against it and I really don't want that to be my future.

First off people who have actually been able to make it their ""9-5"" when did you feel like you could completely switch over? Are you a home based studio or did you actually somehow find a job at an established studio? Is there anything you can tell me that you wished you knew at my age?

So here's the situation.. I'm going to graduate after next semester and I really don't want to go into the IT field. I would much rather get my own little house and set it up to be a full studio but I have no idea how to go about this. Would a bank somehow be able to help me? Would I just need to save up with a 9-5 until I can afford something? Should it be a house or should I be looking for a more commercial spot that I would have to completely redo?  Is this dream just going to crash and burn?

I've tried internships but they all come back dead. The only place that technically takes interns is Chapman's recording studio in Kansas but they have about a 9 month waiting period and a buddy from class said all you really get to do is play with a few cool toys but they would never actually consider hiring you.

This really is more of the business side and I didn't know whether to put it here or r/personalfinance but I just wanted to know if it's even possible for me to get a place to call my own and build a studio.

So, if this isn't allowed, I respect if it gets removed. With that being said, I am looking for some great writers to add to our website and know this is a great place to find them.

I currently write for a website called ""Armchair All-Americans"" and we consist of ordinary people with extremely hot takes writing about what we love most: sports.

I am recruiting for Capitals hockey and we are looking to expand. If you love the Caps and think you could write about them (previews/recaps/analysis) on a consistent basis, please DM me!

We are closing the gap between the sheer size and dominance of sites like SBNation and Scout. If you always wanted to write for those sites, Armchair is a perfect avenue for you to not only write but create a path for yourself in the sports journalism industry. We provide you the resources and structure, so all you need to do is write!

If you are a college student, we qualify as a college credit or sports media internship.

Thanks!"

Last summer I did an internship at the Aerospace Corporation doing signal processing work investigating frequency estimation algorithms and I really enjoyed the work. I've decided I want to pursue this type of work and see what type of jobs are available for new graduates. I go to a top 20 university and do well in my classes and overall think I have a strong resume, I just need help finding where to apply.

Does anyone have advice for finding companies that would hire new grads to do DSP type work? Any specific companies I should look at or just browse job boards? Any help would be appreciated."

And because this is the **Election Edition** we should compare the candidates:

Hillary Clinton [-50]

Donald Trump [+12]

Interestingly enough Joseph Stalin matched Trump's 12, but it's safe to say where our sub stands with dictators as we saw with the last Power Rankings holding Adolf Hitler at a comfy 76.

I don't have a twitter but i think it'd be good to show the boys where we stand with them, whether we think they read this sub or not it'd be a good pat on the back to them, not to shit-stir. No. Only as a congratulations. No shit-stirring please.

Looking for (4) powered single 18s, preferably ETX-18SPs or JBP SRX818SPs, and (2) powered 12inch tops, again preferably EV or JBL.

Anyone have this gear available for rental? Or know of a place that does? QSC and other equivalent brands are also prospects.

It's an 80x60x15ft room. Just trying to cover the dancefloor.

Gig is November 4th (I think).

He should be able to pick up the equipment, but delivery is always nice.

He's also looking to rent a Native Instruments Kontrol S4 out there so we don't have to ship it.

59lu43,4,2016-10-26,The Executrix and Her Intern [Str8][Fm][oral][insertion],JulianDelacourt,sexystories,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexystories/comments/59lu43/the_executrix_and_her_intern_str8fmoralinsertion/,"As the phones rang outside her office, Charla Fox sat behind her desk texting away on her phone.


The young executive texted, ‘Are we still on for tonight?’


He answered, ‘Yes.’


‘Can you get kinky?’


‘How kinky?’


‘Ben Wa balls.’


Charla waited and waited for his response. He was probably using a search engine to find out what Ben Wa balls are. 


Finally, his response. ‘In you, right?’


'Of course.’


‘I can accommodate that.’


Thomas Keller was a good looking man with strong looking hands and a great smile under his hipster beard. At least that how he looked on his profile picture.


“Ms. Fox?”


Charla looked up to see her summer intern Jason Graham standing at the door. A twenty three year old kid with charming good looks, the senior from Columbia had been her gopher all summer in her investment banking department. He stepped in with a three inch thick manila envelope.


“The contracts from Wassermans are here,” he said, setting the envelope down on her desk.


“Good. Thanks. Have a seat. I want to talk to you,” she said, setting down her phone.


He sat looking a bit anxious and confused. He should. She was wearing her power suit for her breakfast meeting she had this morning with executives in from the firm’s west coast office. And though her jacket hung on the coat rack and her blouse was delicate and lady like, she still had the aura of a boss with her keen deep blue eyes set in an alabaster face framed with lush dark hair. Jason took a seat across from her.


Charla said, “Well, I just wanted you to know that I think you did a good job and I appreciated your efforts.”


He looked relieved. Charla pushed an envelope his way saying, 


“You’ve earned this letter of recommendation.”


“Thank you,” he said, taking it and pocketing the letter in his jacket’s breast pocket. “I was going to ask but I didn’t want to push it.”


“Can I take you out for lunch? Show you my appreciation for all of your coffee runs.”


“Uh, yeah sure. Thanks.”


The two walked to a noisy steak house where she and Jason got a booth in a dark corner where the ordered lunch and drinks. The two never returned to the office, drinking the afternoon away, as she shared her tips on how to succeed in cut throat corporate America. When Charla saw the orange light of a sunset glaring through the one shaded window, she realized how late it was. The crowd was becoming more raucous and women in tight dresses were now mixing with the men at the bar. Her buzzing phone skittered over the table. She picked it up, tapping the screen to read the message.


From: Thomas Keller ‘Sorry. Can’t make it.’


Translation: ‘Sorry, I found a hotter woman.’


“Shit,” she said, slamming down her phone.


“What?” he asked.


“That was my date for tonight. He can’t make it. I’m about to lose a bet.”


His brows furrowed in confusion. She sipped her drink and thought what the hell, tell the guy. The shock value alone will be worth it.


“My girlfriends and I give each other sex toys, you know to spice up our sex lives, and we take pictures of using them as proof that they were used. If you don’t, you have to buy the girls a gift. We meet tomorrow. I need to prove that I used my gift.”


“And what did you get, if you don’t mind me asking?”


Charla looked both ways before pulling the box from her bag and handing it to him. She had planned to go straight to her date after work and had brought them along. Jason opened the box and looked at the heavy silver balls.


“What are these?” he asked.


“They’re Ben Wa balls. They’re used to tighten and stimulate your pussy.”


He quickly closed the box and handed it back to her. His eyes lingered on hers before looking down in submission. He grabbed his beer.


He asked, “So you just going to shove them in?”


“My date was going to do that and take the picture.”


“So, you need help?”


She looked at him and laughed. He looked dejected and she stopped laughing to reach out and touch his hand.


“You’re my intern. There’s this thing called ethics.”


“As of four p.m., I’m no longer your intern.” 


The executrix and her former intern took a ride share to the lower east side where they walked up a flight of stairs to her apartment. He looked around her airy modern apartment three times larger than his with teak wood floors, plush rugs, well placed artwork and streamline furniture.


“Drink?” she asked.


“Sure. I’ll have what you’re having,” he said, sitting on a butter yellow leather couch.


She stepped into her kitchen and sliced some lime before throwing ice into two tumblers, splashing vodka over them and garnishing the drinks with lime wedges. She handed him his drink and sat beside him, drunkenly kicking off her shoes.


He said, “Nice place.”


“Thanks,” she said, gazing at him with a silly grin on her face as she played with her hair.


“I’ve got to be honest with you. You made my day when you walked by my desk. The way your ass flexes under those tight skirts, it made me chub every time. I mean I’m not sick, and I was taught to respect women, but you,” he said, biting his lip. 


“You, with that dark hair and those blue eyes and that body. I just wanted to get up in that.”


“You watched me walk by?”


“Every day.”


She giggled before kissing him again and again until they were making out like horny teens in the backseat of a car. His arms pulled her against him until her boobs smashed against his body. Panting, she pushed him away and he opened his eyes to see her flushed face.


“The balls,” she said. “I need to get a picture.”


He sat up as she reached for her purse and pulled out the box and her phone. She set the phone on the coffee table before removing one ball from the box which she raised between the both of them. He kissed it with his bow shaped lips which brushed her fingertips. She handed him a ball before standing to her feet to unzip and shimmy out of her pants. She stepped out of her panties and stripped off her top as well, to stand in front of him dressed only in a black scalloped lace bra. He couldn’t take his off the neat strip of sable fuzz on his boss lady’s pussy inches from his nose. The steel ball was warming in his hand as she leaned over to loosen his tie and unbutton his shirt. She kissed his waiting lips, straddling his lap to sit her naked bottom on his thighs. She took his face in his hands and kissed his lips before drunkenly falling over onto the couch. She giggled, flexing her pedicured toes, lazily gazing at him as she watched her handsome young assistant get up.


“You want to take pictures, Ms. Fox?” he said, getting up to aim the lamp light her way. “Let’s make a movie.”


Jason picked up her camera, aimed it at the couch, and propped it up against a candle before pressing on the video recording button. He plucked the second ball from its box as Charla became comfortable spreading her legs a little to accommodate him.
The camera recorded as he bent to lick her clit. Her fingers roamed in his soft hair as she pressed his head into her moist private warmth. He looked up into the camera before kissing the silver ball, then backed up to insert it inside her wet fold. Charla moaned with pleasure. Her head sank into plush pillows as she processed the feeling of heavy cold steel inside her. Jason backed away to make sure the camera caught it all. He stared at his former boss writhing and hissing like a cat in heat, knees up, cunt out, her swollen pink nub peeking out from between her controlled fuzziness. The sight made him very hard in his pants which he’d take off only if invited. He still thought of her as the boss lady but he couldn’t take it anymore. He dove down between her legs to suck on what teased him the most. 


“Oh, Mr. Graham,” she said, enjoying the weight of the ball inside her as his tongue tripped and slopped over her clit. 


She contracted and relaxed her Kegel muscles over and over, feeling the steel ball against her soft accommodating insides as Jason planted his palm on her inner thigh to spread her legs and lick a little deeper inside her. He took the second ball and popped it into her pink moistness. She arched her back against the couch as he nuzzled the secret flesh he was privileged to kiss. 

Charla panted out, “Okay, turn off the camera.” 

Jason reached over for the phone, fumbling with it until the screen went black. 


He asked, “You want me to take them out?”


“What’s the rush?”


He returned to his obsession, burying his head between her legs once more. Charla clutched her knees around his shoulders as she sighed in absolute heaven at the tongue bath he was giving. It went on all night.


Charla awoke in her bed to the grey morning light with Jason beside her. She nearly panicked when her arm hit his back curled up beside her. With an overwhelming sensation to pee, she got up, wrapped a robe around her and walked into the bathroom. She peed as she held the Ben Wa balls still in her. She wiped and rose a little, steadying herself into a squat to take out the balls. She was just about to insert a finger to fish them out when she thought about it. Maybe her pussy does need a little tightening. After all, the ex-husband was a stud with a solid nine inches of girthy length. Four years of his kind of pounding would make any girl wonder if her pussy will snap back into shape. Hmmmm. Maybe she’ll wear them a little longer. "

The only offer I got for this fall was internship from 11~15 ranked firm that I didn't even recruit with.
I don't really want to discount any smaller firms, but my plan was to get an offer from one of the big 7 firms. 

My question to you guys. Should I stick to this firm and end my recruiting or take a risk by declining further full time offer(if they choose to offer me).

I want to hear your opinions. What did you do in these kind of situations or what would you do."

Volume 2 will come out in a few weeks, after my players wrap up another campaign in the same setting.

The premise of the campaign was simple. A wild west setting with a three-way civil war, in the northern badlands. Our heroes began as many adventurers do, saving a town from goblins. The party was thrown together hastily, with need and availability as driving factors in party creation. [Vittle](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AzrQt07zy9w/maxresdefault.jpg), a ratfolk alchemist with aspirations of necromancy, owned a Cap of Human Guise and appeared as a Halfling most of the time.  [Jeremiah](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/0a/3e/36/0a3e36414ae5842351eda4c8d4a8b463.jpg), a redneck human cleric of Erastil accompanied by his falcon familiar Stringfellow, sought to ensure harmony and justice throughout the north. [Ari](http://img08.deviantart.net/fe89/i/2006/255/2/b/cheshire_cat_by_somethingfeline.jpg), a lyrical catfolk bard, mostly wanted recognition and praise. [Wade](http://img4.mmo.mmo4arab.com/feature/kingdomunderfire2/gunslinger.jpg), a human brawler, would have been a paladin had he been raised in another environment. He simply wanted to take care of others and do the right thing. These adventurers quickly vanquished the goblins and dispersed the gathering horde of other monstrous humanoids by killing its leader. Overnight, they became heroes.

The party wandered from place to place, adventure to adventure. They stopped slavers from trapping Fey, forcibly restructured the leadership of the Tuckus Clan crime syndicate, saved the king from assassination on his deathbed, and redeemed a town from the clutches of an Efreeti summoned by an apprentice who didn't know what he was doing. They made various friends and contacts along the way. They met Atnas, a jolly dwarven bard, when they shared a campsite with him. Ari sang a bit while he fiddled, and the party looked forward to their meetings with him. They met Atriflyn, eternal elven Guardian of the North, whilst acting as escorts for a messenger. They stumbled upon the trapper Burrhis every now and then, who would yell at them for disturbing his traps set for various animals. Initially, the party was confused when they saw a carrot laying in the road, as bait for his rabbit trap. He soon grew to foxes, wolves, bears, and then owlbears. Jeremiah prayed that Burrhis would not trap something larger than he could handle. When solving the case of a serial killer, they met [Soren](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/e3/e4/5b/e3e45b5ae095b17e595bc132570016d9.jpg), a masked half-orc sorcerer with an obsession with dragons and fire. Soren joined the party as an equal, though he couldn't understand why everyone kept referring to Vittle (clearly a normal adult halfling) as a rat. There were other figures, of course, like the poor single mother whom Wade financially supported, or the dwarven loggers and the dinosaur-riding druids, but that would be telling a different tale.

The strands of fate began to intertwine with an ill encounter with a band of ogres. A wounded girl in ragged clothes approached the party, saying that her sisters had been taken captive by ogres. The party naturally agreed to help her. The girl led them through some rough terrain and through a hilly region. Just when Jeremiah began to think that the terrain was a perfect plan for an ambush, ogres started pouring down the hillside. The girl revealed herself as a hag and joined her coven sisters. The party split their attention between the coven and the ogres, with Wade taking on the full brunt of the assault almost single-handedly. In-between arrow shots, Jeremiah cast a silence spell on Stringfellow and directed the falcon to fly above the hag coven to disrupt their casting. One of the hags grew to a monstrous height and snatched the bird from the sky, crushing it instantly. Wade finished off the ogres with crossbow assistance from Vittle, and the hags scattered. Though heavily injured, Jeremiah cast a fly spell on himself and flew after the hag which had slain his familiar. Seeing him separated from the rest of the party, the hag turned on Jeremiah and slew him. Soren had flown after Jeremiah and witnessed his death. Before the hag turned on him, he blurted out his willingness to switch sides, while telling his own familiar to warn the party, who had finished off one of the other hags, while the last escaped. The hag with Soren agreed to his deception and was baited into the ogre cave where it was slain after a tense battle with the rest of the party. There, the party did find three girls held captive, whom Wade immediately freed and started giving first aid. Of perhaps greater concern was a note which was addressed to any and all worshipers of Lamashtu, goddess of monstrous humanoids. She planned to establish her own rule in the North, where the adventurers called home. They tucked the note away and limped back to town with Jeremiah's body in tow.

Shortly before they reached town, they encountered the trapper Burrhis again, negotiating with a [woman dressed as an adventurer](http://jortagul.deviantart.com/art/Aelys-400116062). Behind her was a massive hill giant on a cart, tied up and unconscious. The woman was apologizing for slaying the man's owlbear, saying that she had brought him what he had been trying to catch. Burrhis accepted this, then declared that he now had everything he needed for his dragon trap before wandering off. The woman saw the party and introduced herself as Jill. She said that while she had taken down that hill giant herself, there were limits to what a solo adventurer could do. She asked if she could join the party, at least for some time. Immediately, the adventurers began to suspect that this was the hag which had escaped them earlier, come back to exact revenge and kill them in their sleep. This was seemingly confirmed when Vittle's magical crossbow determined that her alignment really was evil. Jill refuted this, saying that she was an orphan raised by full-blooded orcs, but a person's natural disposition wasn't deterministic of their actions. She took off all her magical gear, then said that if that wasn't enough, then she couldn't trust them. After confirming that Jill was not under any illusion or polymorph spells (and could not be the last hag), Soren removed his mask and revealed his tusked face. He said that he understood her point about not wanting to be judged by others. After a quick party council, the adventurers decided to accept Jill on a trial basis, watching their backs to make sure she wouldn't stick a knife in them. Not that she had knives, of course. Her only weapons were two saps, a weapon of nonviolence if there ever was one. The first night back in town, Soren observed Jill sneaking out of their inn to go to a thieves' den. Shen proceeded to incapacitate every thief, plant some very illegal poison in a desk drawer, then leave a note for the town guard. When Soren asked her about this, she said that she was just wrapping up some unfinished business. When he shared this with the rest of the party, they decided that while Jill may be evil, she was still the honorable type.The party let Jill accompany them and referred to her as their intern.

When Jeremiah was raised from the dead, the party set out on more adventures with Jill. A dragon egg which they had been carrying hatched, much to Soren's delight. The party recovered a holy artifact of Irori from a temple which had been submerged under a river. Of some concern was a forest town which had been slaughtered down to the last man, which the party did not solve. The disturbing note from the ogre cave resulted in the great wizard Atriflyn calling a gathering of heroes from across the land to do battle with the armies of Lamashtu while she banished Lamashtu's herald from the land. At this gathering, the party discovered that Jill and Atnas knew each other, and that Atnas had looked after her for a brief time during her childhood. He vouched for her character, and the party's last remnants of unease were put to rest. The battle with Lamashtu's herald went off smoothly. Ari displayed her true worth of providing supernatural morale and courage to the entire gathering of heroes. Jill participated on an equal footing, and after this, her status as intern was a mere formality. Atriflyn promised each participant a hand-crafted reward of their choosing, which she would complete in the following months.

A few months later, Vittle received a sending from Atriflyn, saying that their rewards were ready to be picked up. As the party made their way to her tower, they were ambushed by two summoners. They identified themselves as the last remnants of the Tuckus Clan. The summoners were defeated, but they identified Jill as the culprit behind the mass murder of their clan. The party had not parted on good terms with the clan, as they had tried to rob Wade, and so they were not actually upset by this accusation. Wade even joked that if she had done it, she would have done him a favor. The party still wanted an explanation though, so Jill told them a bit more of her past. She had been raised by orcs, but she had a biological younger sister who was also raised up with her. While Jill had been taught evil and come to live by it, her sister reveled in it and all of its cruelties and sufferings. Jill pleaded with the party to finish off the summoners, which the party readily agreed to do. They then proceeded onwards without a second thought about the matter.

Rumors began to spread of a lich who was creating an undead army in the mountains. The party seemed to always have more pressing issues to take care of, until they were surprised one night by a large group of Blast Shadows. The party began to track down rumors of this lich in town, while Jeremiah and his new roc familiar scouted the mountains for traces of where the blast shadows had come from. He managed to backtrack into the foothills of the mountains before he felt a magical pressure on his mind. Jeremiah shook off the influence and left to rejoin his compatriots. The party discovered in the capital that a lich could not be destroyed while its phylactery was still intact, which would be hidden far from the lich's current location. However, the party also heard that an artifact of life could be used to trace the path which a lich's spirit took to its phylactery when its body was destroyed. The only artifact of life which they knew of, the Branch of Life, was private property of a noble house. While scouting out the noble house, they saw a mysterious figure break in. They discovered that this was Wade's sister, who filled them in on the details of the situation. She was visiting a child of the noble house who was so physically ill that he could not leave the presence of the Branch of Life or he would begin to die. This was serendipitous, however, since the Branch could not tolerate anyone in its presence for long who was not holy and good, which few people were. Borrowing the Branch was out of the question, but the party conferred with the child and took him along with the Branch, under the cover of night. The child and Wade's sister traveled separately from the party on Jeremiah's roc familiar, while Jill and the party rode the waterways by boat, then later by foot. The group traveled this way until they reached the site where Jeremiah had felt the magical attack.

The group began a search for the lich's hideout and discovered a likely candidate in the form of a cave in the side of a mountain. They made their plan. Jeremiah would take the Branch of Life for safekeeping. The party and Jill would enter the cave, while the child and Wade's sister waited outside. The child assured them that he could survive a few hours without the Branch, though they vowed not to take this long. If the party found the lich, they would destroy him, use the Branch of Life to track down his spirit to his phylactery, and destroy him for good there. They prepared their equipment and spells, then entered the cave.

After fighting a few cultists acting as guards, the party discovered that the entire cave had been set up with magical guards and wards, inhibiting their progress. Fog, spiderwebs, hidden doors, and disorienting intersections confounded them at every turn. Nevertheless, they battled through groups of undead and cultists as they cleared the dimly-lit dungeon. While interrogating one of the cultists, they learned that there was no lich... yet. However, the head necromancer was in the middle of his ceremony to become one. The group eventually made their way to a set of large mithral doors with loud chanting on the other side. The party buffed up, steeled themselves, then disintegrated the wall beside the doors and rushed in. 

The found the necromancer with a horde of lackeys, and his top spellcasting devotees. The necromancer hit Jeremiah with a feeblemind spell which caused him to lose command of his divine magic, though he could still shoot his bow. Soren was trading with the spellcasters, though he was obviously outmatched due to numbers. Wade was taking care of the mundane lackeys, and Vittle and Ari were helping Soren against the spellcasters. Then Jill stepped forward and approached the necromancer. The party had seen how effective she could be in combat, and they held their breath in anticipation of if she would be able to take him down. 

Instead of fighting him, Jill dropped to one knee, reached into her pack, and presented the necromancer with the Branch of Life. The necromancer smiled and said, ""Finally, the last piece of my ritual."" The party fell into despair, as they realized they had been played all along. The rumors of a lich had been started by Jill, as well as the method of tracking down the lich's spirit to defeat him permanently. She had been the one who had been responsible for the massacre of the one forest town as well as the Tuckus Clan. She wasn't raised by orcs. She had no sister. While she did spend some time with Atnas, it was only when she had just run away from home. She was and always had been dedicated to the necromancer, becoming his most trusted henchman. And now, she had hoodwinked the party into doing what she could never have done herself: deliver a pure, holy artifact which removed itself from the presence of evildoers, into the hands of a necromancer who would use it for his most unholy ritual.

It then fell upon the party to try to salvage the wrong that they had done. Vittle ran into the middle of a group of enemies and detonated himself, taking them out in a self-sacrifical blaze of glory. Jeremiah's feeble mind could not comprehend what was going on, but he kept firing at the enemy spellcasters. Ari was singing and using minor magic, until she was trapped behind a wall of stone. Soren managed to get a lucky fireball in which dealt serious damage to the necromancer and Jill. The necromancer grabbed Jill, waved his staff, and teleported away, leaving the party to deal with the remaining spellcasters. They managed, though not before the spellcasters had also dealt serious damage to Wade. In the end, a bloodied Wade, a drooling Jeremiah, a shell-shocked Ari, and a singed Soren were left standing over a room full of corpses. They did not relish the idea of going outside and seeing the convulsing body of the boy they had sworn to return the Branch to, or Wade's sister, who had displayed complete and utter trust in them. Nor were they keen on going back to the capital, where they were most assuredly wanted criminals for kidnapping and theft of a holy relic. They did, however, swear that if they ever crossed paths again, that would be the day to Kill Jill."
59maa8,7,2016-10-27,My(23F)previous summer internship emailed me today about work that was supposed to be completed during my internship over the summer. I'm conflicted on if I owe them the work or not.,LadybugLotLizard,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/59maa8/my23fprevious_summer_internship_emailed_me_today/,"Hear me out. This is a little complicated, but I hope my opinion comes across.

In September 2015 I was hired as an unpaid intern at a education based non-profit in my city. I would be working with their marketing and PR side. While working on their marketing side, I supported: fundraising, writing, event coordinating, etc. I worked long hours and did extra whenever I could. To be honest, it was my dream job. I loved every second of it. During my time there, I was able to establish concrete relationships with other non-profits and organizations in our city. I implemented new strategies and techniques for future interns. I went above and beyond because I loved my job.

During the summer, there was an opportunity for me to become a paid intern that was supported by a big name grant. Most of these grants go to students in top tier universities. I received the grant and the paid internship based on my experience with the organization. This grant was for a more technical side of the non-profit. I would be creating video games that would go along with our work. Over the first two weeks, signs were being shown that it was going to be much more hectic than I was informed.

On top of my additional work, I was asked to teach classes. I don't have a teaching degree, nor am I certified to teach. I was asked to support another school and additional hours of teaching. I wasn't paid the same amount as my fellow teaching partner even though we did the same amount of work. Then I was asked to teach another set of classes. However, during this time, I was supposed to learn how to play the new games and create my own. I spent half the day teaching and the other half driving from school to school. I also work full time as a server in a restaurant. 

Towards the end of my internship, I worked at five schools when I should've only worked at two. I also taught at those schools which wasn't a part of my internship at all. I was mostly supposed to support the teachers. At the very end of my internship, I was supposed to have created a game to go with some learning material. I didn't have time to even play the game. Sure, I could've done it on the weekend, but I was working 80 hr weeks (internship + my job)/6 days a week. I was miserable. 

At the very end of my internship I found an opportunity outside of my city. At this point, the non-profit wanted to find a way to hire me on. I'm also a junior in college. I knew that if I stayed, I wouldn't graduate on time. I'm also supporting myself through school and I couldn't bare the thought of working that many hours for more than I already had. I took the opportunity to move and now I'm in my new city. I love it here and I don't plan on moving back anytime soon. They did mention that if I ever wanted a job, there's one waiting for me there.

During the first month of my living in my new city, I received an email about the game I was supposed to have made. Moving doesn't always go as planned and I was at my wits end. I was settling into a terrible roommate situation, stress with my new job, and transferring from a community college to a university. I apologised but said I didn't complete it. I told them that I would complete it by the end of September if they wanted me to. I emailed that on September 4th. Today, October 26th, I recieve an email asking to have it by November 4th as they want to show it to future interns. My head damn near exploded. It's been nearly three months since I emailed my intern mentor back about not completing it. I am in the middle of midterms, I recieved a promotion at work, I'm writing part-time, and DJing on weekdays. I have literally zero time to dedicate to creating this game. I feel guilty because that was a part of the agreement, but things change. I didn't have time to create a video game show creating lessons and teaching k-12 students all summer. 

Am I being a huge brat about this?

tl;dr Previous internship wants me to complete work that I would've completed this summer had they not changed the dynamic of my internship."
59meeo,0,2016-10-27,I hate my boyfriend,sadandconfused4,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/59meeo/i_hate_my_boyfriend/,"I've been dating my boyfriend for the past 17 months. The first months were perfect: I honestly thought he was the love of my life. During the half year mark, things kind of went downhill. We fought and argued all the time about really insignificant and small things. I admit a lot of that was my fault for starting the arguments and I've been working really hard to start less fights with him. I was honestly a terrible girlfriend. I didn't understand his needs and his busy schedule and constantly broke up with him because of it, only to feel terrible when he would call and cry and beg for me back. During this period, we were really on and off. We'd break up and get back together every few weeks. It was honestly an awful relationship. 

This past weekend, he got mad at me for going out with my friends and drinking and decided to text me that the relationship was over. He said he didn't love me and didn't feel the same and hasn't been feeling the same toward me for a while. After, he decided he wanted to talk again. I didn't really want to talk anymore so I wrote down everything I had to say, about how I loved him and I don't regret the past 17 months and now saying goodbye to him is difficult, even if we did end because our relationship was getting to be so terrible. I told him that I'd love him no matter what and I just wanted him to be happy, whether or not that was with me I'd be okay with it. However, he read it and broke down asked to date me again. I was reluctant at first but I honestly do love him and missed him and agreed to try again. But now our fights are still there. Tonight he started yelling at me during dinner because I told him I wasn't hungry and didn't feel like eating. Then he was irritated with me for talking about interviewing for internships. I'm applying for a bunch of investment banking internships and the stress is really getting to me, so I'm obviously hoping he can be supportive during this time. After when I asked him to watch a movie, he declined, saying he wasn't interested and said nothing we do is even fun anymore. He then asked me why we are even together. These questions honestly really hurt me and I ended up crying. We talked again and I told him that I loved him. He obviously didn't say it back. We both went to sleep, but I woke up a while later feeling super shitty that we were arguing yet again, and so I opened my phone and looked at instagram. I noticed that he refollowed the girl he emotionally cheated on me with. He woke up because I woke up and basically said it wasn't a big deal and told me to ""stop fucking talking"" because I was being ""really fucking annoying"" and ""pissing him off"". 

I just don't know what to do anymore. I want my old boyfriend back. I honestly love him but things aren't the same and this relationship is falling apart before my eyes and nothing I do can seem to fix it. "

59mvnp,0,2016-10-27,5e Thoughts &amp; Insane ramblings regarding them Familiars.,Luxif,DnD,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/59mvnp/5e_thoughts_insane_ramblings_regarding_them/,"After obsessing over this recently, and seeing other people... blabber. Insert Arrogance here, and a dash there for good measure..

I would argue that 5e familiars are somewhat... lacking. Like anything they are a nice accessory? utility? expression of self, for spell casters, and that 5e has muddled them compared to lets say, 3.5e. 5e seems to take after 4e in which case it is... Spirits. Rather than magic damned animals or the entities itself. 

Now okay, a fey, fiend, or celestial taking the shape of animals. Apart from fluff, or maybe having the familiar have a personality of its own if played decently, its probably just a useless tack on, with some minor utility. 

Can not attack, which even if it could, it would not do that much damage realistically, especially later on. Does not really matter.

I really am just ranting, desiring someone with constructive thinking rather than, the book says this and that. So excuse that.

I also really hate the existence of familiar variant boxes in the MM for the Chain Pact familiars. Why add it if its for shitty NPCs to be more overpowered? Why just for them? Players are just going to want it as Chain Pact is kind of meh. Plus, it differentiates chain pact and fits with its kind of thematic (Actually contracting/befriending entities). 

Chain Pact could use a more... modified/clear Find Familiar variant. The first paragraph of find familiar talks about spirits taking animal shape and said spirits are celestial/fey/fiend. Imps/Quasits are fiends and spirits, who can take animal form as per their shapechange. I would argue that Chain gets you the next level spirits up the food chain, Lemures vs Imps for example. Regular familiars, are lemures or other weaker level spirits: That Fiendish Raven ye got? A Lemure. Chain gets you the next step up, Imps/Whatever Quasits are.  A Lemure is basically a... shapeless mud thing anyways, so maybe becoming fiendish familiars lets them get shape... or are easily manipulated by magic users since they are puddle monster things. Not familiar with Celestial/Fey, so I couldnt say for them.

Take out the change their shape at will section, as Imps/Quasits have their own shapechanging abilities to three other familiar-esque creatures. Shunting them off to hammer space? Dismiss them back to their home plane. Psuedodragons break this mold, I would just consider them telepathically linked dragonlike cats. No shapeshifting, no hammerspaces. 

Chain Pact = Entities. More varied abiliites, can attack, and more cunning/intelligent than random formless spirits you manipulate. They have their own will/personality as they would, or your patron demands of them. Acting Independently/Their own turn, but giving up your attack for them to? Pretending the action economy is not a thing, that sounds weird as shit. In the Errata? They attack as their reaction, so they can use their other abilities. Make them use your attack to preserve action economy, but let them turn invis or shapechange out of shit and attack? Where is that preservation? Both is not an option, pick a side.  

Find Familiar - Weird shit that 4e fucked up and 5e kept and that become useless, while in 3.5e they at least leveled with you, even if they still were weaksauce. Formless spirits that maybe serve mortals as a weird internship type deal?

TLDR: Familiars are weird as shit, writers should not make random familiar variants and then say *NPC Only* because they do not even need such shit in the first place and people get jelly. Said NPC only is from their twitter/maybe Error fixing/Sage Advice? I have seen a tweet of it, at the most.

I went back and modified shit, ranted more, and added WHITE SPACE. This is me also probably needing some more... ground rules, simply because the lack of some while more... open, can also breed confusion and lack of cheese platters. 

Rant over, if you disagree, I will probably dislike you, if you agree, I will probably like you. If you blabber without any constructiveness in either regard, I will probably imagine you as cat memes.

This was by far the most memorable trips I've ever made and now I want to do more. I'm living in the Netherlands and currently following a study were I get the opportunity to do an intern in America in my third year. Now I really want to explore more and as my trip to Africa was really expensive I'm kinda on a budget. I look for something to do during my summerbreak for 2-4 weeks but what is different from what people 'usually' do. I want an experience which I will remember. I love culture, meeting people and activitys like cliffjumping, bungeejumping, mountainclimbing, cavediving, kayaking etc. (These are stuff Ive done) I want to DO something on my trips.
I hope anyone can share travels they've done and have any advice on where I can start looking.
Thanks in advance! And sorry for any grammarmistakes."

I've helped others cope with loss of loved ones.

I've aced all of my midterms in classes usually reserved for seniors (I'm a junior).

I've had almost a dozen great interviews.

I've already got 4 or so internship offers lined up for the summer.

I've lost a considerable amount of weight and I'm in the best shape of my life.

I've started my $50/hour freelance job.

I've gone on a couple of dates.

I've regained connections with friends, and made quite a few new ones.

I've furthered my research and my research supervisor/professor asked me to attend a very small meeting of the lab group with DARPA, NIST, and JPL. I'm an undergraduate. This is huge for me.

And despite it all I still feel bad from time to time but that's ok. I'm still sad about what happened but I don't want her back. She was a bad partner, cheating, secrets, withdrawing affection whenever she felt like it.

She took a step down and is dating someone of her caliber now.

Me?  I'm just getting started on upgrading my own life while she stays complacent in hers.  I won't stand for mediocrity again.

To any of you out there having trouble with this, don't worry. It will get better in time. I promise.  It won't be easy and it won't be linear. You'll have good days and bad. But it does get better."
59oocl,3,2016-10-27,Making a humidifier that can be controlled by an app - Could use some advice,Masterpoda,arduino,https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/59oocl/making_a_humidifier_that_can_be_controlled_by_an/,"I work at as an intern at a small engineering firm that specializes in electronic controls for HVAC systems. We're looking into adding functionality to our newest product that would allow the user to control the humidifier from anywhere with an app. What would be the best way to do this? We currently have an ESP8266 on the Humidifier that allows it to connect to the internet.

There are lots of services like Thingspeak that allow users to control IoT devices, but we want there to be as little set-up as possible for the customer, and Thingspeak requires quite a bit of setup for each device. We would also like to minimize the back-end work we have to do, as none of us have extensive experience with databases (Though it seems like a SQL database is likely the best option for us).

We aren't interested in doing any kind of analytics on customer data, so if we have no access to customer information, that is acceptable.

Ideally this is how each device would work:
1. Turn on humidifier, and select your local wifi network on the touch screen.
2. Download the app and enter the serial number of the humidifier (possibly other credentials to ensure security)
3. Control 3-4 device settings from anywhere with the app

59qtm8,1,2016-10-27,What in the world has happened to the good ole me,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/59qtm8/what_in_the_world_has_happened_to_the_good_ole_me/,"Hey guys;

This is my first post ever on reddit and I'm not a native speaker of english - keep that in mind.

So... I'm a 23yo male brazilian law student (currently in 4th year), live in a big city in Bahia with my grandma. Life was going somewhat good on last couple years until this fucking 2016: Straight A's, good body shape, a very nice internship in a prosecutor office (which I was 13th among 2,000 candidates in the test), etc.

And then things started to go downhill like neglecting social life, barely partying, making escuses for friends... Stopped dating... Part of that is because I was getting older and don't owned a car (still don't), which is crazy expensive in Brazil, but a must have in dating nonetheless.

Still, the biggest part of my life and existence is STUDY, I love to do it... LOVE THE LAW, love to know things - in spite of the stated above, at the time I was still studying like crazy... Well not for long.

Mainly in vacations I started to face somewhat lightweight depression, cannot study, skiped some workouts and whatnot, but when the classes begun I was all in for it and returned to my routine.

These crisis started to grow longer and longer, in a point I stayied a whole month in bed just watching Battlestar Galatica (frak me) - but when classes came, I was ready for return to my routine. 

Harmless, right?! Ok, last vacation I was really mess up and looked for a psychiatrist since my mom thought I was depressed. She prescribed me Wellbutrin 150mg/day. On that point things gott pretty serious: frequent suicidal thoughts, mainly about hanging myself in the yard, stopped working out, started to eat a lot of junk, and just doing nothing all day long. This was in  the first weeks on the medicine.

Now I'm slightly better about the crazy stuff (sucide and such) but still unproductive, can't study, terrible grades, skipping classes every week, stopped workout completely (NEVER HAPPENED!), and while writing this I supposed to be at Civil Process IV class, if I skip one more I fail the course... Yet here I am. Almost a month I don't go to college.

I just wanted to let it out, feels good writing this down since nobody really knows. I'd really appreciate to hear your intake of all this!

59r037,287,2016-10-27,Post-residency discussion: The ICU and floor Nurses and malignant relationships with MDs,The_Silmarillion,medicine,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/59r037/postresidency_discussion_the_icu_and_floor_nurses/,"So now that I'm a few months past being signed and having a normal life, I figured it would be nice to post this discussion with hindsight being 20/20.  I work in an open ICU and take care of patients on both the floor and the critically ill as a normal day on my hospitalist service.  It's fun for the most part, and interactions with staff at my institution are thankfully pleasant.  It calls back to mind, though, a time in life when those interactions were not pleasant.  Residency.  Specifically with nursing.



Please don't slaughter me; I know theres a lot of RN/NP/LPN readers on the sub.  I love you guys.  I truly do.  I just wanted to discuss the relationships between doctors and nursing from a doctor's perspective.   I don't see a lot of MD's doing this (though can barely open facebook or reddit without seeing the opposite).  Just wanted to add my two cents.  The things I say apply to both ICU and floor nurses.



When I think back to residency, some of the most frustrating experiences I had weren't with my co-physicians or admins, but rather with nurses.   Through my experience practicing med (6 years total which still is NOTHING in the scheme of things) I've seen this to be a common threat.  This sort of behavior applies to interactions with attendings as well, mind you, but that's much more behind-the-back and for times sake we will focus on residents.



I guess to start the discussion, I'd like to make a statement.  The interactions between nursing and residents, while often good, often has underlying adversarial tones with certain subsets of people in the profession (both doctors and nurses).  I do not know where some young RNs (and not to overgeneralize, but the 22-30 year old crowd is the most guilty in my experience) get the idea that they know more than doctors, especially in the Intensive Care Unit.  Even at the place I work now (teaching facility) it's still mind-blowing hearing some of the comments made on a regular basis from the nursing team about the resident team.  It's not just going for blood; it's more aquin to going for the jugular and trying to rip it out.  Remarks along the lines of ""I stop baby doctors from killing people"" is absolutely, positively astounding to hear from a 25 year old RN.  Astounding.




The ICU mentality is even worse, and I am understadning of the reasons why nurses feel that way.  I feel, though, that at teaching institutions the sort of behavior I observe from a small amount of nurses is completely reprehensible and it is only getting worse.  I do not know how this sort of idea that they know more than an entry-level resident on the case came about, and even though they may have a better sense when a patient may need pressors off a whim than the intern on service, it is absolutely no grounds for disrespect.  Furthermore, that disrespect sows the seeds of bad relationships...which is kind of the antithesis of actual success in medicine and learning.  We're all here to learn.  That would be like the accountant pointing out something on the CEOs tax returns and screaming that ""HA I KNOW BETTER.""  It's all a matter of perspective.  That aforementioned nurse may know the pressors really good, but that second year junior resident is there to learn the pathophysiology, everything that can go wrong, how to find it, how to fix it, and how to humanistically tell the family (amongst other things).  It's all a matter of perspective and its disgusting that EITHER side gets egos involved.




I'll never forget a story from my final year of residency when the resident on the other team was attempting to get a radial art line but failed and needed to go for a femoral approach.  Pt. was phenomenally unstabile and his intern had royally fucked the radial to angiospasm 10 times over and we really needed invasive monitoring.  No fem kits available in this unit (in a tertiary referral center WTF but thats another story) so my colleage decied to use the largest radial available and successfully got a wave form and pressure on the monitor.  We were able to ascertain his pressure for real, get him on the right meds due to this, and stabilize a hypotensive man with a scary as fuck looking junctional tachyarrhythmia.

  This 23 year old nurse went around after seeing he used a radial on the fem and called him the ""dumbest fucking doctor she ever saw"" to every nurse and nursing student who would listen.  Most brushed it off, but rumors find a way of being fuck all stupid.  The line blew later the next day when they proned the patient for ARDS and this particular specimen of a nurse of course attributed it to my friend.  She finally was disciplined.  Like I said, just an example.  But I think all of us in the profession as a whole have seen the trend that some nurses have taken this attiitde.



On the bright side...there are SO MANY FUCKING AMAZING NURSES OUT THERE and DOCTORS DONT THANK THEM ENOUGH.  We should.  We have no excuses.  I honestly believe so much of the good has come out of the bad ones setting such a bad example that they know they must avoid.  I swear to God on my life a good nurse has saved my ass so many more times than I can count.  Because of stuff like that I can't for the life of me understand why these up and comers and yunguns can't strive to be more like the leaders in their field as opposed to these new ""know it all"" Nurse Jackie wannabees.



TL;DR: I love nurses.  I just can't believe the attitude some of the younger ones have and how badly they treat residents while acting like they know everything.  It sucks how social media reinforces it.  It sucks and makes doctors look like the incompetent bad guys if these idiots get a louder voice.  "

5 months ago, I sabotaged my internship chance because I was getting daily anxiety attacks. I took a break from school because I skipped every single lecture since I cant even pay any attention. The only way to fall asleep was to drink. I used to have a passion for my hobbies, now doing things, even my hobbies, felt like a chore. I stopped playing computer games because I got frustrated too easily and I don't feel good anymore, even if I won. I hated my family for reasons unknown. I was angry at everyone.

 I floated between depression, where i have zero motivation to do anything at all, being bored of everything, and anxiety, where I am so jittery and on edge that I cant focus when im walking or driving, rushing thoughts of my future , contemplating suicide. I couldn't take it anymore.

I decided to get help after 2 nights of barely any sleep. After sharing everything with the psychiatrist, I was prescribed some meds. It was mirtazapine. It helped me in getting some sleep but I'm still very anxious and depressed. Then the psychiatrist added another med into the mix, vortioxetine. It took almost a month to feel any improvement from the meds.

Now, I would say that I'm in a much better place. I would say that I'm lucky to have found the exact meds that works for me with minimal side effects, and a supportive family who understands that I'm depressed and needed help.

I can't force you to seek help. I can only empathise and understand your feelings, since I've been through it before. I can only advice you to give yourself time to prepare yourself for help. You can't force yourself, nor others, to seek help. You have to want to get better for the treatment to work. "

59sta3,1,2016-10-28,my story,mets5ever,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/59sta3/my_story/,"I posted in the suicide watch thread, but I felt like this forum may be the best place to post my story of depression just to get everything out.  I've never told anyone my complete life story about describing everything that's happened that has made me as depressing as I am today.  

Sometime after I was born though I did not find out how old I was when this happened, My father was arrested for selling drugs and I ended up growing up with my relatives for as long as I can remember.  As far as my mother goes, she was a drug addict and did not live with me and my relatives.  Because of my parents' issues, one of my parents officially adopted me.  

For the first 8 years of my life, I grew up with my two aunts, who I'll call Cn and So, one of my first cousins, who I will call Cs, and my grandfather who I will call P.  I also had two uncles, called D and BE and another first cousin called LE.  As long as I can remember, I was always quiet although I would have no problem talking to kids about wrestling and video games.  I was also a well behaved kid so other kids would eventually make fun of me not just for that but also for how I look, calling me ugly.  

Whenever I would get insulted, I would get into fist fights but at the same time I would always be sad after the fights because I never wanted to hurt anyone.  When I would talk to my aunts at home about school, they would tell me not to be afraid to fight but at the same time, they never gave me any emotional comfort.  They never told me I was doing the right thing by behaving in school or never try to make me feel confident about how I look.  My grandfather was an alcoholic and would always be angry when drinking so I usually stood away from him.  None of my other relatives reached out to me though to try and make me feel better.  

Coming home from school was never easy to deal with either because my family members were always arguing with each other.  As I got older and I became more frustrated with how I was being treated at school and not getting any emotional support at home, I started to have attitude issues and always argue with my relatives.  They would always curse at me and we would just argue until everyone got tired and left to their rooms.  The worst person to deal with though was Cn.  Whenever we would argue, she would remind me how my father's a drug dealer in jail and remind me how my mom's too busy getting high instead of raising me and Ca would always complain about how she wishes I would grow up and move out of the house.  

When I was 7 or 8 years old, my father was coming out of jail to live with us.  At the time, I hated him because I was thinking about all the times Ca talked about him being a drug dealer and I eventually started thinking he was a terrible human being.  What also didn't help was he was using drugs while he was moving in with us.  I remember one time where Ca woke me up with a huge bag of drugs in her hand waving it at me yelling ""this is what your father does!""  So was never easy to deal with since she would always have an attitude complaining about how miserable her life was and would take it out on everyone else.  

Unfortunately, my relatives would act the same way whenever I would bring someone over to the house to play video games.  When I would get the chance to make friends at school, and bring them over, one of my aunts would start having an attitude right away.  I remember one time where as soon as I came into my house with a friend of mine, So would start yelling at me right away. I don't remember what the argument was about but I remember at one point, I threatened to jump out of a window and So would yell at me ""go ahead!"" I lived on the first floor of the building so it wasn't such a long jump to the ground from the window.  There was another time where I had a different friend over and Ca told him I was adopted and told him about my parents.  Of course he would tell the other kids at school, they would make fun of me, and I would start fights with different people.

Living in the projects did not help either since we did not always get hot water and with so many people living together, it was difficult to take a shower without someone wanting to use the bathroom.  There would be days where I would go to school and smell because I couldn't take a shower at home,  which would obviously become an issue once I became a teenager and started to smell when I sweat.

My mother stopped by to see me once when I was around 10 years old.  She had stopped by to bring me a birthday present.  I don't remember if she stopped by before or after my birthday but the day she stopped by was nowhere close to the date.  It was around this time where I found out I had a half brother and half-sister.  I felt so miserable with my current family members that I never felt comfortable meeting my half relatives.  I only saw them about 3 or 4 times.

The meetings with my half-sister and half-brother were setup by a social worker where not only would I meet them, but my mother was supposed to arrive and meet us.  She never arrived.  This may have been the time period where I started developing social anxiety.  I never felt comfortable meeting my half-relatives and I was feeling less and less comfortable talking to people in school since I was still getting into my share of fights and was constantly picked on.

When I got to junior High school, I started becoming somewhat quiet but I felt comfortable enough to socialize with people a little bit.  There were people who made fun of me for the same reasons people made fun in elementary school and I started to lose more confidence with myself over time.  It was during this time though, that one of my first cousins, Ca had a son, who  will call Mi who has been like a little brother to me.  If he wasn't alive, I probably would've committed suicide a long time ago.  My father was still living with us during this time, and my family would still argue with each other all the time.  Since my father couldn't get a regular job and wasn't home much, we did not go anywhere together ad I did not get to have any father son moments.

When it was finally time to enter high school, I just felt like instead of being more social, I had to rely more on being alone since I didn't wanna get into fights anymore or be made fun of my people.  I was very quiet most of the time,  I went from being a well behaved student in elementary and junior high school to showing up late constantly and not doing much work.  The older I got and the more depressed I got, the less important I felt school was. Unlike elementary and junior high school, people did leave me alone but I felt more lonely and was afraid of reaching out to others because of how I had been treated in the past.  Since I felt like I could never get any emotional help from my family, I never said anything to them until I was 16.  I was very depressed over the summer about being lonely with no friends and no girlfriend, I asked Ca if she could take me to therapy.  She said ""therapy's for crazy people"" but eventually she took me there.  She felt embarrased to be there and my other relatives made fun of me as well saying only crazy people go to see therapists.

Going to therapy actually made me feel more depressed because talking about my depression made me more upset since talking made me think more and I realized talking will never change anything.  When I said I wanted to stop going to therapy, the therapist tried to talk me into taking medication, which I was against because I didn't want to get involved with drugs like my parents.  I stopped going and because of this experience, I've never felt comfortable about giving therapy a second chance.

While I wanted to make friends in high school and wanted to start going on dates with girls,  I had no confidence in myself and was afraid of opening myself up to get treated badly by others.  I was so depressed about myself, I never thought I had a future and never bothered to plan on what I would be doing with my life after school since I figured I would've killed myself by then.

Somehow, I was able to graduate high school but I had no idea what to do with my life.  I was afraid of going to college because multiple teachers in high school complained about having large student loans to pay off and I thought if I went to college, I'd never be able to move away from my family due to owing so much money in debt.  It was around this time my father was able to move away but he would stay in contact with me more often than he did when he was living with me.  This was probably because he can talk to me over the phone without any of my relatives starting an argument with us.

I was so depressed about being alone and stressed out over figuring out how to make a living that I looked for something to do to help me relax for a little while until I can get my life together.  I eventually thought about going to a boxing gym to see if that will help me feel a little better.

I reached out to my father, who gave me money for a gym membership.  He also gave me spare money from time to time to buy video games on my own.  When he took me there, one of the trainers recognized him and decided to train me.  I will call the trainer Re.  He was the closest to a father figure I had.  Even though my father would give me the money for a membership, he would offer to take me to the gym and go home.  The problem was my father was never good at telling time.  There were a lot of times where he would show up hours late to take me to the gym or he would call me at the gym saying he wouldn't be able to pick me up.  Since I didn't know how to use mass transit very well,. I would stop relying on my father to pick me up and I would walk to gym and walk home, which was about a 45 minute walk each way.

After working out at the gym for about a month, I started getting more depressed and stressed out since I still had no clue about how to make a living and I still felt like I could never make any friends or meet a girl who would want to do anything with me.  One day I just started crying and told Re how I grew up and he tried to do the best he can to help me feel better.  It was around this time, my grandfather found out he got prostate cancer and died about a year later.

For the past 6 months after that, I would start going to different people in the gym for help and someone recommended a workforce center for help getting work.  I went to the workforce center, which directed me to another center, which provided job training and job classes.  When I got to this new center, I saw that they referred people to a non profit computer school and thought this was my best chance to make a living.

I went to the non-profit computer school and was able to finish the 3 1/2 month course but there were some difficulties with the school.  The first major issue being a lot of my classmates constantly complained about doing computer work and the teacher would spend a lot of time socializing instead of teaching.  At first, I was friendly with everyone but as time went on and the teacher spent less time teaching, I started isolating myself from everyone and focused on learning my own.

Another issue came up with this school after I finished the course.  Around the end of the course, they referred me to a job interview with a different non-profit company for an IT position.  The job title was ""IT Support Specialist"" where I would be handling all sorts of computer issues for all users within the office.  After two interviews, I got the position and for the first time in my life, I felt like my life was going in the right direction.  When I started the job though, it was a completely different story.

When I started the job, I found out all of the IT work is actually being performed in another office and the only IT work I would be doing is swapping desktop computers.  The rest of the work would be clerical work where I will be filing paperwork, entering data into a computer program, and taking calls at the front desk.  While the job was full time and the salary was $28,000 per year, I was upset about being lied to and I wanted to focus on a career in IT.  After 6 weeks, I gave my two week notice and left without thinking of the consequences.

This occurred in 2007, when the economy was not doing very well at all so in hindsight, it was a bad time to quit the job.  After I quit, The person in charge of the non-profit computer school called me asking what happened.  After I told her the situation, she replied ""nobody would hire you because you don't have any work experience.""  After hearing that response, I asked did she know what the job position really was before referring it and she said yes.  For the next 5 minutes, I yelled about how upset I was about being lied to and eventually hung up the phone.  Everyone in my family told me I made a bad decision even though I told them I wanted a computer job.  Both Re and the job counselor who referred me to the computer school did sympathize with how I felt about quitting and supported my decision even though it was not a good one financially.  It was around this time too, where Ca told me I have to start chipping in with the rent.  Not only was I angry about being lied to about a job, I was also stressed out over how I'm going to chip in with the bills.  

My father would give me money from time to time to chip in and at the same time, I would some of the money I made from the job I quit on computer books and certification exams.  After being lied to about the job, I did not feel like I can rely on anyone to help me get a good job so I stopped going to the workforce center and hoped getting IT certifications would help me get a good IT job.  Because I was so focused on finding work, I never went outside to socialize with others and never made any new friends to hang out and since I had no job, I felt like I could not approach any women.  

In summer 2008, I finally got an opportunity for an actual IT job.  It was an internship for $10 per hour but I felt like I had to accept any job I can get.  While I got to do all sorts of different tasks, I was very unhappy for most of the time I was at this position.  A couple of months after I started, one person got fired and another person quit and because of these two people leaving, I had to handle all of the responsibilities both workers had.  I went from working 35-40 hours a week to 50-60 hours with no benefits either since I was an intern.  While the IT people were friendly, I was very unhappy with my job and was unable to be happy when interacting with others.  I would thinking about asking women out on a date but at the same time, I was afraid to talk to women because I wasn't sure how much longer I will be able to keep this job since I was feeling burned out and miserable.  

Two months after the two IT people quit, the person in charge of IT said the company was not doing very well financially and not only were full time employees no longer eligible for overtime pay, there will be a hiring freeze, meaning I cannot be hired full time and the two people who left will not be replaced.  About a couple of weeks later though, This same boss made an announcement one of the IT workers, who was working as a contractor was being hired full time.  Once I found this out, I really started to seriously think about quitting and I lost focus of my work from stressing myself out so much.  

There was an incident one day where I forgot to back up data from a user's computer in a specific location and ended up wiping the data without backing it up by accident.  While everyone was willing to forgive my mistake and they were able to recover the lost data, I just felt like the time was right for me to consider leaving.  I was miserable, tired, and felt physically sick.  My body would constantly ache and I would get headaches often.  

 I talked to my supervisors, who were supportive and were willing to let me work until I can find a new position.   In December of 2008, I agreed on a 3 month contract position to work somewhere else and signed off on the paperwork.  At the time, I was so desperate to leave, I took the first job offered to me.  I gave my bosses a two week notice where I would leave at the end of the year and would start my new job at the beginning of the new year. 

On my last week though, the recruiter who setup this job opportunity said the contract job is starting one week late.  I figured I would get a week to relax before I start my next job so I was fine with it.  Then he calls me a few days later saying the jobs been postponed another week. Then an additional week goes by where the recruiter now tells me there's no longer a start date scheduled.  So in other words, I just left my previous job for no job at all.  My bosses did ask for me to stay in contact with them in case the contract job does not work out but I was so upset with having to leave and how burned out I was I did not stay in contact with them.  Instead of being professional and staying in contact, I let it become personal and instead of staying in contact, I wanted to prove everyone I was deserving of a full time position and obtained another IT certification.  Right after I obtained my next certification, the recruiter called me saying if I'm still available, the job starts next week and it's now a 6 month contract job.  Since I was out of work, I said okay and started this new position.

I was stressed out over this job for completely different reasons than my previous job. In this situation, every one was a contractor brought in for a project where all of the users' computers are being migrated to new ones.  The problem was there was very little planning done to implement the project.  Initially, there was me and one other contractor brought in but since the company did not even have the computers to deploy yet, we did not get to do much of anything for the first couple of weeks.  The process of migrating the computers was difficult for several reasons.  The first one being software was being tested as the computers are supposed to be migrating so there would be days where we could migrate a sizeable amount of computers but there would be days where we cannot do anything at all.  We also had no information as to what software users already have so we had to physically take a look at every computer and make notes of any extra programs that may need to be re-installed on the new computers.  The other issue was since there was no planning done,  everyone had different methods for migrating users' computers and some migrations didn't go so well while others were smooth.  

Migrating computers was one of my responsibilities in my previous job, so I was able to handle migrations fine.  The problem was word spread of bad migrations and a lot of people were afraid of getting their computers replaced.  We basically became used car salesman trying to sell them on a computer that may be better for them but at the same time we could not guarantee the migration would not go so well.

A couple of months into this project, I met a woman, who I will call Ya working on one of the floors who was very attractive.  I was so relaxed since I knew I was doing a good job at migrating the computers in the area, I started talking to her and asked her out to lunch, to which she said yes.  At the age of 22, I was finally about to go on my first date.  She wanted to eat chicken so we went to Popeye's for lunch.  At first, I got the feeling the was interested me as we talked but then she made a statement that caught my attention.  While we were talking she said she was ""looking for a man to treat her like a queen and buy her things.""  When I heard that, I started thinking she may only be interested in be because she thinks I'm making a lot of money so I felt uncomfortable making any serious moves toward her.  I did not tell my family anything about this girl since I was afraid they will try to convince me to break up with her.

For the second date, she wanted me to go with her to olive garden along with her father and her two sisters.  I was a little nervous because I thought it was so soon to meet her family but I wasn't about to turn down a date either.  I arrived at the train stop where we were supposed to meet but she's not there.  After waiting about 10 minutes past the meetup time, I called her but she does not respond.  I'm starting to think I'm being stood up but at the same time, I don't wanna risk missing out on a date.  She eventually shows up about 30 minutes past her meetup time and we end up heading to olive garden.  

I really don't feel comfortable making any moves on her at this point since her family's there with her so we talk but I really don't say much since there was no privacy.  We all have a seat, enjoy the meal but then the bill comes in.  While I was talking to Ya, one of sisters asks me to pay for her since she forgot to bring money.  I look at my money and realize I'm gonna be broke if I pay for her as well as for myself and Ya but Ya says ""just pay it"", which got me a little upset but I kept my mouth shut.  

A few days later, I meet Ya for lunch and then she asks me for $50 to buy a phone for her sister.  It was around this time that we were told the project is going to end a month early so the original 3 month project that turned into a 6 month project is now down to 4.  I told  her I have to be careful financially since I'm gonna have to find a new job soon and she got upset and we didn't talk much the rest of the break.  This is when I start thinking I may have to stop talking to her.

A few days later we went on another date on the weekend, which was on her birthday.  Since I'm still thinking about maybe leaving her, I don't feel comfortable trying to kiss her and I'm trying to keep my distance.  Thankfully, one of her family members calls her saying they have to meet her about something.  She probably asked one of her relatives to call her to get out of the date with me but at the time, I didn't have a big problem with it.  

The following Monday, she calls me asking to meet for lunch, which I agreed to.  This time, she asks me for $200 to help pay the rent.   This is after I told her about my job situation the previous week.  This time I spoke a little louder and said no.  We both sit down and eat lunch but are not talking to each other.  She takes out her phone and talks to someone in Spanish with an attitude.  I never learned Spanish growing up so I don't understand what she's saying but I figured it was about me.  I decided to step out a minute and talk to my second cousin, Mi for a few minutes.  When I turn around, I see Ya storm off.  I step back in my seat, put my feet up, and finish eating my food thinking to myself ""thank god this is about to end."" 

After lunch, I called her saying we have to meet after work.  It was time to break up with her and I didn't wanna wait any longer.  She said she's staying at work late.  I asked ""how about tomorrow?"" She says she's busy.  ""how about this weekend?"" she's going out with her sisters.  I'm not about to let this last any longer so I decide to send her an email letting her know how I feel.  I told her I believe she only went out with me because she thought I would spend all my money on her and she never cared about how I feel and she never cared about me being happy.  She replied back saying ""fine"".  I admit email is a bad way to break up with someone and I haven't done it since but I just felt like had to end this as soon as possible. 

A few days after this happened, I sent a joke email to one of the contractors pretending to be a user unhappy about the migration.  He thought it was funny to send it to our boss via email who was rarely in the office.  The boss didn't find it funny and I ended up being let go.  The contractor felt bad about it but I told him I made the mistake and did the best I can to let him know he did nothing wrong.

At this point, it's around September of 2009 and II was able to save a lot of money where I could give myself time to learn new IT skills and this time be able to be patient and only consider good job opportunities.  While I had trouble finding full time work, I did get calls for temp IT jobs, which allowed me to continue being patient and chip in with the rent.  Since I wasn't working full time though, I did not feel comfortable going out trying to make new friends and trying to find a new girlfriend.  

Things got worse about this time because Cn's son, Cs lost his apartment because he got involved which drugs, ended up quitting his job so he can have more time getting high, and had to move in with us.  With my grand father passing away a few years ago, there was me, my two aunts, one of my first cousins, and his son, Mi.  Because Cs was not only into drugs, he wasn't looking for work and not spending time with his son, nobody got along with him and everyone would argue more than ever.

About a year and a half later, I was able to get a new IT job, which I currently still have today.  At the time I was offered the position, I was told I would be a contractor for 3 months and then get converted to full time.  I ended up working as a contractor for over a year until I got converted to working full time.  Right at the start I felt miserable at the job for multiple reasons.

The first one being I was not allowed to work on my own at first.  One of my bosses and co workers would try to tell me what to say and what to do even though I've had previous IT jobs before.  I lost my confidence immediately since I wasn't allowed to be myself. Another reason I've always felt uncomfortable is I don't feel like the people there are good people.  They've made racist jokes so many times, They've said horrible things about people behind their backs,  and they take humor in other people's misfortunes.  I remember a couple of months ago, there was a video of a tiger killing a woman and they were all joking and laughing about it.  

During the time I was contractor, I felt the same way I felt in previous jobs, where I can't go out and make new friends or go out with women since I'm not a full time employee and I can be fired at any time.  When I wasn't working, I would self-study at home for about 2-3 hours a night trying to teach myself new computer skills still hoping I can get an IT job I would be happy with.  Because I would push myself so hard, I would feel sick and tired almost every day just like I did at my first job.

I was also miserable because users would always have attitudes with me when they're having computer problems and when the solution is not a quick fix.  I thought about quitting every day but couldn't because I needed the money to take care of myself.  Eventually it got to a point which I was willing to quit and just give up on working period.   One week, I sent two emails before I went to work.  One of them was to a recruiter for a new job and the other one was to my bosses listing how many hours I worked the previous week.  What happened was I got the email subject mixed up between both emails so my bosses saw I was at least considering quitting.  I was so frustrated at this point, I was hoping for them to fire me.

A couple of days went by, and one of my bosses made me an offer to work full time, which I accepted since the recruiter I was speaking to never responded to my voice mail or email.  My feeling was if this job allows me to get my own apartment and move away from my relatives, I'll deal with it.  Once I told my family I', working full time, One of my uncles named De said he can help me get into a co-op apartment later on this year.  The problem was the co-op is under one of my aunts' names and they would have to be okay with my taking over the apartment.  It was being rented out to help pay the bills.  Later on in the year, I was able to move in and at the time, I felt the day I moved in was the greatest day of my life.  I finally started to feel somewhat confident in myself and at the age of 26, I was finally ready to start having a social life or so I thought.

I joined multiple meetup groups with the main group focused on people with social anxiety.  I identified myself with this group since I've become a very shy person and have a difficult time opening myself to others.  For about 8 or 9 months, I would attend at least 1 or 2 meetups per week.  There were a couple of women I was able to get dates with but neither one seemed very comfortable with me.

The first woman I only went out with once.  We met up at a bowling alley because she said she likes bowling.  We start talking for a little while but as time goes on, she's paying more and more attention to her phone instead of starting a conversation with me.  I decide to ask her if she wants to go somewhere to get something to eat to see if she's interested or not and she says no.  We finished bowling and went our separate ways.  I made no attempt to kiss her since she seemed to have no interest in me.

The next person I met was someone I was very interested in.  She liked video games just like me and we got along well on the first date.  I was afraid of messing up the date so I made no attempt to kiss her.  On the second date, I felt more comfortable and kissed her on the cheek and she seemed happy.  At this point, I'm starting to feel confident about myself and thinking the next date I'll be able to kiss her on the lips.  The third date seems to be going well but when I went to kiss her on the lips at the end of the date, she turned and gave me her cheek to kiss instead.  At this point, I'm thinking I waited too long and I screwed things up.

At this point, I'm starting to get the feeling she's started to lose interest in me as a boyfriend so I ask her to out on a date to celebrate new years.  She respond back saying she's not ready to be in a relationship and she has a lot of things going on.  I felt pretty miserable at this point, thinking I got my hopes up only to get disappointed again.

I had a lot of trouble getting along with people with in the meetup group.  The problem was because I had isolated myself from people for so long, I had no clue how to talk to people and felt very uncomfortable.  Either I would approach someone or somebody would approach me, we would talk for a couple of minutes, and then that person would leave to talk to either someone they know or someone knew.  This behavior occurred over and over again at every meetup and over time, I started to lose confidence in myself over time.  It also did not help that I felt the meetup organizer of the group was not very respectful at times.  

The first time was when I suggested an idea for people who are single to meet together on valentines day sand he said it's not a good idea.  The feeling I got was that he just brushed off my idea without considering how I feel.  The second time was when someone created a meetup and asking if other people could join her.  The organizer replied to the email so everyone could see it where he told her ""don't beg for people to show up.""  The final time was when he sent an email to everyone saying people should learn to love and all people who become hateful become serial killers.  This got me really upset because I've become very upset with people but I never want to hurt anyone else.

After I stopped attending the meetups, I decided to try online dating to see if I can find someone that way.  There were very few women who responded to me and the ones who did would stop responding after a couple of messages and I was unable to get any dates. I gave up online dating about a few months later I still had some confidence in myself since while I did not get to kiss any women, I was able to go out on dates, which was more progress than I made before.  All the confidence started to go away about last year though when my Uncle De died.

He was the one family member who I felt was a good person.  Even though he did not provide emotional support,  he did help me get the apartment I live in today and he did try to help other people in the community.  When I told Re, about the news he replied ""Oh. I read something about that on Facebook.""  This got me very upset because he saw one of my relatives may have passed away and he couldn't even ask me how I'm doing.  Even one of my bosses said he's sorry for my loss."" A few days later I asked him if he'll stop by for the viewing hoping to get some type of emotional support from him but he said he can't make it.  I said ok and I have not received any texts from him ever since.  I was also starting to get depressed since online dating wasn't working out and neither was speed dating.  I tried speed dating events to get more experience talking to women but the events were at bars where it was very hard to talk to someone.  I also did not feel comfortable talking since we only had a few minutes to talk to each woman and it takes time for me to open up around someone.  

What made things worse was one of my co workers got married as well.  So currently, all of my co workers and bosses are married while I'm still single and living alone.  This year has been the toughest year of my life by far.  While nothing terrible happened in the first half of the year, nothing good happened to give me hope to believe I have a future but I still kept trying to change things.  I gave online dating another try and I was able to meet one person in the spring, but we did not get along very well at all.  After a couple of dates, I broke up with her and I got very upset with myself for forcing myself into another bad situation.  

This past September was when I really started going downhill emotionally.  For the entire summer, I was either showing up early or staying late for work every day.  It's bad enough I hate being there because of how I'm treated by many people but then I would have to work an extra hour or two every day and because I did not have any friends, a girlfriend, or any family members to go to for support, I had to deal with everything on my own and all the anger just made me feel more and more miserable.  I was always tired, always had headaches, and when I would get really angry, different parts of my body would start shaking and it still happens on occasion.  I was at the point where I was really thinking of killing myself so when I got really upset one day,  I called my father and told him I don't wanna live anymore.

I told him I'm tired of lonely, I'm tired of trying to open myself up only to be treated badly, I hate my job, and I just feel like I can never change anything for the better.  He told me that nobody ever treats me bad and it's all in my head, which made me very upset.  Since I never told him specific examples of what's happened to me, I felt like he shouldn't tell me I'm wrong when I haven't told him anything that's happened.  After arguing with him for a few minutes, I hung up the phone and went back to work.

During this time, he was telling all my relatives about what happened, when I would try and talk to them about how I feel, they would tell me I'm wrong for feeling the way I do.  I felt like I was talking to a wall every time I talked to them.  A few days after I initially called my father,  He called me suggesting I go to therapy to get medication.  I did not want to get involved with drugs in any way and I told him I'm gonna figure out how to change things on my own.  

I decided to join meetup groups involving activities where I'm forced to interact with other.  I thought this would help me break out of my shell.  I started taking dancing classes thinking I would develop confidence with women.  The problem was by confidence level was very low.  For the first dance lesson, I was very nervous and I was tight instead of loose when trying to learn how to dance.  When the dance lesson was over and the dance party, I asked two women to dance with me and both declined.  I figured since this was my first time at the place it was no big deal and I can try again next time.

The following week, I attended a different dance meetup but it was located at a bar instead of a dance studio like the previous meetup.  There was very little room to dance so everyone was bumping into each other and I had no confidence I could do anything right.  Right after the lesson was over, I left and went home.

Later on in the week, I went to the second dance lesson at the dance studio.  This experience was much worse than the first one.  When the lesson was about to start, all of the women were asked to find a partner and before I can ask someone, all of the women rushed to find someone else and I was alone without a dance partner.  I was depressed for the entire lesson and once it was over, I went home regretting going out at all.  I may have called the suicide hotline but I don't remember for sure.      

I'm still trying to force myself to meet women so the following day, I sign up for a singles cruise event taking place two days after the dance lesson.  I arrive at the boat and try to talk to two different women separately with both of them ending the conversation after talking for about a minute.  As soon as the second woman walked away from me, she walked to talk to a guy right in front of me.  I don't think she was doing it to make me feel bad or jealous but I still felt miserable.  For the rest of the 4 hour cruise, I alternated between looking out the window and putting my head down so I don't see everyone else enjoying themselves while I feel miserable.

When the cruise was over,  I was the most depressed I ever been and wanted to die.  I didn't want to go home but I had nowhere else to go.  I called one of my aunts, Cn to tell her how I feel and that I was thinking the only way I can get a woman to spend time with me is to see a prostitute.  She's telling me I'm not lonely and I have the family even though I have to remind her what's happened over the years and how everyone is like.  

I felt so miserable, I had to use a vacation day since I was not able to handle going to work.  One of my relatives called me and suggested I go to a gym, which would help me feel better about myself.  I started going three weeks ago and have been going every day except for Fridays.  What happened tonight was I went to the basement to wash clothes where I was alone with my thoughts and I started thinking about how lonely I am again.  I started thinking about my future and how I may never be happy.

I'm almost 30 years old, I've never had a serious relationship, never had sex and just feel like because of my lack of experience with women it will be impossible to ever have a good relationship.  I believe most women would feel concerned about being involved with someone my age who has so little/no experience with other women.  I want to get married and have some kids someday but I just cannot see that ever happening.  I also have a dead end job with no way out.  I'm tired of being lonely but no matter how hard I try to learn from my mistakes and change things for the better, I fail over and over again and end up being more miserable than before.  I hate myself and I hate my life for what I've let it become.

I'm tired of failing but at the same time, nobody's going to change anything for me either.  I don't wanna live like this anymore but I don't wanna kill myself.  I just wish there was a way for me to see into the future so I know for sure nothing good will ever happen and I can go through with killing myself.

I've spent the past 4 hours typing everything so if there's any spelling mistakes or there's some things that don't make sense, I apologize.

59t1zz,26,2016-10-28,Losing weight in college?,pyrophospo,xxfitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/59t1zz/losing_weight_in_college/,"Hi everybody! I'm in my senior year of college and I'm a biology major on the premed track (pending response from med schools...)

I'm 5'7, and I currently weigh 166 pounds, which is overweight according to my BMI. My body goal is Beyoncé (also 5'7, but she weighs 137lbs). So, basically, I want to lose 30lbs. I had high hopes coming on to campus because I would be more in control of my day and I would have access to the gym. I started working out (pink gloves boxing class) and eating healthier (starting slow) but a few weeks ago, everything kind of fell apart. 

My mother is getting chemotherapy, and as the only child, I have to leave campus on weekends to drive her and provide after-care, so that only leaves me with Mon-Wed to exercise. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, I have classes from 10AM - 6PM, not including time to study for midterms. I'm in a research lab from 9AM to 7PM on Wednesdays, and I have an internship on Mondays from 10-1. On top of this, I work a minimum of 8 hrs per week. 

I've made excuses for the past two years as the number on the scale kept climbing, but I'm done with that and I want to make real efforts to change, even if starting small. It's hard to keep a good diet because my college only offers ""all-you-can-eat"" plans, which prevent me from getting breakfast before class - not to mention, the food is all carbs (no protein, salad bar is soggy and overripe). 

With all that being said, Beyoncé has the same 24 hours that I do, and I know it's possible for me to at least cut down a pound per week. Do you guys have any advice for lifestyle changes I could make on campus so I can reach my goal?

TLDR; College student on campus, trying to balance stress and poor food options in an attempt to reach a weight loss goal of 30 lbs. 

Thanks so much! You guys are AWESOME! "
59ti3g,0,2016-10-28,Looking for example contracts,xjeroen,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/59ti3g/looking_for_example_contracts/,"Hi there r/lawschool !

I'm computer science student in my graduating internship and I'm doing research into automated Contract Analysis. I am writing a program for analyzing contracts but to train the program I need a whole bunch of example contracts.

Therefore my question is, does anyone know where I could find such contracts? I've stumbled upon [Onecle](http://www.onecle.com/) and [ContractStandards](https://www.contractstandards.com/) although the latter only gives templates.  I'm hoping someone will be able to direct me to more sites like Onecle.

The contracts I'm looking for are mainly the following:

* Empoyment Contracts
* Severance Agreements
* Supplier Agreements
* Lease Contracts
* Construction Contracts

Anything is welcome but those are the main types I'm looking for.

In any case, thank you for your time!"
59tsfd,3,2016-10-28,Visa to USA,Sentient64,Kuwait,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kuwait/comments/59tsfd/visa_to_usa/,"I'm applying to Facebook and Twitter internships and in the application forms they require the applications to be legally allowed to work in the US. In the Facebook application that I already submitted, I said that I'm legally allowed to work there. Currently filling out the Twitter forms and I've hesitated to say the same.

I haven't gotten any visa to the US before. I don't know where to go and what to do to get it or how long it would take.

Could someone offer some insight about this whole visa thing? I'm completely lost.

I have submitted an application both to Google and Apple for internships as well, but neither have asked this in their forms. I had a Google employee contact and according to him, Google will take care of literally everything for me if they want me to do the on-site interview in their office. Meaning they'll pay for plane tickets, get me from the airport to their office, and provide anything I need. They didn't mention anything about a visa or something.

Again, I really don't know anything about visas. I've only ever been once to Dubai and twice to Makkah and once to Egypt for a programming contest. All those times, the people I'm travelling with covered the plans and directions and all that."
59tvbu,2,2016-10-28,Wanting to move to Boise but bf is worried,BearhoundSoul,Boise_Idaho,https://www.reddit.com/r/Boise_Idaho/comments/59tvbu/wanting_to_move_to_boise_but_bf_is_worried/,"My family moved to Boise in April and I wanted to go but my boyfriend didn't feel ready so I stayed in Florida with him. I told him from the start I intended to leave Florida and go to Boise in a year's time, so he should get ready before then. 

Well he has concerns about the area the closer the day draws near that we're due to leave, so I wanted to ask you locals some questions to either put his mind at ease or avoid making a big mistake. 

My family says the job market is great out there even for people who don't have a degree. I have my AA and I want to get a pharmacy tech certification before I go out there. My bf already has his certification but he's never used it because he decided that he hated it while he was doing his internship. He cleans floors with fancy equipment and it pays good, and he's not sure he could get a job with similar pay out there very easily ($15/hr). 

He is also concerned about the cost of living out there. My family says they buy locally and get a lot of their food for cheap, so the cost of living in Florida is the same as in Boise. If I were to go out there with a pharmacy tech certification and about $5000 saved in reserve, will we be able to get an apartment or rent a house easily and quickly so we don't have to move in with my parents first? 

We both want land as well, about 20 acres. How hard is it to get land outside of the Boise area? We're outdoorsy and like to hike and camp and all that.

Lastly he is a much more social creature than me, so he'll be looking for friends. We're both 25. I know it's a college town but I thought I'd ask if it would be difficult to find a social circle out there. 

Thanks for any help, I appreciate it!"
59v5ws,0,2016-10-28,Quick survey: Tutoring in Gwinnett,atlantaLOL2,Gwinnett,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gwinnett/comments/59v5ws/quick_survey_tutoring_in_gwinnett/,"I recently moved to the Lilburn/Norcross for an engineering internship in the Fall.  I really enjoy learning about math and physics and other things, in general. I find tutoring very fulfilling and am pursuing volunteer tutoring. I can tutor elementary students in math, but my main strengths are high school math and physics programs, especially Calculus, Electromagnetic physics and beyond. 

I am interested in knowing if there are people in the Gwinnett area interested in tutoring services.  In addition,  I could also tutor to teach students interested in going above and beyond their current curriculum: for instance, if a student is studying Pre-Calculus, I can tutor him in Calculus to prepare for their next semester, year, or freshman year of college. I can also tutor college students in algebra-based and calculus-based physics.  

I kindly ask for a quick response whether this is something you/your parent/your child is interested in. Also, would you prefer group/private tutoring, what are you willing to pay, if you'd rather have group volunteer tutoring, etc. Thank you very much! 

TLDR: Interested in tutoring? Comment! "

Notable Moments|
:-
**January 11, 1981** - After losing to the Cowboys in all but 3 games from 1967–79, the Eagles finished first in the NFC East in 1980 due to tie-breaking procedures and thus claimed the number one overall seed. It was also called the ""Blue Jersey Game"", on the account that the Eagles, having the choice as the home team, made the Cowboys wear their seemingly cursed blue jerseys (a stigma that dated back to Super Bowl V). Eagles defeated the Cowboys 20-7.|
**1987 Season** - With many of the Cowboys players crossing the picket line during the strike, Dallas humiliated the replacement-laden Eagles 41-22. Buddy Ryan accused Tom Landry of running up the score, and Ryan had his heart set on revenge. With little time remaining and the Eagles up by ten, Randall Cunningham faked a kneel down and tossed a long pass into the end zone, resulting in a pass interference call. With the Eagles at the one, a final touchdown sealed the revenge for the Eagles, 37-20.|
**1991 Season** - The Eagles began the 1991 season by pounding the Cowboys 24-0 in Texas Stadium in Week 3. Riding a three-game winning streak, Dallas entered Veterans Stadium in Week 16 with a chance at a playoff berth, their first since 1985. The Cowboys benefited from Eagles QB Randall Cunningham being injured, and rode a Kelvin Martin punt return for a touchdown to a 25-13 victory. The loss jolted the Eagles from the playoff picture.|
**December 28, 2008** - The Eagles and Cowboys faced off in Philadelphia with a wild card playoff berth on the line. The winner would claim the sixth and final wild card spot in the NFC, and the loser would be eliminated from playoff contention. This situation was brought about by losses earlier in the day by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Chicago Bears, which kept the Eagles playoff hopes alive. The Eagles did not squander the opportunity, and took a 27-3 halftime lead on their way to a 44-6 blowout of the Cowboys. It was Terrell Owens' last game as a Cowboy. The Eagles went all the way to the NFC Championship before losing to the Arizona Cardinals.|
**January 3, 2010** - The Cowboys (10-5) hosted their regular season finale against the Philadelphia Eagles (11-4) in a regular season-sealing claim for the NFC East crown. The Cowboys would win the day, shutting out the Eagles, 24-0. With the victory, the Cowboys would once again reclaim first place in their division and improve to 11–5 to top off their regular season. Despite the loss, the Eagles claimed the #6 seed in the NFC, while the Cowboys claimed the #3 seed, setting the stage for a rematch in the first round of the playoffs. For the third time that year, the Cowboys defeated the Eagles, with a final score of 34-14. The Cowboys and Eagles combined to set an NFL record for the most penalty yards in a playoff game, ever. The two teams were penalized 23 times for 228 yards. With the win, not only did the Cowboys improve to 12–5, they finally won their first postseason game since 1996. This was the last game with the Eagles for QB Donovan McNabb.|
**December 29, 2013** - The Eagles and Cowboys faced off in Dallas for the de facto NFC East Championship. The winner would thus claim the sixth and final playoff spot in the NFC, and the loser would be eliminated from playoff contention. The Eagles did not squander the opportunity, as they won 24-22. Brandon Boykin intercepted a pass by backup quarterback Kyle Orton to Miles Austin with 1:43 remaining to seal the victory.|

Cowboys|
:---|
RB **Ezekiel Elliott** leads the NFL with 703 rushing yards. He has rushed for at least 130 yards in four consecutive games, the first rookie in NFL history to accomplish the feat. With 130 rushing yards against the Eagles on Sunday night, Elliott would become just the seventh player in NFL history to rush for at least 130 yards in five consecutive games.|
RB **Ezekiel Elliot**'s 703 rushing yards, in six games this season, gives him the second-most rushing yards in a player’s first six career games.  He is second to HoF RB **Eric Dickerson** who totaled 787 rushing yards during his first 6 games with the Rams in 1983.|
QB **Dak Prescott** passed for 247 yards and three touchdowns and RB **Ezekiel Elliot** rushed for 157 yards in the Cowboys' win over the Packers in Week 6. Both of those totals were all-time highs by a rookie at Lambeau Field. Elliott's rushing-yards total was the third highest by a visiting rookie at Lambeau Field, behind only RB **Todd Gurley** (159 in 2015) and RB **Cadillac Williams** (158 in 2005).|
QB **Dak Prescott** currently maintains a 103.9 quarterback rating through six games.  It is good enough to give him the fifth best rating in the NFL. Prescott has a passer rating of at least 100 in five straight games, all wins.|
The **Cowboys' Defense** ranks 7th in scoring defense allowing just 17.8 points per game. Dallas has not allowed more than 17 points in a game since Week 2.|
The **Cowboys' Defense** forced four turnovers against Packers and need two to match last season's NFL-worst total (11).|

Milestones|
:---|
TE **Brent Celek** (4,792) needs 208 more yards to reach 5000 career receiving yards.|
RB **Darren Sproles** (18,386) is now 9th on the NFL's All-Time All-Purpose Yards list.  He can move into 8th place with 71 more yards, passing RB **LaDainian Tomlinson** (18,456)|
RB **Darren Sproles** (490) is 10 receptions away from collecting 500 career receptions. Sproles is also 2 touchdowns away from 60 total career touchdowns.|
RB **Ryan Mathews** (4,862) is 138 yards from getting 5,000 career rushing yards.|
OLB **Connor Barwin** (27.5) can move into 15th place on the Eagles All-Time Sack List with 1.5 more sacks, passing DT **Jerome Brown** (29.5).  He is also 2.5 sacks away from reaching 50 career sacks!|
QB **Carson Wentz** (118) needs 44 more passing completions to pass QB **Nick Foles** (161) for most completions by an Eagles Rookie.|
QB **Carson Wentz** (1,325) needs 376 passing yards to pass QB **John Reaves** (1,508) and QB **Nick Foles** (1,699) for most passing yards by an Eagles Rookie.|
QB **Carson Wentz** (8) is currently tied with QB **Donovan McNabb** (8) for most passing touchdowns by an Eagles Rookie.  One more touchdown will give him sole possession of the #1 spot.|
TE **Jason Witten** (1,041) is currently 10th on the NFL's All-Time Receptions list and can move into 9th place with 15 more receptions.  However, two active players are in front of him: WR **Andre Johnson** (9th - 1,062) and WR **Larry Fitzgerald** (8th - 1,064).|
TE **Jason Witten** (203) is set to break DE **Ed ""Too Tall"" Jones'** (203) franchise record with his 204th career start for the Cowboys. Witten (153) is also set to tie LB **Lee Roy Jordan** (154) for most consecutive starts at 154.| 
TE **Jason Witten** (11,489) is currently #2 on the Cowboy's All-Time Receiving Yards list and needs 416 more yards to take the #1 position away from WR **Michael Irvin** (11,904).|
WR **Dez Bryant** (5,975) is only 25 yards from reaching 6,000 career receiving yards.|
QB **Dak Prescott** (7) is three touchdowns shy of beating QB **Troy Aikman**'s (9) rookie club record for most passing touchdowns by a rookie QB.|



Matchups to Watch|
:|
**Eagles S Malcolm Jenkins vs. Cowboys WR Cole Beasley**|
In Bryant's absence, Beasley has been the Cowboys' No. 1 threat. He leads the team with 33 receptions, 309 yards and three touchdowns. And he does his work out of the slot. In the Eagles' overtime win last year he had nine catches for 112 yards. Jenkins is expected to move up into the slot corner spot from his normal safety position because of the season-ending injury to slot corner Ron Brooks. Jenkins came into the league as a corner and has played in the slot before, so this isn't a drastic move. It will be an interesting match-up to watch as the game progresses, however.|
**Eagles LB Nigel Bradham vs. Cowboys TE Jason Witten:**|
There is nothing like a good tight end to help out a young quarterback and that's what the perennial All-Pro Witten has done for Dak Prescott. Bradham has been excellent against tight ends for the Eagles all season. Minnesota's Kyke Rudolph caught five passes for 55 yards last Sunday, but really wasn't a key in the game. Bradham has basically shut down every other tight end he's faced this year. But Witten is a whole kind of different. If Bradham can take him out of the game it could make a big difference in the outcome.|
**Eagles Pass Rush vs. Cowboys Offensive Line**|
It's been pretty simple this season. When the Eagles have gotten a good pass rush the defense has been able to dominate, see Vikings, Minnesota. When the pass rush has been nullified, the defense has struggled, see Redskins, Washington. This week will be a huge test. The individual matchups include Brandon Graham, who is playing very well for the Eagles against right tackle Doug Free. Fletcher Cox likely drawing a double team of G Ronald Leary and C Travis Frederick, and Connor Barwin against maybe the best left tackle in the game, Tyron Smith.|
**Eagles LB Jordan Hicks vs. Cowboys RB Ezekiel Elliot**|
The league's leading rusher, Ezekiel Elliott, has rushed for at least 134 yards in each of the last four games. For the season, the No. 4 overall pick has 703 yards, at 5.1 yards per carry, and five touchdowns. Jordan Hicks had two of his best games as a rookie against the Cowboys in 2015. He recorded his first-career sack in the Week 2 matchup. Quarterback Tony Romo was injured on the play, which altered the future of the franchise as well as the State of the NFC East. In the rematch in Dallas, Hicks scored his first-career touchdown on a pick-six. He also incurred the season-ending pectoral injury in that game. The Cowboys' mission is to control the clock with the run game, and take pressure off of quarterback Dak Prescott. Limiting Elliott's impact will go a long way toward winning this game for the Eagles.|"

I'm a senior graduating in May of 2017 and have recently been offered a Spring internship from Clifton Larson Allen in Dallas. 

The deadline to accept the internship is on October 31st, and while I currently have 5 other second interviews from various firms, there is one particular firm (Chapman Hext) that has offered me a second interview for next week.

I am afraid that by holding out for Chapman Hext or the other firms I risk losing a top 10 firm's internship (for both tax and audit) which I understand would make me very marketable. However, if I accept the internship from CLA I would be closing myself off from the possibility of working at Chapman (where I enjoyed the atmosphere, potential experience with broad financial services, flexibility with scheduling/ hours, and highly probably full-time offer upon graduation).

It's worth mentioning that I haven't yet had an office visit to CLA, and that makes the decision significantly more complex for me.

Any advice will be greatly appreciated!"

Det är då CTH och KTH som intresserar mig mest. 

""Tech"" jobben finns ju i Stockholm så jag undrar om man har en fördel om man kommer med en examen från KTH? Utbildningen är som jag förstått det likvärdig på både skolorna. 

Jag föredrar CTH då det blir ganska mycket lättare med bostad i Göteborg än i Stockholm. Jag bor inte i någon utav städerna så jag måste flytta i båda fall. 

Har jag samma chanser till att få jobb på t.ex Spotify i Stockholm om jag har en examen från CTH istället för KTH? Kan tänka mig att det blir mycket lättare med internships osv hos stockholmsföretagen om man går på KTH då man redan har bostad i Stockholm?"

What are they looking for is there something I can do during the school year that looks impressive for them? I would probably work this whole summer at the Apple Store and depending on whether or not I get an internship the next summer. 
59xb4i,6,2016-10-28,I [21M] have been with my GF [21F] for three years of college and she decided to end our relationship last week out of nowhere. Help please!,Thogarf,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/59xb4i/i_21m_have_been_with_my_gf_21f_for_three_years_of/,"We've been relatively happy together for a full three years of college, living apart for the past three of them and then together for our current senior year (in separate single rooms but sleeping together). The other girls in our apartment suite (all 21F) are all Social Work majors just like her and all have their different internships that they go to. 

All of last week there were no signs of any major issue, even in superanalytical retrospect, she still spent much time with me, showed genuine care and love, and genuine enjoyment with being around me. On Friday she had no classes, spent one hour in the morning doing some homework and then went to her room for the rest of the day to cry and think about her life, as she put it, roughly when I went out to go to my classes and commitments that day (All of this made known to me after the fact). 

As soon as come in, I see her crying in her bed and she comes to talk to me, basically explaining that she's thought about, thinks we're incompatible and so the relationship is over. There was no discussion, apart from a tear-filled emotional back and forth, there was no previous warning, and there was no chance given to improve on the issues she brought up. 

At the end of this discussion we somehow ""agree"" to spend some time separated and reconvene in the next week to see how we feel, before a big test I had coming up. We go to sleep that night separately and all's fine. Wake up the next morning and I just check to make sure she's alright after which she tells me that she didn't actually want to give me a chance and that the relationship was just over.

This kind of trend continues till Wednesday of this week when I decide i'm just done trying to keep pushing because I have things to do, and we just officially break it off. 

The problem i'm having is with her friends and with her. When she would talk to me after that Friday, we would be able to have a good productive conversation, and often would come up with a solid plan to work through some of these issues. The next day she would get inside of her own head or talk to her girlfriends and then completely turn 180 on me and call it off again, hence how this lasted until Wednesday. Basically, in the three years that I knew her, I got to know her very well and to this day she admits that, and I know that her behavior is nothing like what she's doing now at all. It literally feels like she has been mind controlled and is being forced to do something against her will. Now at this point she won't even talk to me, to the point where I can say a decent amount of reasonable stuff and she just says ""I told you not to speak to me about this, I suggest you drop it,"" while last week she was as close to me as she ever was and was so comfortable to me.

I mentioned her friends because I know that they've been in her ear every step of the way, and then when I asked them to speak to me about the situation they ""didn't want to get involved in her and I's relationship because it's not their business,""... despite already doing that. More so, they are 100% the type to make mountains out of mole hills and socially alienate anyone they don't like. They managed to lose 11 of their friends that they were so super close with last year by the end of the year, and have already exiled one of the other girls living with us who was supposed to be even closer. Now i'm just next in line, and my now-ex is none the wiser.

I think why i'm posting is to seek understanding of what's properly going on, and what my options are. To me, I know that if she got out of her funk, she would see this is a mistake and turn her decision around, but in believing this i'm setting myself up for failure and a really unhealthy life for the foreseeable future, but at the same time I just can't accept that she, my actual girlfriend, really feels this way. Nothing about it seems right or in line with what she believes or does in any way. 

I am 100% confident that there is not some other person, and there was never any cheating at all on either of our parts. Apart from my occasional apathy towards doing things with her and her friends, we truly had a really decent relationship going on. 

What are my options? How can I go on? Is there any way that I can get her to see what's actually going on and get out of her friends horrible clasps?

TL;DR: Longtime girlfriend with very close relationship ends it out of nowhere last week and clearly doesn't fully have confidence in what she's doing and i'm sure her friends manipulated her to decide this. Help! What are my options?"
59xju7,78,2016-10-28,Me [30M] having issues with my wife [29F] been together for 10 years and have been married for 7 years. Is my marriage over?,HusbandSeekingHelp,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/59xju7/me_30m_having_issues_with_my_wife_29f_been/,"I normally don't put up personal stuff, but looking to the community for some support and apologies for the long rant. My wife and I have been together for 10 years, married for 7 of those. We have 2 beautiful kids together and for the most part have done everything together as a couple or family until the last couple months.

She is about to turn 30 and is starting to go through a ""mid-life crises"". There's a new group of employees going through the company internship program and they are all fresh out of college in their early 20's. She has now attached herself to this crowd and feels she needs to live up the remaining time in her 20's with this group as they will then consider her old once she hits 30. Things have completely changed with her over the last couple months with her wanting to go out multiple times a week for after work drinks and party with this crowd. I of course get left behind to put the kids to bed and look after them these nights.

At first it wasn't an issue, but now it has taken its toll on me. I've approached her about what's going on and she swears she's not cheating on me which I believe and this is just something she needs to get through. What has made it worse though is she continues to push me away and says she needs her time to find out who she is and what she wants. I never thought or got the impression our time spent together or with the kids as a family wasn't fun and enjoyable, so I don't know what to say about this.

What really hurt and has put a strain on my feelings for the relationship now is when she started talking to me about a birthday celebration being put together for some of the people at work and the weekend she decided worked best was our anniversary weekend. She claimed this was the best weekend since it fit in best for all the birthdays and when I mentioned it was our anniversary weekend, all she could say was so. I then said I could get a sitter and we could combine the 2 events to her responding I'm not invited. 

This really broke my heart and I've tried talking to her about it, but I don't think we're getting anywhere on our own. I've mentioned to her we need to go to a marriage counseling and she needs to seek help about some traumatic experiences from her childhood, but she refuses. At this point I'm spending all my time on my kids with school, bought some board games to enjoy with them, and getting into the Halloween spirit to prepare for trick or treating. I find it hard to even have an open conversation with her now as I don't know who this person is.

I really do want to fix this, but what should I do especially since she's not convinced to seek therapy? My plan is to go see a therapist myself to prevent anger and hatred to consume me. I also feel I should go through this next month to allow her to have her big celebration. Once that's out the way, attempt to fix things at that point if she's ready, otherwise I think it's over. Is giving her ""time"" going to hopefully get us to the next step to recovery or will is cause more grief? The last think I want is to split the family, but I don't think it would be healthy for the kids either.

TL;DR

My wife couple months ago started hanging and partying with her younger employees and stays out til late and refuses to spend time with me and the kids citing that she needs to enjoy life and party and this is ruining our family and she refuses to seek help or get couples counselling."

59y6o7,0,2016-10-28,Perhaps Apologize to Rotten,MakeMyselfGreatAgain,ymrealdeal,https://www.reddit.com/r/ymrealdeal/comments/59y6o7/perhaps_apologize_to_rotten/,"I feel like maybe I should apologize to rotten. I have a few blocks that keep an apology from freely flowing, mainly the fact
that when she found something I wrote annoying she had a habit of attacking my virginity and she also did not keep her word when 
she reported me to the badmins.  I mean I must say, though, she was always good at biting insults.

I think our interactions on YM increased the past two years.  We had some state solidarity, and at one point she mentioned in a thread that she would consider hanging out with me, but I was too worried about having someone do like 4 hours of driving to hang out with socially inept me at the time.  She also was going to invite me to some Princeton thing before that, but that was when I self-banned for a month.

Rotten suggested that I should apologize to YM when I first started to pming her under the cool name horcruxnumber9 after riptpshelloym got banned.  (It's a combination of horcrux from HP and the Beatles song.)

&gt; Me: I knew I'd get banned again if I posted. Pls don't report me to the mods. This is really the only forum I post at. If I stay quiet at least I still get to feel like I am part of the community and have a link to you and ird. 

&gt; Rotten: i won't, but i think you should pm the mods and say you're sorry for freaking everyone out and the comment 
about r*p*/prostitution was poorly worded. this place could be good for you if you let it""

At the time, I did not want to do it because I thought it was ridiculous that the comment got blown up so much as to warrant a ban, let alone a permaban. I also did not truly believe that certain mods and YMers would change their minds.  It might have been prudent advice, but I didn't want to do it out of pure expediency, 
making up an apology that I did not truly feel. 

I now realize that maybe I didn't need to apologize, but
I at least could have gone with the second part of rotten's suggestion, saying that my post was unclear, unnecessary, provocative, and made it clear that the various ways people were taking the post definitely were not what I meant.  I did write this on the TPS reddit, but apparently it was too late, and/or never would have been effective anyway.

I think the following quotes might have been where rotten got annoyed with me because I was upset about being banned, and abortion was saying really murderous, offensive things about men, but YM's gender bias kept them from banning her.  

Also, richard was annoying the sh*t out of YM at the time, and I was annoyed with her too.  OnStar ended up making a post about trading richard for me, but mer and others shot it down.  Things have since changed. I'm cool with Richard.  Richard grew on me on TPS and in tinychat. And, I really didn't want anyone truly banned.

&gt; 02-23 20:24:58 Me: abortion should be banned next

&gt; 02-24 01:30:27 Rotten: i like having abortion around shes entertaining and makes lots of shit posts

&gt; 02-24 04:18:19 Me: richard should be banned next

&gt; 02-24 04:20:00 Rotten: yes signed altho its kind of funny reading her posts, like if albert was bitchy as well as quirky


&gt; 02-24 19:51:15 Me: all the lurkers are happy to have your one our side 

&gt; 02-25 16:38:52 Me: fuk richard and fuk ym

&gt; 02-25 16:41:13 Rotten: why fuck ym i love ym. u love ym thats why ur lurking

&gt; 02-25 19:22:06 Me: i think my banning is very unjust and absurd, and i will never apologize to ym

Perhaps I lessened any good feels rotten had towards me at the time. She joked in a thread ""what if i meet azz.""
She also put up a vigorous defense to keep posters with low post counts from being banned. 

&gt; she would definitely never make a post on ym, she would be one of our sweet silent lurkers""

&gt; LIKE IF UR HEART GOES OUT 2 LURKERS!!!

At the time when I began emailing her I had no idea that she reported me the mods. She gave me the same
advice again in our first email exchange.

&gt; There is still some conflict on YM about if/when you should be allowed to return, I really think if you just apologize and admit that some of your posts have been carelessly phrased and easy to misinterpret and then throw in that you have an appointment on April 5th everyone will agree to give you another chance. You just have to show that you're trying.

&gt; Cheers

She gave me advice in another response. This was not the first time she gave me this advice. I don't think I responded to this email, so I never told her that I had been putting programming 
languages on my resumes, and on some I have put select online courses, but I never let her know that I was doing this, so she might have thought I was totally ignoring it.

&gt; You have stuff to put on your resume [[MakeMyselfGreatAgain]], all your programming coursera classes are worth
putting on there and you should pretend your senior project was good even if it sucked, everyone else does lol.  My internship was bullshit I didn't learn anything and I was trained by people who barely graduated high school.

I didn't send her an email again for over a month, in May. She replied to my email, but then I didn't send her a good response, and I knew I didn't sent her the best response at the time. I don't think she liked my response, and I've wondered if the response scared her for some reason.  

She stopped returning my emails until recently (although we had a tinychat interaction during the summer) where she did say she was not scared of me. This was during probably the worst month of the ordeal for me.  It's when IRD and Zippo decided to create the new TPS.

I know a lot of people share the following feelings, and in a thread I made earlier, I said I wasn't really looking for advice in most of my posts on YM, just was reporting on what was happening, wanting to be heard or wanting people to understand.  Most of my emails to rotten were just updates on my situation or explanations.  I didn't mean for her to feel like she had to constantly help me.

In her last email she wrote: 
&gt; You have a lot of ideas that are incredibly frustrating and disagreeable to me, and I can't have a conversation with you without trying to help you or give you advice which takes a lot of energy and isn't how a friendship should work. I really do hope everything improves for you but I also know there is no way
I can possibly help you. I'm really just like out of advice and supportive things to say, you don't seem to want to make any kind of effort to change your mentality and it doesn't seem necessary for me to engage in conversation with you anyway, since you are pretty much using me as a sounding board, I may as well be Wilson the volleyball.

So, maybe I should have listened to rotten's advice, and maybe I should have been more clear on some things and gave myself more time to formulate responses rather than let my anger dictate some of my pms or posts.  Maybe I should have just enjoyed the fact that she was willing to pm me and just rode out the ban.  I'm not sure how I could have made it known that I was not always asking for help in my emails though."
59yb8m,12,2016-10-28,"So I graduated, what now?",iBoughtMyWinRAR,netsecstudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/netsecstudents/comments/59yb8m/so_i_graduated_what_now/,"I graduated in May with BA in a cyber security oriented degree, have participated in two years of CCDC in my region, done CTFs such as NCL, worked as an Infosec Intern at a large company for a summer, and worked as campus IT for a year and a half.  I am proficient in python and assembly.  

I'm not sure where to go from here.  I thought I was doing everything I needed to line up a job out of college.  I've been applying for Security Analyst &amp; similar positions because I was under the impression that this was the entry level job for the industry, but I haven't had a single interview since graduating.

As far as certs I currently have none, which might why I'm not getting through HR.  I'm about to start taking PWK so I can get my OSCP soon.  I understand there are easier certs but I'd like to learn something instead of wasting my time regurgitating information for a CEH or Security+.  I'm just worried that after finishing getting this cert no more doors are going to open up for me than before.  

Should I be shooting for working as a Sys admin or something similar and what would I need to qualify for these positions if so?  I'm really not sure what my best moves would be at this point to start working in infosec.  "
59yd74,2,2016-10-28,Me [30M] having issues with my wife [29F] been together for 10 years and have been married for 7 years. Is my marriage over?,HusbandSeekingHelp,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/59yd74/me_30m_having_issues_with_my_wife_29f_been/,"I normally don't put up personal stuff, but looking to the community for some support and apologies for the long rant. My wife and I have been together for 10 years, married for 7 of those. We have 2 beautiful kids together and for the most part have done everything together as a couple or family until the last couple months.

She is about to turn 30 and is starting to go through a ""mid-life crises"". There's a new group of employees going through the company internship program and they are all fresh out of college in their early 20's. She has now attached herself to this crowd and feels she needs to live up the remaining time in her 20's with this group as they will then consider her old once she hits 30. Things have completely changed with her over the last couple months with her wanting to go out multiple times a week for after work drinks and party with this crowd. I of course get left behind to put the kids to bed and look after them these nights.

At first it wasn't an issue, but now it has taken its toll on me. I've approached her about what's going on and she swears she's not cheating on me which I believe and this is just something she needs to get through. What has made it worse though is she continues to push me away and says she needs her time to find out who she is and what she wants. I never thought or got the impression our time spent together or with the kids as a family wasn't fun and enjoyable, so I don't know what to say about this.

What really hurt and has put a strain on my feelings for the relationship now is when she started talking to me about a birthday celebration being put together for some of the people at work and the weekend she decided worked best was our anniversary weekend. She claimed this was the best weekend since it fit in best for all the birthdays and when I mentioned it was our anniversary weekend, all she could say was so. I then said I could get a sitter and we could combine the 2 events to her responding I'm not invited. 

This really broke my heart and I've tried talking to her about it, but I don't think we're getting anywhere on our own. I've mentioned to her we need to go to a marriage counseling and she needs to seek help about some traumatic experiences from her childhood, but she refuses. At this point I'm spending all my time on my kids with school, bought some board games to enjoy with them, and getting into the Halloween spirit to prepare for trick or treating. I find it hard to even have an open conversation with her now as I don't know who this person is.

I really do want to fix this, but what should I do especially since she's not convinced to seek therapy? My plan is to go see a therapist myself to prevent anger and hatred to consume me. I also feel I should go through this next month to allow her to have her big celebration. Once that's out the way, attempt to fix things at that point if she's ready, otherwise I think it's over. Is giving her ""time"" going to hopefully get us to the next step to recovery or will is cause more grief? The last think I want is to split the family, but I don't think it would be healthy for the kids either.

TL;DR

My wife couple months ago started hanging and partying with her younger employees and stays out til late and refuses to spend time with me and the kids citing that she needs to enjoy life and party and this is ruining our family and she refuses to seek help or get couples counselling."

1. How do you feel about a more conversational, engaging tone vs a stiff, formal tone?

2. For people who are switching careers, are you looking for an explanation as to why? Generally, are you looking for the candidate to explain their interest in being an actuarial analyst / intern / etc? 

3. If you can remember some candidates you hired in the past, what stood out about their cover letter (also resume, interview, and so on)?

5a1tjm,2,2016-10-29,"Me [27 F] with my BF [28 M] of 1 year, he's going through hard times and I'm trying to be supportive but I'm feeling overwhelmed",worriedfriend26,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5a1tjm/me_27_f_with_my_bf_28_m_of_1_year_hes_going/,"My bf and I have been together for about a year or so. When I first met him, he was living with his parents and little brother, who is disabled. Without going too deeply into the details, his parents were going through some financial troubles, and he was helping to support them until they could get back on their feet. In May, though, things took a turn for the worse: they were forced to leave the place they were renting (trouble with another family member who kicked them out – it was through no fault of their own; I know because I was there when it happened). They all have bad credit and evictions on their records from financial problems in the past, and so, not being able to find housing, they went to a hotel. They have been staying there for the last five months.

It is taking a toll on my bf. He is working himself to the bone to make enough income to support his entire family. Living in a hotel is expensive. Besides him, they only have the income from his father – which is not much. His brother can’t work because of his disability (which has never been officially diagnosed, hence they receive no help for it). His mother has been working on a computer programming project which, they believe, will eventually help them financially (big time), but thus far has given them nothing.

I’ve posted about this before in a subreddit for my community, and many people tried to help by pointing me to resources for them…but none of them worked because they didn’t qualify, or there were very long waiting lists, and help delayed really is help denied. But that’s not the point of this post. This is all background information.

The problem is, my bf is working extremely hard, and every penny he makes is going to supporting his family. I think it’s unfair, and it makes me feel really sad. I’m trying to be supportive, but I don’t know how things are going to turn out or when this is going to end. And it is taking a toll on our relationship. Bf recently had to take on a second job, and now I barely get to see him. Even when I do see him, we can’t afford to go out unless I pay – and being a graduate student, I don’t make very much. It’s also between work shifts, so we don’t have much time, and he’s so exhausted he usually passes out early.

I feel so sad, and I’ve tried to help – letting his family stay at my place (my one-bedroom apartment) on days when they can’t afford the hotel, letting them come over and use my kitchen to cook (since his brother requires special food), taking care of their cat. But I can only do so much. I can’t change their situation. And I know this sounds selfish, but I have my own life, and my own things that I’m stressed out about – I’m working and completing an internship, trying to prepare for graduation, applying for jobs and PhD programs...and I just feel tired. I know my tiredness is nothing compared to his, but it’s there, and I feel very alone in some ways because I can’t really talk to him about it. He’s just already dealing with so much, I feel like I can’t add my problems to the mix.

I love him so much, but I don’t know how, or when things are going to get better. Everything was great, before they lost their home, we were happy. We make each other really happy. But lately I’ve just been feeling depressed and alone, and I don’t know what to do. I miss how things were. I miss him.

I guess I needed to vent a little bit. But I would appreciate advice, perspectives, support…anything. I just had to say something, somewhere, and have it be heard by somebody.

5a1ygl,5,2016-10-29,STREET PATROL: The Lost Episode,D33PLyManic,creepypasta,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/5a1ygl/street_patrol_the_lost_episode/,"Many of you have probably never heard of the Cops spin off show titled:

""Street Patrol""

The show was created by Cops executive producers who wanted a more ""believable"", more police procedural, reality show. In the beginnings of the shows run it was criticized as being ""boring"" and not as exciting as Cops. However people failed to recognize that this was the point of the show all along. It aired, debuting on truTV, in the beginning of its run but was quickly cast aside and sent to G4 television studios.

Many people credit this to poor ratings and basically a lame concept. People closest to the shows running's might tell you a different story, the real reason the show was quickly canned is far more sinister than we were all led to believe.

I was an intern with Turner broadcasting, (a Time Warner company). I was living in the ATL at the time so I was stationed at truTV's headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. That's my backstory and you can probably determine how this all went down.

There were talks of trying to save the show, its ratings were at a record low, and everyone working on the project feared the worst inevitable outcome was cancellation.

The show as some of you may know is made up of old Cops footage that didn't make the cutting room floor. It was deemed uneventful and didn't have the action people grew to love from Cops so it was handed down to us. So when it came time to preview the last ditch effort the show was going to put forth, there was much excitement in the air. Morgan Langley &amp; John Langley were especially excited and even sat with us in the preview room as the tape started.

I noticed how uneasily excited they both were. They had been so upset in the days before it was strange to see them so thrilled even with their show on the brink of cancellation, yet they kept an almost sadistic smile as the opening credits played.

There were 10 of us, all about the same age, roughly between 20-25, I was the youngest at 20. The room was basically a small conference room, the table we sat at was long and had chairs set up like at an office meeting, with the projector screen in front of us. John and Morgan stood in the back.

After the intro played we noticed that this footage was a lot more grainy than previous shows, it must've been really early footage from Cops' beginning. It wasn't odd to see such old footage but it was in such bad shape, it jumped a lot. There was sound, barely audible mumblings of the two police officers on the screen, they appeared to be walking through an old warehouse of some sort. Either the footage was just really bad or the camera guy was literally shaking, his hands so unsteady. Other interns were complaining of motion sickness.

The show rolled on.

The audio jumped all of a sudden, spiking through our ears like an ice pick falling against a chalkboard. It was bad. One female intern screamed loudly and the rest of us let off a cry. I was intrigued because our editors were normally very good about this, it seemed almost amateurish in the way it was cut together. Nonetheless it was unsettling.

Morgan and John stood in the back of the room chuckling to themselves. The show went on and the camera man seemed to be coughing and complaining of some ""smell"". The other officers, I noticed, now had their weapons drawn. The footage was ranging in and out of focus, one second it was color the next it was black and white, sound continued to drop in and out and I was getting restless, along with the rest of the interns. I was just about to get up and leave but then the officers began moving a shelf of some kind, behind it, a door.

The sound came into focus and the officers were debating whether to call for back up or enter the door. The camera man was pleading that they called in first.

They decided that ""time was of the essence"" and tried the door, it wouldn't budge. The male officer kicked at it but to no avail. It must've been reinforced with steel or something, I don't know. That always seemed to work in the movies and I was surprised it didn't this time.

I heard John in the back whisper,

""Here we go...""

The officers tried their radios but they weren't picking up any frequencies. The male officer decided to go back outside to the squad car he said, to get better connection. The female and camera man stayed behind. They stood there talking, when the door slowly creaked open. The women interns shouted at this, letting out a little squeal of surprise. I felt chills roll down my back.

The officer looked at the camera and decided they would enter. Morgan in the back chuckled I looked back at the two of them and they waived to me to keep watching. I wish I hadn't. The camera man puked as they entered the room, The officer entered first, she cleared the room and that's when the camera followed behind. The light switch flicked up but no light came on so the camera man turned on the night vision on the camera.

Hanging from the rafters of the roof were naked women, bloody and cut up, some looked fresh blood still dripping from the corpses others seemed rotting away, however it was harder to see details with the night vision.

A couple of interns ran out of the room.

The camera man began screaming but the female officer couldn't see any of it, she was blind in the dark, she bumped into the first corpse and intestines fell out onto her head, she fell down and screamed out of shock, disgust and confusion. The camera man was screaming at the top of his lungs at something we couldn't see. The officer began firing wildly as we saw a figure move behind a body. The camera turns to the door, it shut violently.

John and Morgan were in the back of the room laughing hysterically.

Suddenly all is quite besides the sobbing of the camera man. He's waiving the camera around the room and the female officer is nowhere to be seen. He begins walking around the room calling for her, he calls her name a couple times and then shrieks quite loudly as we see her, shirt torn open and a man standing over her seemingly biting into her flesh.

She's convulsing wildly her gun raised in the air, it's clicking but she's out of ammo.

The door begins to bang from the outside, the male officer is screaming for them to open the door the camera man turns away and faces the door when he turns back the man attacking the officer is gone. At this point there were only about four of us left in the room besides John and Morgan. They were still standing in the back laughing maniacally, that on top of the show itself was the most disturbing of the whole situation. I remember it vividly the way they laughed each time one of us screamed, or groaned from the gore. I wanted out of this room, but maybe more, on some sick level I needed to see how it ended.

The camera man is sobbing loudly begging for the officer to break down the door, to save him. He begins praying in Spanish. A gun shot is heard and it seems the officer on the outside is trying to shoot his way into the room, it isn't working. The camera man is running around the room as grunts are heard from all over the room.

He comes to the officer's body, amazingly she is still conscious tears are strolling down her face as she is still trying to fire her empty weapon. Then her eyes grow wide and she drops the gun and points behind the camera man. As he turns the man is standing behind him. He head butts the camera and it falls. The officer continues to scream and bang on the door from the outside as the camera man is shrieking in pain seemingly being savagely attacked by the man.

The attack stops and the camera is picked up off the floor. The camera closes in on the female officer, her eyes a blank dead stare, one tear still streaming down her cheek. She was pretty.

The camera turns to a body on the floor, a chubby man with a black goatee, his stomach is torn open intestines splayed over the floor and his corpse. His face is locked in a grimace. The camera beings to walk to the door, the officer is heard on the outside sobbing it seems. A hand reaches out and opens the door. The officer is standing there crying.

He then screams, ""Get on the floor!""

The camera is thrown into his face and he falls, letting off a few shots from the weapon. The camera shows a man on top of the officer savagely attacking him. The attack stops, the man looks into the camera.

He smiles and waives at it, and the footage ends.

As the end credits play the lights to the room turn on the few of us left in the room are left wondering what exactly we just saw. Was it a hoax? Was it real? John and Morgan give an applause at their work. They look at us, at all of us and they say:

""Complaints of ratings will surely end after this hits the air tonight.""

One of the interns is crying. John and Morgan left the room after.

As far as I know only a few other people, executives at the corporation, saw the episode. They burned the footage, or so we were told. John and Morgan were asked to step down as show runners, at least until things around the office cooled down. We were threatened with lawsuits and our internships if we told of what we saw.

I left the company a week later, I couldn't handle it. I don't know what happened to the other interns, all I know is I still have questions I want answered. Where was this footage taken? How was it found? Why was it made? One thing is for sure.

I'm sure as hell glad it was taken off the air..."
5a216b,2,2016-10-29,Should I continue with the internship I currently have or keep my two work-study positions?,lupincalo,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5a216b/should_i_continue_with_the_internship_i_currently/,"I'm currently in school majoring in Geography and minoring in CS. I'm doing an IT internship with a great company that's about 30 minutes away and doing two work-study positions on campus, one with the earth sciences department and one with the anthropology department. Due to my crammed schedule next semester, I have to choose either the IT internship or the two positions on campus. 

The benefits of the IT internship is that it pays a little better and I don't have a cap on the amount I can earn. The cons are that it's further and if anything were to happen to my car, I'd be screwed. There may also be the possibility of working there full time after graduation, but I'm planning on moving once I've finished. 

The benefits of the two work-study positions include close proximity to home and school, more relevant to my degree, and the potential to network and meet professors that could help me find a position in the future. The only negative aspect is there's a maximum amount of work-study funds I can receive in a year. I emailed the office of student employment hoping they might know how much I can receive. I was awarded $3000 and will have used about $900 by the end of this semester, leaving me with $2100 for next semester. I was told it's relatively easy to get additional funds. 

I have rent to pay, which is about $500 a month with utilities, car payments which is about $120 a month, and a $30 phone bill. If I were to live extremely frugally, I could get by with the work-study positions for three months before having to ask for additional funding. I wouldn't be opposed to going to a temp agency and getting a part-time job working third shift if I have to. Some more info: I'm making $12 an hour at the IT internship and $10.15 on campus. It seems less is taken out in taxes for the work-study positions, but I don't know if that's actually the case. Thoughts would be much appreciated!

edit: and I have about $2000 in emergency funds. "
5a3bir,11,2016-10-29,Norman feels a little weird.,ReckoningGotham,lifeofnorman,https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/5a3bir/norman_feels_a_little_weird/,"He was unsure, really, what the problem was.  He got up at his usual time, showered and shaved (he lost a little of the hot water a bit early but he truthfully didn't mind).   His breakfast and morning commute were very satisfactory.  

He just had a bit of a feeling.  He pushed it aside, so as not to waste company time, and figured he'd ruminate on it over his lunch break.  He worked diligently and achieved a normal amount of productivity.  His coworkers were cordial with him, and he was back.  Judith, the new intern, cracked a joke he found quite amusing while taking his files.

As lunch approached, he considered his meal--leftover takeout from last night.  He had had an odd craving and, while certainly high in sodium, decided to treat himself to a half-portion so as to save the rest for the workday.  He had been walking recently and figured a tad bit of junk food was fine so long as he didn't overdo it.  

Lunch arrived and and Norman waited to use the microwave.  Judith was there, twiddling on her phone, waiting for her boyfriend to call back.  He told her that her joke was quite funny, and asked her what she was eating.  It was beef stew, apparently.

Normally, Norman very much enjoyed hearing about others' lunch--he was quite a crock pot enthusiast, but today, it didn't seem to interest him, and he thought about how...off-kilter he felt.  He told himself that he would reflect on it over lunch, and decided to do just that.

Norman dedicated his entire thought process to it.  

""Healty mind, healthy life,"" he thought to himself as he went down the list of things that could have given him just a little bit of stress.  His finances were in order--he had recently set nearly all of his bills to be on auto-pay, which was quite a relief and added about an hour to his week of just free time.  He felt healthy, he thought, no aches or fever.  His pets were clearly healthy.  

With no solution to his feeling of unease, Norman figured he might just be having an off day.  He finished his meal and discarded his notebook pad, scribbling out the contents so that no one snooping would worry.

He resumed work and finished out the day.

He got home, completed his routine, and decided to give Norman some extra attention tonight.  That was quite a proper distraction!  He had a store of catnip he rarely broke out but couldn't resist making Norman feel very cozy and safe.  He got quite a laugh about it.

Later in the evening as Norman settled in to his bed, the feeling of unease--like the idea that he had missed the bus, returned.

""Perhaps,"" he said quietly and out loud, ""this feeling will pass by morning."""
5a3e6d,28,2016-10-29,To my ex-fiancée.,docscott,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5a3e6d/to_my_exfiancée/,"I find myself thinking of you recently. It's been months since you broke things off with no explanation other than ""I can't do this anymore."" I found myself missing you, until I thought back on our relationship.

I was there for you during your darkest times. When you nearly cheated on me with my best friend, when you were having seizures near daily and I dropped out of classes to support you, when you dropped out of school because you weren't sure what you wanted to do. I was there, I may not have agreed with all of your choices, but I was there to support you.

Once I started having suicidal thoughts, and got on antidepressants, you became distant. You wouldn't talk to me for days at times, even when I'd try to talk to you. When I quit my job to focus on school, you got furious at me, even though you told me a few months prior that I should quit and take that internship. We didn't even live together then. You just up and left me as I was struggling with depression. But you know what? I thank you for it. It taught me that you weren't giving 100% in our relationship, something that I was too blind to see.

So thank you for breaking my heart. It will make me a better person."
5a3u3y,3,2016-10-29,Me [19 F] Needs advice for commuincating with my professor to fix a huge mess I created,sadschoolgirl2019,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5a3u3y/me_19_f_needs_advice_for_commuincating_with_my/,"I fucked up. And I don't know if I can fix it, I am a little freaked out right now, so this may get a a little long.

Background: I am going to school for a competitive major in a very competitive school. After this first year they will only accept a handful of students to move on in the program. We have 3 projects this semester and that is it, no other assignments. 

Problem: I did not do a good job on the most recent project. I was disappointed in myself. Basically I chose to redo the project because I wanted the craftsman’s ship to be perfect. So I took my first project apart and tried to redo it. But I procrastinated and rushed and long story short it was incomplete. An incomplete project will go down a letter grade. The morning the project was due, I was rushing around trying to finish and left part of the project at home.  I had a few minuets to grab the missing pieces from home, but chose that day to leave my keys in my uber, which made my window of time disappear. I informed my TA that I would not be able to turn in the missing pieces. I was upset, I would be getting an F on the project, even though I had a B project at the beginning of this mess. 

However I was not going to obsess over it. I learned a valuable lesson, I deserve a F, and will not ever make the same mistakes ever again. I had a whole game plan for the upcoming last project and was going to work really hard,  to get a C in the class, and decided that one poor grade in one class is not the end of the world. I was going to be okay. I was going to go into my professors office hours, explain I need help doing better this section to pass, and ask her to help me with my work by showing her what I had so far and whatnot.

BUT THE REAL PROBLEM is now I have to have a completely different meeting with her because I am a dingbat. We have to hang our projects while they get graded.  I misread the directions and thought w would take down the assignments the next day. Obviously that was a dumb assumption because there are over 100 students in the class, and the projects would take many days to grade. Today I went to the school to do homework, and realized that everyone’s projects were still up. I reread the directions and saw that I was wrong. My project had not been graded yet. 

I messed up bad this week. I was aware an F was not good at all, but I could still pass if the project received 40 points at least, and I did great on the last project. But if I get a zero on this project there is no way I can pass this class, therefore not moving on in the program. I have already been at school an extra year and my education is funded by loans only because my parents make too large of an income to receive aid, but cannot afford to put three kids through college. I cannot afford waiting a year to retake the class only offered fall semester. 

I need to talk to my professor. I want to ask her for help. Maybe she has a solution, maybe not.  But I wont know if she can help me if I don't ask. However she is cold. She is not warm and fuzzy, and quite frankly she may not care at all. It is not her problem, and I understand that.I won’t dislike her or feel she is unfair is she says no, because what happened was purely me. 

But I am a good student. A 4.0 type of student. I received a good grade on the first project, I go to every class, participate in class critique, and genuinely enjoy her class. I have an A in all of my other major specific courses. I am actively involved with my major, sought out an internship, am on the board of a major organization. Basically I care a lot, and what happened this week should not define my entire future at this school. 

So my question is how can I ask for her thoughts? She may have a forgiving side I am unaware of. How can I explain my problem to her, while sounding genuine, and taking full responsibility, but still asking for her help. I don't want her to forgive my poor project, I want her to forgive me taking down my project before I could receive any points at all. The good news is I actually took a picture of my project hung up, so she will be able o see I am not trying to be dishonest. Are there words students should use, or anything? I want her to know that I understand that I messed up bad. But I am excited for this next project, and want to work hard to have a chance of passing. 
 
TLDR: How can I  ask a professor for a second chance, in a way that makes me sound mature and willing to work very hard?"
5a4082,22,2016-10-29,Tier II Law School employment success story (non-law position),NPR_is_not_that_bad,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/5a4082/tier_ii_law_school_employment_success_story/,"Hello fellow law students! 

I wanted to briefly share my journey to employment, from the perspective of a decent law student (25-30% class rank) at a Tier II school. I started this year (3L) with zero job opportunities, and just a few months later I now have two offers from Big4 accounting firms for International Tax, and one Big4 consulting offer. Negotiating salaries now, and will accept one of them soon. I want to share my story because law school can be incredibly scary, particularly when you have loans and little job prospects. I developed my job strategy by studying Reddit, abovethelaw, and by talking with mentors and friends. This is my story. 


I really started to build the foundation of my job strategy during my second year. Completely by the way the schedule was set up, I took 2 tax classes and 2 business classes my first semester. I ended up liking those courses and decided that I was going to focus my law classes on Business and tax subjects - and away from traditional law courses like Trial related classes, federal courts, etc. For those who know what they want to do, focusing your experience and classes IS HUGE.  The fact that I decided to focus my classes on corporate law/tax allowed me to acquire an expertise, and was a talking point in every interview. I tailored my resume towards tax/finance law, sought out internships that would provide that type of work experience, wrote onto the journal of international law and business, and labeled myself as a tax and business law-focused guy. 

So starting this year, my 3L year, I had no idea where I could possibly work, but I knew I wanted to do something either tax or business related. I had summer clerked at two small, but reputable firms, the second of which is in the city of my law school and asked me to continue working - but told me that they were not going to hire anyone for this coming year. As most of you know, top law firms will almost exclusively hire from their summer associates, and with me at a Tier II with not top grades, no chance. 

So I figured that I had no shot at any law firm I would actually want to work for, and that the prestigious clerkships are ridiculously competitive, so I decided to try and look for positions that my fellow students were not looking at. 

I researched alternative tracks for attorneys and found that consulting, compliance, and tax work were the big three. So I started by looking up a bunch of companies that I would consider working for, and finding out if there were any alumni of the law school working there in legal-related. And actually, I found that there was at least one alumni at most of the businesses. So I reached out and tried to make a connection. 

What was important is that I reached out to alumni with the stated intention of just learning more about the job. I did not ask if they could hook me up, or if they were hiring, merely just to schedule a phone call and learn about what they do. This helped me build relationships that helped me get my foot in the door for a couple opportunities that would have been otherwise unavailable.  

Another major helping factor is that I petitioned the business school to allow me to apply to positions on their job boards. I applied to anything that sounded like there was an analytical component, or tax/accounting/finance related, and got probably 10 interviews through that. While my fellow law students were applying for the very few 3L job board positions with 100 people vying for a shitty law job or state clerkship, I was getting flown into cool cities, having recruiting dinners and socials, going through business job recruiting process. 

So as I recruited, I emphasized all of the ""soft skills"" and professional acumen that I had gained in law school, and employers liked that. Almost all of them said that I could learn the technical components of the job while working. While common consensus seems to be that a law degree does not transfer well to other professions, and this is definitely true for many, I found my law education to have been extremely easy to market in the business world.

Now I am at the point where I have some great offers in cool cities - all at non-law firms. If I had to compete against my law classmates or other law schools, I do not think I would have been able to even get to the interview. But the fact I reached out to less-traditional positions, and was one of few law students applying, I stood out and it made a positive difference.

I wanted to share my story because I think there are a lot of talented, capable, and valuable law students that don't realize they can look outside of the traditional law (firms and clerkships) realm.  And in fact, with so few JDs that I went up against (mostly MBAs), I found that my law background gave me a leg up on others because I was rare. 

Summary of my suggestions: 
1) Try and focus your law degree (on Business, medical, IP). You don't have to only take your focus-related classes, but it helps a lot to have a list of your relevant courses on your resume and a competency in a specific field.

2) Petition to get onto the Business School job board - or general campus job board. (This one was HUGE for me) 

3) Reach out to alumni at non-traditional law positions. They will admire your ambition and are more likely to help you out than those at the top firms IMO. Build the relationship with the alum, don't ask for a job. 

4) Utilize people you know, they will help you. 

Best of luck to all who may read this!"

I got this position through a friend. They weren't actively looking for front end devs but decided to invest in me and give me a job as I did pretty well in the interview. The CTO said it would be bumpy to start as they don't really have a legit mentor/onboard process like a place like Facebook or AirBNB may have. So kind of left to my own devices.

5a44fo,5,2016-10-29,[rant] I feel like my career aspirations disappoint everyone who knows me,dc74089,teenagers,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/5a44fo/rant_i_feel_like_my_career_aspirations_disappoint/,"Rant incoming. It's a big'un. And really whiny too. (Sorry.)

I'm a senior this year. Robotics is my thing, I'm on two teams, I've made it with my team to the world championships of the competition three times, I helped found my school team, and have been on team leadership all through high school. I've also gotten into app development and am nearing 10 thousand downloads on my most successful thing. I'm taking some of the highest classes my school offers and making mostly As. I count my blessings daily that these things come easily to me, and I try to pass it on and do good things with what I've got as much as I can, which usually means a bunch of volunteer work.


With college applications and just general adulthood approaching, I've been thinking of what I want to do with my life. With everything I've done so far, it seems like a career in computer science is a no brainer: I like it, I understand at least the basics of it, and you can go far in that field, there's big money to be made. I'm sure I'd be okay with that. But that's not what I really want. Over the past two or so years, I've had some opportunities to do volunteer work and paid work with children. I started off as a tutor at my school (which has an elementary school on the same campus as high), loved it, and started doing that as much as possible. Then last summer I had the opportunity to apply to work at a local sleepaway summer camp and those couple months were amazing. This year I asked my school for the opportunity to be an assistant in a 5th grade math class instead of taking a study hall and I got it, 2nd period every single day. I couldn't ask for a better teacher in that class, she gives me almost daily opportunities to get up there and actually teach. I love it so much, it's as addicting as I would imagine crack cocaine to be. 


So I want to be a teacher. That's what I want to do with my life. And while I have a few adults and friends that are more than supportive, I've had a huge amount of very blunt push back. ""Those who can't do, teach. You're above that."", ""Teaching is miserable, you barely get a living wage."" , ""Why would you teach when you have a shot at actually being successful?"". I've heard the words ""waste of potential"" so much that I'm about to drop kick the next person that says it. But even with it all, I feel like I've found my calling (Dramatic and cliché? Absolutely. But do I feel that way? Yup). I just feel so guilty disappointing so many people I really respect, my parents included. 


I'm taking at all with a grain of salt. I'm a few days past 18, and I don't expect to have a 10 year plan laid out for myself. So many things can change. But it's starting to matter, with which colleges I apply to and ultimately choose, with what classes I take, and what I do in my free time (tech internship or school internship? Job at the campus IT desk or the campus day care?). I know I have time and that there are much more important things to worry about, but this is a huge stress in my life right now. "
5a4bbu,1,2016-10-29,22F4M - Nurse/Caregiver Girl Scene,ageplaybabysitter,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5a4bbu/22f4m_nursecaregiver_girl_scene/,"Hi there!

So the basis of this scene is that I play a young (college-aged) nurse or caregiver who is a genuine do-gooder type, sweet and spunky. Her first job (either intern or recent grad) involves caring for a few older men who live in a home by themselves. It might be attached to a larger hospital or retirement home but these guys, while older, have certain degree of independence while still requiring some help.

The effect that the presence of a young, fresh-faced and eager girl with them is noticeable and, at first, she delights in being a bit teasing and flirty with them.

But, she quickly realizes that teasing alone would be cruel and figures, why not, she can make these men feel good in other ways too! So she quickly becomes their enthusiastic sex toy, delighting in the attention and the compliments they give her as she uses her body to get them off just about any way she can.

Thats the basic gist of it, just a good-natured girl ""giving back"" in her own special way. I want it to be rather teasing at first and we can escalate it at different paces for different characters (please be open to playing a few!). We can work out characters and backstory in PMs as well as anything else that we should go over.

Kinks are definitely up for discussion but I'm thinking teasing, exhibitionism, oral, anal, cumplay, etc. are good. Possibly we could work in some toys, watersports (if you're into that), and whatever else.

Hope to hear from you!

5a6hwp,3,2016-10-30,[MF] Status Quo reversed,Obermarschall,shortstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/5a6hwp/mf_status_quo_reversed/,"Sandra Malheiro woke up quiet early at 6:30 am. She was still tired but had a lot of thoughts that woke her up. She moved two months ago from Cidade Mars de Salazar to the new city of Conglomerado de Ricardo Almeira. She is in her early 30’s and spent a good amount of her life in the Portuguese military. The sun on the moon of Europa is like a tiny dot, but Jupiter appears really astonishing. It was one of few pros of why she liked to live on Europa. For the rest she didn’t like it. In general, she hated her life. 
Yes, she had a good career in the military, she was even member of the interplanetary body of the Partido Regenerador Portugues, but she saw that she was never enough. She was a unique exception among all these men who were part of the military and the party. Usually women didn’t make a career in the military as this was despised by men and women equally. In the doctrine of the Portuguese Empire, it was stated that each sex had their own role to fulfil, ‘in order to guarantee prosperity and equal opportunity for the Portuguese citizen’. In the military, she was schooled in detail for a year about ‘state loyalty’ and ‘History of Portuguese doctrines and principles’ as well as ‘Functioning of the Estado Novo’. Many of the things that were said there were almost against her own self…as woman. It was suggested that women go and take ‘social jobs’ and that men take ‘responsibility jobs’. Men couldn’t take ‘social jobs’ and women were mostly not allowed to take ‘responsibility jobs’ and yet she was part of the military and the PRP. She swallowed all her life things that were said about women being like this and men like that and had enough of it. However, she was unsure how to address it. 
When she walked out in the main avenue of the Conglomerado de Ricardo Almeira, she saw how the construction workers erected a huge 200m statue of Salazar and Sidonio Pais next to each other. This were preparations for the celebration of 1500 year Portugal. The hologram TV and ads talked about how magnificent and glorious the Portuguese cities were. Lisbon with 20 million people, Rio de Janeiro with 15 million, São Paulo da Assunção de Loanda with 13 million, Macau with 13 million as well and the moon city Vila Nova de Lua with 12 million. The TV talked about Portuguese master engineering and how the Portuguese Empire’s doctrine promoted human progress. Free drinks were also given on the street while she walked.
‘Here lady, take a free Sagres to our heroes, Portuguese Empire and doctrines’, said the advertiser.
‘Obrigado’, nodded Sandra politely. 
‘Oh, you are in the army?’, the man looked at her with sceptical eyes and Sandra just gave a short ‘Sim’ as answer. Unfortunately, she was used at these questions and stares. She didn’t feel respected for what she was and her personality. Nevertheless, she promised to herself, that no matter what she would fight to keep her dream job.  She didn’t like beer much, but thought since it’s free she will just drink it. On the corner she came across ticket sellers. They sold tickets for the solar football match between Benfica and Sporting, the two biggest sports clubs in the Portuguese Empire. They had billions of members, in particular in football. 
‘Oiiiiila, here are tickets for you too lady! It was sponsored by our great Empire and is a match also in honour of Ricardo Almeira. Take it and let the Empire make you happy with bola!’, said the guy enthusiastically. Football was a big deal in the Portuguese Empire and the main sports. Even on the moon, Mars and Europa (moon), football knew no boundaries. She sometimes went there, but mostly for representative matches, where high officials had to be present. If you were not present in the match, you’d be seen as traitor to Portuguese values and then again sports were predominantly male… such an irony she always thought to herself.
Sandra continued her walk and enjoyed looking up at the sky seeing Jupiter. Jupiter maybe will make her life one day better? Nah, these thoughts are now nonsense. She was having many inner monologues, as not many people could relate to her. She was very introvert too, but not shy. She could stand her own ground, but within the conditions of the doctrines. She wished for controversial debates about these doctrines and she surely disagreed on the continuous improvement and progress in the Portuguese Empire. Social progress was stuck and even split men and women more than ever apart. Men who took social jobs, did they exist? She wasn’t sure, but hoped to meet one of these men maybe here in the Conglomerado? Before she could continue her thoughts general da Silva came across and greeted her.
‘General Malheiro, I greet you!’, he looked at her with respect and gave her a strong handshake.
‘I greet you back honourable General da Silva, may our glorious day as Portuguese Empire continue’, she said and then she moved in the military office.
When she came there, the receptionist Manuel Ferreira da Cruz informed her that Salazarismo-Marshal Peixoto ordered the whole division of the city to take part of a drill tomorrow. It was one of a spontaneous nature and ensured that his division was in permanent red alert. She took note of it on her medium. 
‘Be sure that nothing goes wrong, as it’s part of the celebration of our Empire. You have my full servitude in case of questions. Have a very prosperous day!’, said the receptionist.
A cold obrigado slipped from her lips and she headed towards the instant transmission machine. She gave her coordinates and went there in one second. Everything seemed very hectic today, because of the celebration. And since the doctrine teaches them to be foremost loyal to Portugal, it was a very logic consequence. Her face went from enthusiastic to even more enthusiastic…not at all. She took a huge breath and thought to herself ‘stay calm’. The more she thought about what the state taught them, the more she found it artificial and constructed from above. She was merely a soldier, because she wanted to protect her loved ones and not because she liked the doctrine. Despite her being a woman and where it was said that she can’t protect people, her uncle helped her to get a position. He was in the second-highest rank within the military and a very important party member as well. He never had kids himself, so treated Sandra as his own daughter instead. When Sandra told him since a little girl, that she wanted to be in the military, contrary to the doctrine, under which he worked for, he made the contrary. After she finished an all-female school, she didn’t go to study social sciences, but she gave her application to become a soldier. Her uncle managed to convince the staff about her abilities and argued that she was the exception and the exception confirms the rule. A minority disagreed and argued with the doctrine, but most generals, marshals etc were actually very satisfied with Sandra. Sandra presented herself as uttermost loyal to the Portuguese cause and had great knowledge of Portuguese history as well as the space expansion program. She wished to be stationed outside the Earth, where she had more opportunities. At that time the army was happy to receive people for posts outside Earth, as there was a general shortage. Immigration was therefore also encouraged by the Portuguese Empire as well, with many financial benefits. Sandra came first to Vila Nova de Lua, twelve years ago and was absolving her formation there. She did exceptionally well and instead of 4 years, was already taken after 3 with an honorary degree. She enjoyed certain privileges, like living in her own place, 8-hours-day and could come and go without much administrative work. People never questioned her and saw her as her uncle’s successor. But this and also the doctrine and mostly the doctrine made her resent her life. She didn’t want to be an exception, she wanted to be normal and treated like everyone else and neither have privileges or be treated less. She didn’t understand these contrary behaviours she experienced. On one hand, she was not enough, she was just a woman, on the other hand, she was treated better than most other soldiers. 'This doctrine...why does it even exist?...Salazar and Pais...did you intent this? Was this your vision of Portugal', she thought to herself.
She then revised the plans of how everything should be followed during the drill, which people are assigned to her and mostly other technical details. She was getting tired of that. She was a soldier to protect her loved ones and not to maintain and propagate the doctrine. Salazarismo-Marshal Peixoto came unannounced at her place.
'Well, well how are we doing General Malheiro?', he asked.
She was caught with intern surprise. Her face stayed normally neutral.
'Honourable Salazarismo-Marshal Peixoto, which pleasure to see you personally in my department. I'm doing well and analysing with greatest attention the plans for tomorrow. Moreover, I am greatly thankful to always serve the imperial Portuguese forces!', she said in almost shouting voice.
She looked petite but she certainly wasn't weak. She was skilled and fast, most importantly very courageous.
'That's fantastic dear general. I hear that you are as good as your uncle. He made himself an eternal name within our forces. Many of my comrades are saying only good things about you and how skilled you are... well I was thinking, we should consider your achievements, your loyalty and your brave attitude dear general. In fact, the high military commission ordered to see you tomorrow! We all think that it's time that you will be declared a Salazarismo-General!,' said Salazarismo-Marshal Peixoto.
Sandra was certainly surprised and was even feeling proud... But then she thought to herself for what? Proud to follow the doctrine by every step? To swallow every letter of it against her own dissatisfaction? 
'So?' evoked Salazarismo-General Peixoto.
'Sorry I was just taken apart for a moment as I couldn’t believe my own ears', she replied.
'Hahaha it is okay General! Or should I say Salazarismo-General Malheiro. In fact, though I’m a bit longer then you in service I always stand with great pleasure in front of you. I’m proud of Portugal and proud of the Portuguese people and you contribute to this pride. Billions of Portuguese are proud of you!'
She faked her smile and tried to convince herself just for that moment to be happy. Deep within she felt some pride, but it faded quickly away and was blown like the sand in the Sahara. She shakes hands with Peixoto. She always noticed his moustache and his old-fashioned general hat. She didn’t blame him for the doctrine. He was just filling his role and convinced by all sides to fulfil a role. Who knows maybe he was a man who wanted to do social jobs, but never had the opportunity? 
'Oh and by the way...before I forget you are a candidate for a new position within the party. This will allow you to have more mobile hours so you can dedicate as much time needed for your positions. I know I say candidate but it is almost clear you'll be elected. I bet my moustache to that hehe', and the general started to laugh foolishly. 'Really and which position exactly?', asked Sandra.
'To be honest I forgot it now or wait... it was to become member of the upper committee of ALL the party', said Peixoto with a fierce voice. 'In any case be prepared, but I think you know that as you are one of the best Portuguese. The Portuguese Empire can be proud to have you as their citizen!
'Thanks Salazarismo-Marshal Peixoto. I take all your compliments with great pleasure, especially from someone as important and with such a remarkable and gifted leadership as you. The message is equally received with great happiness and pride. Thank you!' said Sandra. 
She hates it how artificial these speeches were, but somehow this was usus within the Portuguese Empire. 
Peixoto gave his farewells and left the office through the teleporter. Sandra thought whether she should accept the positions or not. She thought of it all day long. She went back home after finishing work several hours later, still thinking on that one issue. Whether to take the positions or not. All this thinking made her feel heavy. On her way back home she sat on a bench thinking and was noticed by a stranger. Without much nervousness this stranger approached her and was certainly surprised by Sandra's military decoration. He first sat next to her and watched her for few seconds. Sandra was too much self-absorbed in her own thoughts, however she could never ever refuse this offer...nobody did so and she would just cause attention towards her. So without further ado she thought she is going to accept the positions but very self-critical of course. It wasn't until then when she finished to worry about that, that the stranger asked her something.
'Are you a member of the Portuguese forces?', he asked.
'Yes a very proud and confident member. My rank is that of a general!'
'Oh wow I'm surprised and sorry I didn’t talk to you with respect.'
'It is okay; I think for today to be honest I have enough of respectful talking.'
'Oh I see, why? If I may ask?'
'Now I want to be myself. I'm Sandra Malheiro. Not just a general or member of the army, I am a person as everyone else.'
'My manners where are they? I am Nuno Delgado and well I work in a social job as you can see on my sign here in my chest.'
Sandra was literally surprised to meet under such circumstances someone as random and almost as her but on the opposite side. How come he made a social job?
‘I see, I am sorry but I am unused to see a man working in a social job? How come?’, she asked.
‘That’s a typical question, but I won’t take it badly, as I was also surprised to see a woman in the army, though our superior and almost godly doctrine says the contrary’, he mocked in front of her.
She was surprised he mocked about the doctrine in front of her. Was he a spy or an agent in disguise? Was he testing waters to see if Sandra was as loyal as her façade always portrayed it? Her gut feeling told her otherwise and she opened up a little more.
‘There are exceptions to the doctrine I suppose, I guess I am one of them somehow. However, I was lucky as my family was involved in the military and I was one of the few children. I always wanted to be part of the military, since I was young, you know. How did you come to take a social job?’, Sandra demanded.
‘Well, my family was one of the first to come to the Conglomerado of Ricardo Almeira, like 100 years ago. My grandfather and father worked on the construction and all, but once it became finalized and less people were needed in construction, they were left with their family. And of course there are children who need to go to school. So about 20 years ago the shortage of teaching staff was countered by ‘special measures’. Yes, I am one of the few men employed as teacher and I am lucky, because I wished for that, since I was small. I just never understood, why as men we must do the other jobs and not social jobs as well,’ he said.
Both talked more and started to appreciate each other in some way and stayed in touch.
A year passed, after Sandra accepted the newly acquired positions and meeting Nuno Delgado. Nuno and her became friends. They regularly talked about what was wrong according to them and consequently formed an underground group of 100 people. They became quickly dynamic and had ambitious plans. The first one was to deactivate or change the doctrine for good. The doctrine was seen as ‘burden to all Portuguese’ and as ‘lie for-shadowing Portuguese master engineering’. The Portuguese society had, according to them finally, to be emancipated from an old doctrine and changes had to be adapted. Otherwise the Portuguese Empire would utterly fail. There was no true head in this group and there was even not really a name, as they just wanted to force a change in the doctrine. They didn’t fight for revolution or saw themselves as such, they were opposed to the doctrine and that kept them together. 
Today, for the annual imperial celebration, Sandra and Nuno planned on paralyzing the military and the government as well and force a change in the doctrine or at least a solar referendum. Their plan was straight forward and Sandra would exploit all her knowledge and powers she had. In fact, she had military and political power and could act without much restriction. 
Usually, the Portuguese law is like that, that when all high officials leave, the highest one who remains is in charge. Without much suspicion, she asked to be part of the latest division, who would show up in the parade. The parade, on Sandra’s demand, was planned to be held on the exosphere of Europa, so the celebrations on Mars, Lua and Earth could be spotted as well, who were on the exosphere as well. Now, she would remain as the last one Europa, with the highest position. Nuno Delgado, would take with him about 10 men and women, different ships and initiate attacks on Ganymede. Sandra gave them the needed papers, so they could pass the guards. Ganymede, as other moons were strictly restricted to enter and an attack would cause furious reactions from the Portuguese Empire. While, the parade starts, Sandra would then give the orders to her military staff to fly out to Ganymede and take Nuno and his companions, but not kill them. They would entrench themselves for some time and then surrender and destroy every evidence of these papers handed by Sandra. 
Sandra on the mean time would take herself control of Europa and ask the other forces to cut communication media and activate Europa’s self-defence program. This would buy them a lot of time, as every ship or person closer than 50km to Europa, would be shot. A forced retreat of the military would be sure. She would then transmit messages to the HQ of the police department of Europa and the ministries, where she declared that she was now in charge, how the self-defence program became manipulated by some intern military staff and that there was a fifth column inside the Portuguese Empire. She would instantly make transmissions to the people of Europa and try to raise as many people as possible as soldiers. An encoded message, which would appear on the HQ of the Portuguese Empire, on Earth, would demand the change of the doctrine or possibly a referendum. 
‘Sandra, I hope we can do that…we need to do that for our future, for the children. I am great and thankful of knowing you and in case we will never see us again… I’d like to say it was a great time knowing you and that I love you and trust you…bye Sandra.’ Nuno left with some tears, but also with a smile of trust. Sandra looked down on the floor, where her long hair would hide her face. She couldn’t handle emotions very well, but deep down, she knew Nuno was a good man and that she wanted to be with him. She had now more courage, as she didn’t want to upset Nuno… In the following hours the plan was finally proceeded. Nuno’s message came that he passed the guards and they accepted the documents. Sandra was glad and now hoped, that all the military staff would leave for space. After she came to the headquarters, she confirmed to the highest military ranks her arrival and watched them leave. She saluted them as it was usual for a soldier to do. After waiting half an hour, she received the message of Nuno, who together with his companions launched their fake attack on Ganymede. 
‘Soldiers…I have bad news…Ganymede our outpost of space interest is attacked. I order you to go now and take them down. I order you to take them and imprison them and question their motifs. Don’t kill, I repeat, don’t kill them…we need to find out who is behind that! For our Portuguese Empire! Força Portugal!’, she shouted and a força Portugal echoed back from the ranks. The soldiers did as they were told. She also persuaded the generals who were left with her to go with them. 
Sandra now prepared the other steps and communicated them to her fellow companions, without much suspicion. They cut the communication with the other planets and moons within seconds and the self-defence program was activated within a matter of minutes. ‘She got a last message before from Salazarismo-Marshal Peixoto’ who told her in the transmission that she was in charge of Europa temporarily. That was unexpected, but strengthened her position now. So far there was no suspicion against her, which delighted her. Sirens were to be heard all over Europa and the streets in the Conglomerado de Ricardo Almeira became full of people, who left their working places or houses. Sandra used all hologram TV and other planetary communication devices and transmitted her speech in there. She asked people to go home, gave the police the command to bring those people safe to their houses and explained that she was now in charge of Europa. She said that a fifth column attacked important military facilities on Ganymede and that she activated the defence system, so that no terrorists could enter Europa:
‘Rest assured, dear Portuguese. We had difficult times and each time we came stronger out of it, but also changed, what we had to change. I declare now myself as the provisional ruler of Europa and I will form a commissioner government. The duration will be unlimited, until we are freed by the Imperial Portuguese forces. Any laws that will be changed, will affect Europa from this day on; for the sake of your own safety and Europa’s stability. Restructuration within the jobs will happen, as we now need to create a good provisional military force, until the Portuguese Empire frees us. This will be my first decree, which will allow also women to take responsability jobs. This means they can from now on join the military forces. Sick men and men with good excuses are to exempt of the military draft. They are, under specific revisions, allowed to join social jobs, for the benefit of our children. The second decree which will be passed, will be the temporary abolishment of the Partido Regenerador Portugues de Europa, until we find out more about the fifth column. Honourable Portuguese citizens, show your courage, I reach my hand to you and together we can dismantle all the dangers. Força Portugal!’ That’s how her speech ended. 
She was sure not everyone would respond positively to her proposals and the changes. She would especially have to get rid of loyalists to the doctrine and reactionaries within the ranks. Nuno was in great danger and she had no communication with him. His fate was now uncertain. She walked around her office in circles and ordered the receptionist to come to her.
‘Dear Salazarismo-Gene… I mean, dear provisional ruler Malheiro, how can I assist you?’
‘Manuel, I want you to address this what I am going to dictate to you, to all police buildings of Europa’
She took a breath and Manuel listened.
‘Dear Imperial Police, as provisional ruler and referring myself to the constitutional right of safety as well as rule 144 paragraph B of the police rules, I ask you to close, all offices of the the Partido Regenerador Portugues and to put the highest remaining members under protective custody. This will remain for an unlimited period of time until Europa is freed by the Imperial forces. Search all offices of the Partido Regenerador Portugues for hints of the fifth column and for hints of treason. With best regards, provisional ruler Malheiro.’
Manuel Ferreira de Cruz checked everything on his device and edited a few words or replaced some words. 
‘Okay I will send it by now, your order will be received in any moment.’
She gave a nice obrigado to Manuel and ordered him to go back to his place. She hoped, that her companions placed the fake hints of terrorism, within the party offices. Like this, the whole committee of a section could already be imprisoned for a short amount of time and buy her more time internally, to push for her reforms. She had no time to lose and fabricate other fake proofs. Her next plan was to play each party member off against each other and then she also needed to solidify her provisional army. Will she succeed?"

They're decent money and low xp. That's where they should be. 
[Timestamp:](https://youtu.be/OFX8ovrOles?t=40m12s) Any updates on scaleable UI? Is it lost with Ian? | It's currently ready with a 1.5x, 2x, and 2.5x etc. He tried making one that's overall scaleable, but it isn't completed. A few things need to be done for release. Ian also said he wanted to rewrite it so it's not tied in so hack-ly. This means it might be a mess and a new engine guy may have to look at it before release.

5a71qo,3,2016-10-30,Masters in Data Science questions - prospective applicant,DataDerp,IndianaUniversity,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/5a71qo/masters_in_data_science_questions_prospective/,"I am a senior in computer science at IUSB who spent my first 2 years at Bloomington campus before taking a year off then transferring to IUSB to save money on tuition. 

I have some research projects and 2 decent internships, data science/viz and machine learning have been interests of mine for several years so I consider myself fairly knowledgeable for an undergrad. Python, R and related ML &amp; scientific computing libraries (tensorflow, numpy/pandas, matplotlib, sklearn  etc.) I've worked with Karst and other similar resources for ML purposes such as AWS EC2 instances. 

With this masters I'm trying to improve my resume a bit and ideally go into something directly data science related instead of general software engineering. But if it just helps me get a higher paying job somewhere nice through IU career services that's also a perfectly acceptable outcome to me. 

So my main question is how competitive is admissions to the program? Should I try to go for the online program? Or half and half online/on-campus option? Get myself an extra year or 2 of job experience? What's the typical accepted student profile? The soic website is uncharacteristically lacking in general info. 

My cumulative GPA is a 3.1 something and I have no true work experience in the field. I have taken a couple practice GREs and gotten in the top 20th percentile range. 

Thanks for all replies and advice "
5a7k2r,11,2016-10-30,I am a pissed off American and heres WHY! Reason 3 will -SHOCK YOU- and the signatures on the Petition will AMAZE YOU.,UnicornMoonPie,The_Donald,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5a7k2r/i_am_a_pissed_off_american_and_heres_why_reason_3/,"I can tell you why I am a pissed off american. Something in me just snapped today...I was trying to get my mind off of everything and was watching some jackass CollegeHumor video that was made the 27th of Oct, where a man puts a Trump hat on and then the man across from him starts spouting out the old argument about why Trump is bad and why Hillary is Good. What made me snap is that these damn media outlets think the American people are stupid, yes. A small percentage is... BUT... most Americans now are getting extremely angry, like myself.... The fact that we are lied to on a daily basis by the main stream media and cant even watch the news anymore. The fact that we feel cut off from the world and have to reach out to other people to really figure out what is going on in the world... ...The fact that our own government is trying to go to war with Russia... and WOULD GO THROUGH WITH IT FOR MONEY.... when our people KNOW that they are simply pulling that shit move because they want to plant a false flag to distract the American people from the corruption of our own government. We are now being distracted by some stupid ass ""Anthony Wiener"" story that the crooked officials in the FBI cooked up... when the american people know for a fact that this is YET AGAIN..... Another distraction from our rotting maggot infested government. 

I am not saying there are not good people still fighting for us... I know there are... We reach out to them on a daily basis and fight to put what information we can together on our own....  but I can say that I do feel like my government has abandoned and turned on me... And the american people......

Well... I will tell you what I did to combat this stupid ass feeling I had....I do the only thing I can think of to get a flame burning in more hearts and to make people aware that we... should not just stand for this ANYMORE!... I go to Whitehouse dot gov and start concocting a petition that I myself as a Pissed Off American, would be proud to sign... So I start mashing away at the keyboard, typing up a fancy little petition. WHICH... I know for a fact is totally illogical but makes me feel justified in some stupid way or other knowing that its linked to the governments official website and that somewhere, it is probably some lowly unpaid interns job to sift through all of the crap petitions that come through that part of the website. Thinking about that makes me chuckle to myself a bit.

Anyway, what got my feathers all ruffled was not them making fun of Trump but the fact that I know they got paid to deliver this message to us.. their target audience. Mostly Americans. Apparently us Americans are easily manipulated sheep and all you have to do is keep spouting the same message so eventually we go ""O! The man bending over backwards showing nothing but love for the American people is actually wrong and the woman who has done nothing but lie and show destain, commit crime and murder is actually right!"" ""Stupid me!""

The fact that this criminal and everyone she is connected to including Obama STILL have their jobs and are running the country... Dictating our media and pumping money into, and invading every known entertainment platform to deliver the Governments message of  ""Hillary is good and Trump is bad!"" Our government is spouting these lies all the while, expecting the little people to abide by the laws they themselves; The very people who are just laughing away the law and pissing on it just continue to rule over us giving us the ""illusion of choice."" Are getting away with every crime known to man. I for one will not be content with a system that tolerates this anymore, which of course is why I am voting for Donald Trump! I am aware that this system would not exist under him but its the fact that Obama is going to pardon Hillary Clinton and several others before Trump even has the chance to step into office that has my underwear in a wad!!!

My first step was making a petition to make people know that I want justice for everyone who has been wronged ...I know that this probably wont get very far but I figured I could try getting it out there and at least just TRY SOMETHING. SO I made this explaining the petition and am hoping it at least gives someone some hope and lets them know that they are not alone in feeling the way that they do...

Thank you so much for listening to this!... What my petition says is as follows.... I will also share the link in the comments....... Thank you..........
 

This petition is important because the very people who signed it are just a small sample of extremely pissed off Americans... Normal everyday people that are tired of the corrupt bullshit we see flowing out of our government. We the People believe in a justice system where; If you commit a crime, you are judged fairly and you serve what ever punishment you are given. Your money does not separate you from the very laws you set up and expect us to abide by anymore. The people signing this document expect Hillary Clinton and EVERYONE who is connected and committed crimes of their own or covered up hers, need to pay for hiding this corruption from us. REMINDER. -When the people fear their government, there is tyranny; When the government fears the people, there is liberty....This was spoken by ..... -
Thomas Jefferson.............

I also want to thank the men and women who cannot speak out just yet because of their compromised positions.. the American People know you are still fighting the corrupt system from the inside.. The american people thank you. and even though you might not be able to speak out. Know that we are aware that you are fighting for us.... and that every good thing you do to fight for our rights and freedom as a nation means the world to me... And to the american people.

I got all hot and bothered today when I was watching some jackass CollegeHumor video that was made the 27th of Oct, where a man puts a Trump hat on and then the man across from him starts spouting out the old argument about why Trump is bad and why Hillary is Good. What made me snap is that these damn media outlets think the American people are retarded, yes. A small percentage is but most are getting angry! Like my fat ass. So here I am getting all hyped and triggered slamming away at my keyboard being a devout keyboard warrior ""IN THE NAME OF TRUMP AND KEK""

So I go on Whitehouse.gov and peck away at the keyboard, typing up a fancy little petition. WHICH, I know for a fact is totally illogical but makes me feel justified in some stupid way or another knowing that its linked to the governments official website and that somewhere, it is probably some lowly unpaid interns job to sift through all of the crap petitions that come through that part of the website.

Apparently us Americans are easily manipulated sheep and all you have to do is keep spouting the same message so eventually we go ""Oh DUH! The man bending over backwards showing nothing but love for the American people is actually wrong and the woman who has done nothing but lie and show destain, commit crime and murder is actually right!"" ""Stupid me!""
The fact that this criminal and everyone she is connected to including Obama STILL have their jobs and are running the country...

My first step was making a petition that will probably never be read by anyone major but I figured I could try getting it out there and at least just TRY SOMETHING. SO I typed this explaining why I did it. I am sure there will be tons of edits to this and everything else.

Thank you for taking the time out of your day to listen to this, the following is what is in my petition description. 

I will share the link in the description below.

5a7v56,48,2016-10-30,It's never as good as you remember,Jester2552,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/5a7v56/its_never_as_good_as_you_remember/,"**Summary:**  Fairly regularly on both TRP and askTRP I see guys asking about getting back with their ex or how to get back at their ex.  I unfortunately stumbled into this trap and I am here to tell you it is just not worth it. The revenged fantasy may sound good in your head but it is never as good as you remember.

**Body:** Slight back story, but I am in the military so I am gone a lot. Whether it be short trips for certain exercises (play war) or deployments which usually last anywhere from 6 to 7 months, there is always something going on in my life. 

My first deployment a few years ago was an eye opening experience. Before I left I had been trying like hell to get with this girl from back home (LDR don’t work BTW but this was my pre-TRP days) who we’ll call Ashley.  Ashley was a HB8 by my standards, 5’6, 125lbs, Latina and had one of the fattest asses I had ever seen. We had talked a little bit before I left but she had a boyfriend and I just didn’t feel like wasting my time talking to a girl with a boyfriend.  So one day after getting destroyed at work; where it would often get to 135+ degrees, I came home to seeing a Facebook message saying “Hey its Ashley, the girl from back home.” Long story short we talked a ton over my tour over there and sure enough when I got home I went to go see her (one of many beta mistakes I made) and we became a couple.  It was fun at first but after a year and a half of only seeing her once every 3 months I ended it. Now it’s important to note that I am the only guy that’s ever broken up with her. She’s one of those types who always had a BF (Red flag I should have seen).


Now we broke up but she would contact me at semi regular intervals, generally on holidays trying to keep me as an orbiter. I never really fell into the orbiter position for her because I was busy chasing girls that weren’t on the other side of the country but I always had thought it’d be nice to see her again. Boy was I wrong.


Shortly after I discovered TRP she messaged me saying she was going to be coming to a city very close to me for some sort of internship. I knew she wanted me to come see her but she played it off as she just wanted me to know that she had succeeded with school, *Rightttttt*. I was going down to this city to visit my brother who lived down there so I said why not, actively keeping TRP teaching s in the back of my mind.

 
When I first pick her up and take her back to the hotel I was staying at she is constantly complaining about how I’ve “changed.” I didn’t say much, would always tease her, never held the door open for her, etc.  We fucked within 20 minutes of being back in my room despite her feigned displeasure with my change but the entire time I just had this overwhelming feeling of how this was not as good I as had remembered.  There was no spark there anymore and it just wasn’t enjoyable, but I was there so I might as well try to enjoy myself.  The amount of shit tests and just straight up bitchiness I had to put up with was just not worth it. Literally, the crying about my “change” just never stopped and she constantly would say she likes nice guys not assholes, even though she just took my load to the face. All of this was also complimented with that fact that she still had a boyfriend back home that she had been with for almost 3 years (AWALT). 


I saw her again the next day but at that point I had just gotten fed up with her constant complaining (She actually thought me coming down to fuck her meant I wanted to get back together) about how I am a completely different person so I kicked her out of my car and went and hung out with my brother for the rest of the time I was down there.


**Lessons Learned:** Exes are just that, Exes. It will never ever be as good as you remember. It’s just better to hard next and search for greener pastures. She was a constant reminder of the lesser male I was many years ago someone who I never wanted to regress back to. While it may be attractive to think, I’m going to show this girl from my past how awesome the new me is, I am telling you from experience to put that energy into lifting and approaching new girls.

5a833a,1,2016-10-30,My boyfriend [22 M] just broke up with me [21 F] a week before our first anniversary. This was my first relationship.,whoupcliklike,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5a833a/my_boyfriend_22_m_just_broke_up_with_me_21_f_a/,"For the past few weeks now, I started getting a feeling that things were becoming off. He started treating me less as a girlfriend and more as a friend. I started to feel less affection from him and we were rarely having sex and those kinds of things started giving me really bad anxiety.

Last Tuesday I had anxiety attack, he said he would come over and talk about it and we nearly broke up. It was clear that I didn't want to, and I tried my best to make sure that the rest would be up to him, not me. He ended saying he wanted to stay with me because ""we've come this far"" and it would be dumb to not try and he said he knew he would regret it. A few days have passed and things still felt forced and faked from him, unless he was drunk, which was the only time he would act affectionate and loving towards me.

Friday texting was weird and later that night he told me he wanted to stop by and talk. I knew he was going to break up with me. It honestly went a little better than expected, but it still has me feeling like I'm in limbo and hanging onto false hope. He's not one to cry, but he came over crying telling me that he needs to focus on himself so he can make sure that he graduates next semester and gets an internship, work on his grades etc. He told me its not about wanting to see other people. I told him I understood. I just wanted to make him feel okay because he was really upset. But it's not what I want. We cried a lot, it was hard. He told me that the last thing we wants is for us to stop talking, he made me promise him that we would even hang out this week. He wants to be friends and work from the bottom up like we did when we first met. He told me that sometimes distance can make people closer. 

For some context, we work together and have the same friend group, so its almost impossible not to see him eventually. I just don't know what to do at this point. I'm waiting for a text from him, I want to talk to him so bad. I miss him and feel physical pain like I never have before. I have never felt this bad before in my life. I don't know if I should try to be his friend. I want to in the hopes that maybe we'll get back together, but on the other side of things I'm scared to because I don't want to be holding onto this and then become even more hurt and disappointed later on. I'm really at a loss. What should I do?
  
---
TL;DR: My boyfriend dumped me and genuinely seems like he still wants to be friends and talk, but I don't want to get hurt more down the road. Do I move on completely or try the whole friend thing in hopes that we may get back together?"
5a8dtm,1,2016-10-30,F4A - The Dark Journey To Fame,Undisclosed_Desires7,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5a8dtm/f4a_the_dark_journey_to_fame/,"Katheyn or what she preferred to be called Katy was the new intern at the company. A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused.

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

---------------

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (some possibly spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

The prompt above doesn't have to be the start or involved in it... just an example of some writing.

Can be different and have a male celebrity and their journey. (Check out my 'Famous Life' posting in my post history for that)

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Megan Fox, Margot Robbie, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba. Though.. the female celebrity can be an original character that is made up would love her to look like Madison Ivy or Lana Rhoades though also into Lindsey Pelas, Emily Sears and Claudia Alende.

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

P.S Also have a recent posting in which I mention all the rp's and things I'm interested in for a long term rp, so check that out if you want, particularly interested in doing a Marvel Black Widow RP or a Post apocalyptic/dystopia world that is similar to Fallout or a Bioshock rp. Also a Walking Dead rp.

In 2000, she worked closely with Hillary Clinton during her New York senatorial election campaign. Her role with Hillary Clinton had grown by 2008 when she became traveling chief of staff of Hillary's campaign. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huma_Abedin

In 2009, Hillary Clinton was appointed Secretary of State. Huma Abedin worked as Hillary's deputy chief of staff at the State Department, and also for the Clinton Foundation, and also as a private consultant during this time. 

In 2010, Huma Abedin and rising Democratic star Congressman Anthony Weiner were married. 

On May 27, 2011, Anthony Weiner accidentally tweeted a picture. He had apparently meant to send it as a DM. Nevertheless, the photo of his erect penis concealed by boxer briefs was publicly tweeted to a 21-year-old female college student from Seattle, Washington.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Weiner_sexting_scandals

A Twitter user identified as ""Dan Wolfe"" made a screenshot of the tweet. Apparently because Anthony Weiner had meant to send the link as a DM, he quickly deleted the public tweet.

Dan Wolfe sent the screenshot to Andrew Breitbart of BigGovernment.com. Breitbart reported the event on his news web site. Thus, a scandal broke concerning Anthony Weiner sexting women. Weiner publicly said he had been hacked. Andrew Breitbart demanded an apology. Breitbart had to hijack a news conference to defend his name. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIJRyJkQXyc

Anthony Weiner was forced to resign from Congress.

On March 1, 2012, Andrew Breitbart died.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Breitbart

In 2013, Hillary Clinton resigned from the office of Secretary of State to prepare her presidential run.

Later in 2013, during Anthony Weiner's run for Mayor of New York City his second sexting scandal broke in the media. He went on to lose the primary, obtaining less than 5% of the vote.

In 2015, a scandal broke concerning Hillary Clinton using a private e-mail server for her activities as Secretary of State. During the investigation by the FBI, classified information was recovered from emails that had been stored on Hillary Clinton's private server. The first Clinton email investigation took over a year to complete partially because investigators needed time to sort through information to determine what was classified.

Huma Abedin later testified under oath that the idea to use the private email server was Hillary Clinton's. At one point, Abedin had recommended that Hillary Clinton start using a government email account as a secondary email account, but Hillary Clinton had rejected the idea, Abedin said. Only Hillary, Huma, and also Chelsea Clinton had accounts on the server, Abedin said.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/top-aide-huma-abedin-says-decision-to-use-private-email-server-was-clintons/2016/06/29/490981d8-3d60-11e6-84e8-1580c7db5275_story.html

On the other hand, in another report, it was Huma Abedin who dismissed the idea of Hillary using a state.gov email address.

http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/266284-email-clinton-aide-rejected-idea-of-govt-email

FBI Director James Comey publicly announced on July 5, 2016 that he would not attempt to bring charges against Hillary Clinton, although she had been extremely careless.

https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/statement-by-fbi-director-james-b-comey-on-the-investigation-of-secretary-hillary-clinton2019s-use-of-a-personal-e-mail-system

On September 21, 2016, reporters broke the story of how Anthony Weiner had been involved in a new sexting  incident, this time involving a 15-year-old girl. 

http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3790824/Anthony-Weiner-carried-months-long-online-sexual-relationship-troubled-15-year-old-girl-telling-hard-asking-dress-school-girl-outfits-pressing-engage-rape-fantasies.html

On September 2, the FBI released a report stating that Huma Abedin had claimed that a laptop containing email had been lost in the mail.

http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/09/02/hillary-clinton-s-team-lost-a-laptop-full-of-her-emails-in-the-actual-mail.html

On September 22, it was reported that a subpoena had been issued to Anthony Weiner for his cell phone. It was further reported that both the FBI and the NYPD had opened investigations into the sexting activities of the disgraced former congressman. 

http://www.dailydot.com/layer8/anthony-weiner-underage-sexts-subpoena/

On September 29, Huma Abedin announced she was splitting up 
with Anthony Weiner.

http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/08/29/calling-quits-huma-abedin-announces-decision-split-anthony-weiner/

In a report dated October 29, the New York Times stated that the FBI seized a laptop, an iPad, and a cell phone from Anthony Weiner. The laptop contained e-mails sent and received by Huma Abedin and other Clinton officials. The Times reported that the Justice Department and the FBI had only recently agreed to seek a warrant before reading the emails. Nevertheless, the Times also reported that law enforcement officials confirmed that Huma Abedin was receiving or sending at least some of the emails, and that some of the emails dated back years.

http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/30/us/politics/comey-clinton-email-justice.html?smid=tw-share

To ""seize"" a laptop, the FBI would have required a warrant.
On Friday, October 28, FBI Director James Comey wrote to several US congressional committees to inform them that the FBI had ""learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation."" 

http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/misc/2016/10/28/Comey_Letter-Oct28.pdf (Link to PDF)

In the letter, Comey went on to say that ""the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps. . . to determine whether they contain classified information. . . ."" 

Can the FBI look at the emails under the previous warrant or subpoena? Probably not as the scope would have been limited to the Weiner sexting investigation.

Can the FBI look at the emails with the consent of Anthony Weiner? He is said to be cooperating. 

http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/anthony-weiner-cooperating-with-fbi-on-email-probe/article/2606004#refresh-1

Probably not, because Weiner and Abedin are still married, and spousal privilege might apply. 

If both Weiner and Abedin cooperate, they could look at the laptop without a new warrant.

Thus, even with Weiner's cooperation, if Abedin does not likewise cooperate, the FBI will need a new warrant to look at the emails. 

The FBI has already looked at some of the emails during the sexting investigation. The FBI thus knows some of the content of the email.

Furthermore, the NYPD special victims investigations division has probably looked through many of the emails already.

What are the key rumors regarding these emails?

First, the FBI believes that some may contain classified information. 

Second, the Wall Street Journal has reported that there are 650,000 emails.

http://www.wsj.com/articles/laptop-may-include-thousands-of-emails-linked-to-hillary-clintons-private-server-1477854957

Third, we have the rumor floated that the emails were found in a folder titled ""life insurance."" This rumor is not sourced.

https://twitter.com/MorganBrittany4/status/792452710243020800 

This would indicate that the emails were being held as blackmail or to counter a threat to the life of Anthony Weiner, Huma Abedin, and/or their child. The question then becomes whether this ""life insurance"" was being held by Anthony Weiner, by Huma Abedin or by both. This is just a rumor at this point. We don't have any confirmation of it.

Fourth, Huma Abedin has apparently--in some kind of a statement--pleaded ignorance for how the emails got on to the laptop. Huma Abedin has been dropped from the Hillary Clinton campaign. She is lawyering up.

http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3886250/Huma-Abedin-holed-New-York-home-day-FBI-reopens-case-against-Clinton.html

Meanwhile, the FBI has been intensively investigating the Clinton Foundation for months.

http://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/10/30/clinton-foundation-fbi-investigation-confirmed-former-assistant-fbi-director/

(Additionally, see wsj.com link, above)

&gt;**EXCLUSIVE:** Resignation letters piling up from disaffected FBI agents, his wife urging him to admit he was wrong: **Why Director Comey jumped at the chance to reopen Hillary investigation.**

&gt;'James Comey revived the investigation of Clinton's email server as he could no longer resist mounting pressure by mutinous agents,' sources say.

&gt;The atmosphere at the FBI has been toxic ever since Jim announced last July that he wouldn't recommend an indictment against Hillary.

&gt;**He told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents.**

&gt;**Comey was also worried that Republicans would accuse him of granting Hillary political favoritism after the presidential election.**

&gt;When new emails allegedly linked to Hillary's personal server turned up in  Abedin and Anthony Weiner's computer, Comey jumped at the excuse. 
         
&gt;'Some people, including department heads, stopped talking to Jim, and even ignored his greetings when they passed him in the hall,' said the source. 'They felt that he betrayed them and brought disgrace on the bureau by letting Hillary off with a slap on the wrist.'

&gt;According to the source, 'Comey fretted over the problem for months and discussed it at great length with his wife, Patrice.'
	              
&gt;He told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents. The letters reminded him every day that morale in the FBI had hit rock bottom. He's been ignoring the resignation letters in the hope that he could find a way of remedying the situation,' said the source. 


&gt;When new emails that appeared to be related to Hillary's personal email server turned up in a computer used [her close aide] Huma Abedin and [Abedin's disgraced husband,] Anthony Weiner, Comey jumped at the excuse to reopen the investigation.

&gt;**The people he trusts the most have been the angriest at him,'** the source continued. **'And that includes his wife, Pat. She kept urging him to admit that he had been wrong when he refused to press charges against the former secretary of state.**
		
&gt;His announcement about the revived investigation, which came just 11 days before the presidential election, was greeted with shock and dismay by Attorney General Loretta Lynch and the prosecutors at the Justice Department. 'Jim told me that Lynch and Obama are furious with him,' the source said.

&gt;As I revealed in my latest New York Times bestseller, *Guilty As Sin*, Obama said that appointing Comey as FBI director was 'my worst mistake as president.'

&gt;'Lynch and Obama haven't contacted Jim directly,' said the source, 'but they've made it crystal clear through third parties that they disapprove of his effort to save face.'

&gt;*New York Times bestselling author Ed Klein has just published his fourth book about the Clintons since 2005, Guilty as Sin.* 

&gt;*Klein had told how Bill Clinton enjoyed foot rubs, massages and romps in his presidential library with female interns and has described new details about Hillary's medical crises. Guilty as Sin is available in bookstores and for order from Amazon.*"

I have gaps in my work history for IT work but I have a strong knowledge and foundation in the field. 

I went to a technical college in 2010 for a year and got hands on experience with help desk support, networking and computer repair. I earned my CompTia A+ and Net+ after completing the course.

My work experience is a 6 month doing help desk support, a paid 6 month internship doing integrated systems design/IT Support, and 2 years doing IT Support for a small business.

I've been doing electrical and construction for the last few years and I want to get back into the field. My certifications are from 2009 before you had to renew them every three years(I was told). I would still like to be current though. What entry level jobs should I be searching for? Should I be studying in home labs for my CCNA? Just looking for some guidance. "
5a9zwj,1,2016-10-30,"Worried, lost, and confused about relationship with my BF",asmrgurll,Relationship,https://www.reddit.com/r/Relationship/comments/5a9zwj/worried_lost_and_confused_about_relationship_with/,"So I (28/F) had meet my now boyfriend (37/M) on Tinder. We initially started texting for about a week before our first date. We really hit it off through text and had a great first date. 

We could talk for hours on end and just seemed to have this amazing connection with one another. Just being by him felt comfortable and right. He even mentioned feeling all of those things first without me even mentioning what I thought. 

We continued to date. He is pretty close with his family and I ended up meeting most of his family members and friends at a family celebration maybe not even a month into dating. 

Fast forward about a couple of months later and he asks me to be his GF. I told him yes and everything continued the way they were with us being a couple. 

Maybe two months in to us dating he meet my family. Or the ones who live in the current state I live in. My sister and brother in law. My family seemed to get along with him and really liked him. And from what I could tell his family and friends felt the same way about me. 

He has his own apartment and is a graduate student in the last semester working on completing his second Masters degree. He currently doesn't work and is only in school and doing a part time internship for the time being. 

He does drink a lot. Every day. And we use to be playful and tease each other by calling each other names a little or laughing together if either one of us did something funny like trip or any other harmless mistake. 

After a while at night there were some times that he would excessively call me names claiming he was just playing around. I mentioned that I didn't like it and sometimes he lightened up on it other times he kept on doing it. 

I assume it was due to him drinking and losing any ability to filter himself. Overall he doesn't seem like a jerk (though can be annoying at times when he isn't sober.) aside from that he always seemed caring and concerned with me and with other people in his life. 

He isn't perfect but I do believe that he is a good guy. He would still carry my bags if I spent the night at his place. Often times pay for food if we ordered in or went out. Though sometimes I'd help pay or pay for things as well when I was able to. 

He seemed concerned about how I felt, my overall well being when I was with him. And even would try to get to know more about me or ask me about my day. We were always very open and honest with each other. It just felt something that was safe and natural to do. 

If I told him something painful that happened in my past he seemed very understanding and I was the exact same way with him. If he ever did something that made me sad he would hold me and even a couple of times cry. Telling me that the last thing he wanted to do was hurt me or lose me. 

He would constantly give me compliments and tell me things like he liked the sound of my voice or my eyes, my hair. The flow of our conversation. Etc. I always thought especially in the start of a relationship you are suppose to let the man take the lead when it came down to pursuing you. 

I often times would wait and let him text first or make the plans even if it was just us hanging out at his place. There were a few times he told me he didn't think that I was really into him. I said that wasn't the case and that I liked him a lot. And was attracted to him. 

All things that were completely true. From what he said I took that as he felt I didn't show him enough interest as he wanted, and that he might have been feeling a bit insecure. Both of which he told me were true. 

So afterwards I tried making him feel wanted. Nothing excessive. But say for example if he didn't text me all day, instead of giving him the lead to do that. At times I would text first. Or I would try to be more affectionate. Things like rubbing his neck or arm. Cuddling with him when we were on the couch or kissing his neck. 

All things he really seemed to enjoy. He was always a man of his word and never canceled plans with me. Last Thursday he asked if I wanted to hang out on and spend the night with him on Friday. I said yes. A couple of days before that one of his Dad's cars that he had been borrowing had been towed. He accidentally parked it on the street at a time he wasn't suppose to. 

In addition to hanging out and spending the night on Friday, originally I was going to drive over on Thursday to take him to the police impound near him to get the car. He does also have his own car might I add, but the tags are currently expired so I tend to do most of the driving whenever we go some place. 

On Thursday we made plans for me to come over around 3:30 or so. He usually has trouble sleeping at night and often times will rest throughout the day when he can. I live around 15-20 minutes away from him. So that day I got ready to go, ordered a coffee online and was going to head on out , pick it up then go get him to get his Dad's impounded car. 

A few minutes before I was ready to leave my place maybe about a little after 3 he texts me, saying he was still pretty tired and let's make it 4:45. It isn't abnormal for us to push things to a later time, especially with him typically being tired. And I admit I tend to arrive a bit later then I say I will most of the time. Usually by 10-15 minutes or so. 

After he text me I texted back that I did have things to do that day and what if we made it 3:45 ish instead of 4:45. I also didn't want to deal with rush hour traffic afterwards on my drive back home. After his text to change the agreed upon time when I asked about 3:45 instead I here nothing back from him. 

I tried texting and even calling him to confirm if 3:45 or so instead of 4:45 would work for him. But he never replied. I texted him I was on my way to pick up my coffee that I ordered. Maybe a block or two away from my apartment, and that if I didn't hear back from him within ten minutes or so after getting my drink, we would have to arrange another time to get his Dad's car. 

Got my coffee, tried texting and calling him and still no answer. I assume from as well as I know him now he had just gone back to sleep after texting me and didn't hear my texts or calls. Not unlike him to not hear the phone. Once recently, we were suppose to meet his parents for dinner. I got to his place in enough time to pick him up and drive to the restaurant. 

When I arrived and tried texting and calling to let him know I was waiting downstairs he didn't respond. He lives in an apartment building that in order to get inside of the building you need a key. Which I don't have. Luckily after trying to reach him for a few minutes someone was leaving the building and let me inside. 

I went up to his apartment and knocked on the door. No answer. Banged on it and could hear his TV going. Finally I heard him getting up and he opened the door. He had set an alarm on his phone so he could take a nap for about an hour and it didn't go off. 

We had to call and arrange to meet his parents 30 minutes later then we had originally planned. Luckily they hadn't left there house yet so it wasn't a problem. 

So my point is that he does tend to do stuff like over sleeping. Back to what happened on Thursday. So after getting my coffee and driving back to my place I finally get a text from him around 4:20. He apologized and said he feel asleep. Earlier when I wasn't getting a response from him I texted, let's just make it another day. That Friday would probably work better anyways. 

My sister (who lives maybe a couple of miles from him) had talked with me about possible hanging out for a bit on Friday. So when he was asleep and missed my texts I said it would be better because I would be in the area and that we were going to spend the night together and in between getting the car and hanging out later on, I maybe would see my sister for a bit. 

He said that was fine and no worries, that would work. Besides he had been really tired lately more then usual. So on Friday I leave my place a bit after 3ish. Get to his place to pick him up so he could get his Dad's car from the impound lot. 

We go there and I wait with him. He was hoping not to upset his Dad and try to take care of it without him finding out, but was unable to. So while we were there he called his Dad and told him what happened with the car. His Dad had to come by because they would only release it to the person who owned the car. 

His Dad shows up, we all wait a bit and then after his Dad shows proof of ownership his Dad leaves to drive home. My BF and I wait there for a bit longer. Over all it was close to two hours that we were there. I had tried to rub his leg a little on the way over and he told me not to. I assume he just wasn't in the mood and was a bit upset about the whole ordeal. 

While we were there he was texting on his phone a lot. He has joked once before when I was on my phone. Saying what are you texting your other guy. And I wasn't and mentioned that at the time. I asked him who he was texting so much and he said his brother. 

When he finally got his Dad's car he suggested that I follow him over to his parents place since I still hadn't heard back from my sister about hanging out. We both drove separately to his parents place. 

He parked his Dad's car there, and we went inside for a little bit. He got some laundry (his Mom washes his clothes for him because he doesn't have a washer or dryer.) said goodbye to his family. They thanked me for helping take him to get the car and my bf and I left in my car. 

I figured that we would probably just head back to his place. He had to take an online test for a class that night. He has taken it a few times before and I usually just let him focus on that and keep myself busy by reading and or doing something on my phone. 

Before getting back to his place he mentioned how his laptop had stopped working and asked if I minded if we stopped at a nearby store so he could run in and get another before driving back to his place. I said that was fine and wanted to stop by the mall to run in and get something which he was alright with me doing. 

I figured since I was in the area why not take care of that anyways. So we go to the mall. He waits in the car and I run inside and get what I wanted and come back about ten minutes or so later. From the mall I drive him to the store to get his laptop. 

After that he asked if I minded stoping at a sandwich shop on the way back which we did. We both got something to eat and headed for his place. Once we were getting off the freeway he asks what I had planned for the night. I told him I thought we were going to spend the night together. And he said, he wasn't feeling too good plus he needed to focus on taking his test. 

I asked him why he didn't mention changing his mind about me coming over earlier that day. To me it almost seemed like he just made me think that we would hang out so I would drive him around. Or changed his mind for whatever reason and was worried that I wouldn't if he canceled on me. 

I asked him why he hadn't told me and that he gave me the impression that was what we were going to do and that I had even packed my over night bag. He said well, I have been really tired lately. I mean I would have you come over but I want to be able to focus on my test. I mean if you could still go over to your sister's while I took it you could come over after. 

It was close to 8 at night. My sister and brother in law have a 7 year old child and 8PM is normally her bed time. My niece tends to want to spend time with me whenever I'm there and they have trouble getting her to bed if I'm there past her bed time. 

I explained that to him. And he said he was sorry he just needed to take the test. That the next day on Saturday we could go over to his parents house and have dinner there, together with them, his brother, there kid and his brothers fiancé. As he was getting out of my car he said don't be mad. Gave me a hug, got out and went inside. 

I drove back to my place. I felt very disappointed, disrespected maybe even a little bit used. But tried to give him the benefit of the doubt. Maybe he really wasn't feeling good, was upset about having to go through the whole car getting towed and ending up having his Dad find out. So maybe he just needed some time alone. 

Once before when I was spending the night with him and he had been drinking as usual I came back from smoking a cigarette downstairs to find him on his laptop on OK cupid. I asked him about it then and told him I was upset. He said well I hate that you smoke and it was a joke. I told him it wasn't funny and he said he was sorry and wouldn't do it again. 

I had gone online to see his OK cupid profile a few days or so later. I was browsing (didn't create my own profile or anything) and was shocked and hurt that he had logged on recently days after telling me it was a joke and he wouldn't do it anymore. 

I never asked him again about it. We would hang out and talk a great deal, go out, spend time with his family, and things like that. I assumed with all that everything was fine. But in the back of my mind I had doubts. I checked periodically and noticed he would log on to OK cupid quite a bit. 

I couldn't understand completely what was going on. It wasn't as though we were just casually dating, we were together. I assumed if he wanted to see truly see other people he would just tell me that. Being on the dating site and the fact that many times he would be texting on his phone a great deal made me wonder if he wasn't talking or trying to date other people. 

What confuses me about the whole time is up until recently he has acted as though everything was alright between us. We have disagreed a few times before, but always ended up working it out. He had mentioned he didn't like me smoking cigs and I have been and even told him I was working on cutting back with the intention of quitting. Which he seemed happy to hear. 

Friday night after I got home he told me his new laptop wasn't working and that he wouldn't be able to take the test by the time it was due that night. I asked if he could mention his problem to his professor and see about retaking it or if she would allow him to do extra credit or something. 

He said he was pretty sure she would let him retake it. So the next day on Saturday I go about my business. He doesn't text me at all the entire day. Around 7 or so that night I finally text him. And ask him what he was up to. He said he was at his parents. Didn't bring up anything about having me come over that night to have dinner with him and his family or anything. 

I asked him how he was doing. Figuring maybe he was still tired or sick as he said he was for a few days. Or thought he may have still been not feeling good after dealing with his Dad's car getting towed. 

He text back his was alright. Never asked how I was or what I was doing or anything like he normally does. I asked if he ever got his laptop working and he replied with no and that he was going to return it on Sunday. Any question I asked he responded with a brief almost close ended answer. 

I figured maybe he was still feeling upset about everything and didn't text back that night. I thought about how he did what he did on Sunday, how he seemed more distant lately when we were together, blew me off on Saturday, canceled plans at the last minute on Friday. Plus the fact he was texting less, seemed not to want to even text me on Saturday and seemed more interested in texting on his phone on Friday then even really talking or being around me when I was there. 

So I got on and checked his OK cupid profile Saturday. He had logged on shortly before I texted him Saturday night. I assume if in fact his new laptop wasn't working he maybe either stopped at his computer lab at his University (he sometimes has a morning class there on Saturday) or maybe he logged on his Mom's computer as he sometimes does when he is at his Parent's. (His Iphone was damaged maybe 2-3 months ago and he still has a flip phone. So no way to get online from that) 

I checked periodically Saturday night and again a couple times today (Sunday) The last I checked it said he hadn't logged back on. Now it is almost 8 at night here and he hasn't tried contacting me at all. Which before the last couple days is unusual for him. Normally he texts or sometimes even calls me either in the day time or at least in the evening. One day I hadn't heard from him at all but he contacted me the very next day. 

Now I am completely lost on what is going on. I don't know if he is losing interest in me, looking for or found someone else. And instead of telling me he is just slowly ghosting me. (Before him I dated someone who did that after just 3-4 months of dating) Or is it he just has been having a rough time lately and wants to be alone. I hope and figure if he has lost interest and has moved on he would tell me and not just disappear. He still has a couple of towels of mine, body wash and some other similar hygienic products of mine that I have been keeping at his place. 


Nothing of great value, but I'd imagine if things were over between us he would at least have me come get my things. Then again maybe if they are he won't there is no telling. And that isn't currently my main concern. I'm worried that he doesn't want to be with me and or found someone else. 

Yesterday (Saturday) I was feeling very sad. I tried to do household chores a bit, worked out in my apartment a little and even did a bit of online work. (I work from home) I watched TV, relaxed. And did my best to try and not let it bother me. But it was difficult to do as much as I would have liked. Instead I tended to just sit there a bit lost in my feelings of being upset, uncertain and worried. 

Before bed I took a shower, and cried a little. I thought about how sometimes I let fear and worry of what might happen or even dwell on negative things from my past get in my way more then I should. That it is alright to acknowledge my emotions. But not control me or my life as much. And not even just with my BF but with anything. 

I realized that in addition to that sometimes I am a bit anxious about the future. Just anything in general. That I might think of goals I might have, like getting in shape for example or others things and instead of trying to figure out a plan and taking action. I will sometimes delay working on it and figure out how long it could take to reach the goal if I worked on 30 minutes most day, then an hour, two hours etc. 

And while it is one thing to figure out steps I can take to make it happen I should focus more on working on the steps instead of dragging my feet. That If I figured out what it would take to make something happen I would just get started. And if I ended up reaching the goal faster then great. If not at least I'd be working on it instead of wasting time. 

So today (Sunday) I woke up and tried focusing on some of my goals to improve my life. Like decluttering my place and even working out a little. It took my mind off of being upset with my BF and I was able to get a lot done. 

Now I am still lost and deeply concerned on what is going on in my relationship. I feel so upset and alone. Part of me just wants to cry and then get ready for bed. But I don't know what to do. I have read before that it is normal for guys to pull back a little and it is best to give them space. 

But I don't know if that is the best way of dealing with it or if that is even what is happening. I feel lost, confused, and so overwhelmed with it all. 

What do you think is happening with him? Why might he be getting on an online dating site? Could he just need space, is just patiently waiting and giving him that the best way to go about it? What could I do now, and how can I feel better?

We had to call and arrange to meet his parents 30 minutes later then we had originally planned. Luckily they hadn't left there house yet so it wasn't a problem. 


So my point is that he does tend to do stuff like over sleeping. Back to what happened on Thursday. So after getting my coffee and driving back to my place I finally get a text from him around 4:20. He apologized and said he feel asleep. Earlier when I wasn't getting a response from him I texted, let's just make it another day. That Friday would probably work better anyways. 


My sister (who lives maybe a couple of miles from him) had talked with me about possible hanging out for a bit on Friday. So when he was asleep and missed my texts I said it would be better because I would be in the area and that we were going to spend the night together and in between getting the car and hanging out later on, I maybe would see my sister for a bit. 


He said that was fine and no worries, that would work. Besides he had been really tired lately more then usual. So on Friday I leave my place a bit after 3ish. Get to his place to pick him up so he could get his Dad's car from the impound lot. 


We go there and I wait with him. He was hoping not to upset his Dad and try to take care of it without him finding out, but was unable to. So while we were there he called his Dad and told him what happened with the car. His Dad had to come by because they would only release it to the person who owned the car. 


His Dad shows up, we all wait a bit and then after his Dad shows proof of ownership his Dad leaves to drive home. My BF and I wait there for a bit longer. Over all it was close to two hours that we were there. I had tried to rub his leg a little on the way over and he told me not to. I assume he just wasn't in the mood and was a bit upset about the whole ordeal. 


While we were there he was texting on his phone a lot. He has joked once before when I was on my phone. Saying what are you texting your other guy. And I wasn't and mentioned that at the time. I asked him who he was texting so much and he said his brother. 


When he finally got his Dad's car he suggested that I follow him over to his parents place since I still hadn't heard back from my sister about hanging out. We both drove separately to his parents place. 


He parked his Dad's car there, and we went inside for a little bit. He got some laundry (his Mom washes his clothes for him because he doesn't have a washer or dryer.) said goodbye to his family. They thanked me for helping take him to get the car and my bf and I left in my car. 


I figured that we would probably just head back to his place. He had to take an online test for a class that night. He has taken it a few times before and I usually just let him focus on that and keep myself busy by reading and or doing something on my phone. 


Before getting back to his place he mentioned how his laptop had stopped working and asked if I minded if we stopped at a nearby store so he could run in and get another before driving back to his place. I said that was fine and wanted to stop by the mall to run in and get something which he was alright with me doing. 


I figured since I was in the area why not take care of that anyways. So we go to the mall. He waits in the car and I run inside and get what I wanted and come back about ten minutes or so later. From the mall I drive him to the store to get his laptop. 


After that he asked if I minded stoping at a sandwich shop on the way back which we did. We both got something to eat and headed for his place. Once we were getting off the freeway he asks what I had planned for the night. I told him I thought we were going to spend the night together. And he said, he wasn't feeling too good plus he needed to focus on taking his test. 


I asked him why he didn't mention changing his mind about me coming over earlier that day. To me it almost seemed like he just made me think that we would hang out so I would drive him around. Or changed his mind for whatever reason and was worried that I wouldn't if he canceled on me. 


I asked him why he hadn't told me and that he gave me the impression that was what we were going to do and that I had even packed my over night bag. He said well, I have been really tired lately. I mean I would have you come over but I want to be able to focus on my test. I mean if you could still go over to your sister's while I took it you could come over after. 


It was close to 8 at night. My sister and brother in law have a 7 year old child and 8PM is normally her bed time. My niece tends to want to spend time with me whenever I'm there and they have trouble getting her to bed if I'm there past her bed time. 


I explained that to him. And he said he was sorry he just needed to take the test. That the next day on Saturday we could go over to his parents house and have dinner there, together with them, his brother, there kid and his brothers fiancé. As he was getting out of my car he said don't be mad. Gave me a hug, got out and went inside. 


I drove back to my place. I felt very disappointed, disrespected maybe even a little bit used. But tried to give him the benefit of the doubt. Maybe he really wasn't feeling good, was upset about having to go through the whole car getting towed and ending up having his Dad find out. So maybe he just needed some time alone. 


Once before when I was spending the night with him and he had been drinking as usual I came back from smoking a cigarette downstairs to find him on his laptop on OK cupid. I asked him about it then and told him I was upset. He said well I hate that you smoke and it was a joke. I told him it wasn't funny and he said he was sorry and wouldn't do it again. 


I had gone online to see his OK cupid profile a few days or so later. I was browsing (didn't create my own profile or anything) and was shocked and hurt that he had logged on recently days after telling me it was a joke and he wouldn't do it anymore. 


I never asked him again about it. We would hang out and talk a great deal, go out, spend time with his family, and things like that. I assumed with all that everything was fine. But in the back of my mind I had doubts. I checked periodically and noticed he would log on to OK cupid quite a bit. 


I couldn't understand completely what was going on. It wasn't as though we were just casually dating, we were together. I assumed if he wanted to see truly see other people he would just tell me that. Being on the dating site and the fact that many times he would be texting on his phone a great deal made me wonder if he wasn't talking or trying to date other people. 


What confuses me about the whole time is up until recently he has acted as though everything was alright between us. We have disagreed a few times before, but always ended up working it out. He had mentioned he didn't like me smoking cigs and I have been and even told him I was working on cutting back with the intention of quitting. Which he seemed happy to hear. 


Friday night after I got home he told me his new laptop wasn't working and that he wouldn't be able to take the test by the time it was due that night. I asked if he could mention his problem to his professor and see about retaking it or if she would allow him to do extra credit or something. 


He said he was pretty sure she would let him retake it. So the next day on Saturday I go about my business. He doesn't text me at all the entire day. Around 7 or so that night I finally text him. And ask him what he was up to. He said he was at his parents. Didn't bring up anything about having me come over that night to have dinner with him and his family or anything. 


I asked him how he was doing. Figuring maybe he was still tired or sick as he said he was for a few days. Or thought he may have still been not feeling good after dealing with his Dad's car getting towed. 


He text back his was alright. Never asked how I was or what I was doing or anything like he normally does. I asked if he ever got his laptop working and he replied with no and that he was going to return it on Sunday. Any question I asked he responded with a brief almost close ended answer. 


I figured maybe he was still feeling upset about everything and didn't text back that night. I thought about how he did what he did on Sunday, how he seemed more distant lately when we were together, blew me off on Saturday, canceled plans at the last minute on Friday. Plus the fact he was texting less, seemed not to want to even text me on Saturday and seemed more interested in texting on his phone on Friday then even really talking or being around me when I was there. 


So I got on and checked his OK cupid profile Saturday. He had logged on shortly before I texted him Saturday night. I assume if in fact his new laptop wasn't working he maybe either stopped at his computer lab at his University (he sometimes has a morning class there on Saturday) or maybe he logged on his Mom's computer as he sometimes does when he is at his Parent's. (His Iphone was damaged maybe 2-3 months ago and he still has a flip phone. So no way to get online from that) 


I checked periodically Saturday night and again a couple times today (Sunday) The last I checked it said he hadn't logged back on. Now it is almost 8 at night here and he hasn't tried contacting me at all. Which before the last couple days is unusual for him. Normally he texts or sometimes even calls me either in the day time or at least in the evening. One day I hadn't heard from him at all but he contacted me the very next day. 


Now I am completely lost on what is going on. I don't know if he is losing interest in me, looking for or found someone else. And instead of telling me he is just slowly ghosting me. (Before him I dated someone who did that after just 3-4 months of dating) Or is it he just has been having a rough time lately and wants to be alone. I hope and figure if he has lost interest and has moved on he would tell me and not just disappear. He still has a couple of towels of mine, body wash and some other similar hygienic products of mine that I have been keeping at his place. 


Nothing of great value, but I'd imagine if things were over between us he would at least have me come get my things. Then again maybe if they are he won't there is no telling. And that isn't currently my main concern. I'm worried that he doesn't want to be with me and or found someone else. 

Now I am still lost and deeply concerned on what is going on in my relationship. I feel so upset and alone. Part of me just wants to cry and then get ready for bed. But I don't know what to do. I have read before that it is normal for guys to pull back a little and it is best to give them space. 


But I don't know if that is the best way of dealing with it or if that is even what is happening. I feel lost, confused, and so overwhelmed with it all. 


TL;DR: What do you think is happening with him? Why might he be getting on an online dating site? Could he just need space, is just patiently waiting and giving him that the best way to go about it? What could I do now, and how can I feel better?

5aaf05,1,2016-10-31,CA question about Medi-cal and reporting income,kbforthree,Insurance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/5aaf05/ca_question_about_medical_and_reporting_income/,"Help! I am concerned that my inaction in reporting new income while on Medi-cal is going to be a problem. I just received a notice in the mail about needing to check my eligibility in order to continue coverage and need some advice. Here's the situation from the beginning...

I initially joined Medi-cal through the San Mateo Health Plan in 2012 when my dad died when I was 22. I spent the next couple years working minimum wage as an intern so the income limit was never really an issue. I actually tried to get on Covered CA in 2014 because I had a few serious medical problems (IBS, ADD, depression) that Medi-cal didn't cover but I didn't make enough to qualify.

In late 2014 I got a full-time job that came with Aetna health insurance, and I just assumed that the Medi-cal wouldn't renew so I didn't cancel it. As it turned out, I never got kicked off Medi-cal.
How do I know? Because when I got laid off a year later, and I was now living in San Francisco, I was able to update my Medi-cal plan to the San Francisco Health Plan. During this time I spent a few months on SDI (before getting laid off) and then later UI.

Starting in 2015, I have been working a new full-time job – that does not offer health insurance – for nearly two years now making more than the income maximum and I still have the Medi-cal coverage. I thought it would end last year when I ignored the renewal notices, but nope, I still have coverage.

I just received another notice in the mail for this year, and am wondering if I don't reply if I will keep my coverage again. I've read that there can be a penalty for not reporting income changes, but don't know how strict the penalty is. I have had some serious health issues these past few years that Medi-cal has covered completely and until recently I was concerned that I would unable to keep a job because of these issues, so that is the main reason I never reported my new income. I am much healthier now and am less concerned about my illnesses getting in the way of keeping a job.

I'm wondering if I should not respond and hope to keep Medi-cal coverage for next year or proactively cancel the coverage and start paying Covered CA? Also, should I be concerned about having to pay for anything Medi-cal covered over the last year?"
5ab8rg,2,2016-10-31,What should I do about my dating life?,PSS4Ely,dating,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/5ab8rg/what_should_i_do_about_my_dating_life/,"        I'm 19 years old and after a few relationships I messed up in high school and after taking a couple of years off the dating scene, I now have an issue. I used to be surrounded by girls everyday (back in high school) but now I'm in a situation where there really isn't an girls to meet. I usually have around a range of 2-5 coworkers and at school (I dont go to university or a quote on quote college I go to film school) there isn't really anything there. Of my 2-5 coworkers who have a cap of working 3 months before leaving (non paid internship) . Since I started working there 18 months ago, only 3 of those months I landed a chill girl, but I could tell weren't interested in a relationship (2 of them are the one night stand type the other just wanted to be friends). Most of the time I'm unlucky with women coworkers. They are usually older than me by a few years, have a boyfriend, or look like they don't even try. And even if I do land a chill girl, I really only get to become friends with her (get her number and stuff and never talk again due to irrelevancies and not knowing each other well enough) .
           So it's rare to find a woman in the workplace. I'm at this age that right now woman are going to be generally older than me and I kind of have to cope with it. My workplace demographic is 21-30. I have been working there since May 2015 at age 17 because my parents own the company. As for college I am generally surrounded by guys, since it is film. Mind you there is still a decent amount of women, but the class size is 30 and you see the same exact people every single month. Occasionally new people who take leaves of absence join your group, but it doesn't happen much. There's only like 5 or 6 girls in my class of 30. And they are just not my type. So basically I'm just stuck on where to meet women. I got 5 women that are not attractive and have ego issues until I graduate, praying that soon a hot girl will enter our class before graduating next june. I got interns every 3 months and usually unlucky with that.. I have a tinder and bumble account, but can't get matches. Even if I did get a match, I'm one of those people who can't drive and have to take public transit/uber everywhere so it would be a struggle. With the driving I assure you nothing else can be done, I just have to wait for self driving cars. 4 Years of practice is way too long, and I learned when I was 16 I have a severe case of ADHD and perscritons like adderal had bad side effects on me. So I basically walk a lot and take the bus a lot. I had to terminate my credit card so no uber (dont want to go into details why). 
            I honestly dont really plan on using tinder or bumble. So I mean I'm kind of just stuck. I would really like to have some more experience dating so that I can find a deep bond moving forward. The last relationship thing I had I blew it. The girl threw herself at me, had an amazing personality, but I just felt scared. I lacked confidence due to my past rejections, being bullied, insecurities,etc.  It wasn't until she found someone who looked and acted very similar like me that I felt great regret. I haven't been in a relationship since. I'm not 21 yet so I can't go to the bars. I don't really have friends because my coworkers leave every 3 months (most are from out of state) and with my college mates this was my 4th group since enrolling in August 2015. I've been in different groups due to leaves of absense, and I can't really establish a bond. I mean I still talk to high school friends occasionally and I do have a best friend but he is currently living out of my state. I used to have a local friend but he did some shady stuff. So I've been kind of alone since high school, spending my days at school and work, but mostly at home playing video games and watching TV or youtube. I have no idea what to do. 
            I even had this crazy idea of playing college football after I graduate in June just so I can meet girls, get in shape, get friends, and that tiny chance of working within the realms of football (coach, agent, reporter, or even nfl player). I played football in high school and I'm most certain I can make a college team. I was good but I never considered making it my career. It wasn't until recently that I found out football was something I was really passionate about and the lifestyle too. I just got to finish my degree in June. Would it be worth going to play college football to rekindle that fire and getting rid of my depression worth it? I tell you it's depressing letting a girl like that slip through your hands, your friends never wanting to talk or hang out anymore, not doing things you love anymore, it's hard to transition form high school to college. I spent the last 2 years alone. What I need right now is a woman to help guide my life back to the right direction. Whew that was a long post. Kudos if you made it this far! Let me know what you guys think I should do. Thanks!"

Is adding an IT minor worth it now, how many courses does that involve?

I literally just need to make it to january. 

I have a full-time, paid internship in the spring, so I literally just need to try and stretch what I have now till January and then Between January-August I'll be full-time employed in my field before I even graduate (aw yiss). Unfortunately, in order to complete that I went into super-broke mode and spent all my time on my portfolio instead of doing my online gig. It was soul sucking, not using my major, and for... a niche community I didn't want anything to do with anymore. Its like the stripper version of artists. Easy money, but hollow. I quit that and got my finances fucked up because an auto-draft bill dind't go through when it was supposed to, and it was like a 20 car pile-up from there. 

I make about $400 a month and that's barely enough to cover my bills. I'm behind on my wifi and I want to tackle the 30% interest CC debt (snowball) but I've already sold everything of value I have. All I have left is my scanner, my tablet, my laptop and my phone, all of which I need for daily commute, work, school, and gigs.

I got a 2015 MacbookPro in February in a pinch when my last machine died during finals week, and I'm now looking at getting a Dell XPS 15 with better specs than the MBP. I got it brand new at 2.2k, if I sell it for 1.8k and then buy a new Dell at 1.3k, I could use the 500 to get ahead on some stuff. You know, pay on principle. Is that a good idea?

My son is only 9 months old, and we weren't planning on trying for a second for another year. I was on oral contraceptives and I took my pill every day. I don't know how this happened. 

My husband is in his second year of residency, and after having our first baby during his intern year he really didn't want to go through that again. He doesn't feel like he's going to get to be around for this kid either, and that breaks my heart. He's a really good dad and he wants to spend more time with our son as it is, but his hours are crazy. 

So now it's about 36 hours after I took the test, and I'm just freaked out. About paying for daycare for two babies, fitting them into our house, telling my work, my husband's schedule, not getting more time to just enjoy my son...about everything. I should be working but I'm just sitting here reminding myself that people do this and it's going to be OK. 

But I'm doing a terrible job convincing myself of that. So, kind strangers on the internet, can you guys tell me it's going to be OK? Your stories of survival would be really, really welcome right now.

5acvs5,0,2016-10-31,"Finance Major Passionate, but Confused on where to go from here...",financerdancer,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5acvs5/finance_major_passionate_but_confused_on_where_to/,"
I want to apologize for this wall of text but I needed to provide as much information as possible about my current situation to maybe get the most accurate information so here goes:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**MY STORY -** My love for finance, and numbers as they relate to money can really goes back as far as when I was in early grade school, I remember that the only way my mom could get me to understand addition and subtraction was to pull a couple of singles out of her purse and relate them to the numbers on the flash cards we had to study. As I reached middle school in 2008, I watched the world's economy collapse, which quickly fueled and ignited my passion for the world of finance in a desperate search to why these things ""just happen"" (as my 7th grade social studies teacher had given as an answer when I asked him why everyone was loosing their jobs and why everyone was in a frenzy). At about 12 I had decided to sacrifice any chance for a social life (whatever that was in middle school) to study just the basic economics I was capable of understanding at the time. It had paid off not only by providing me with more palatable answers than ""these things just happen sometimes"", but by showing me the true power of the forces of what I would later come to understand as being simply called ""Finance"". In late middle school early high school I ended up going through a VERY cringy period of time where I worshiped Ayn Rand (i.e. ""If drugs were easily and readily available and legal then less people would do them regardless of current addictions and deceptive marketing tactics"" (PM me for some more zingers I still have a whole notebook of them if you'd like)). This period of time I look back with mostly regret mostly because it didn't help me get a further understanding of Financial Concepts replacing every potential area of new understanding with DEREGULATE IT OBVIOUSLY or this would be easier, better, less risky if it weren't for big government. Although this time was somewhat of a personal ""dark age"" of financial understanding it still gave me an even clearer, albeit more romanticized image of why I loved the world of Finance. It was a world which was ruled by firms both big and small, government regulation, and the free market, but regardless of how big the firms or government got, or how unruly and unpredictable the market became it was a world controlled by an unrelenting god whose powers came through math and numbers, and whose image was displayed prominently on currency. It was in mid-high school that I had decided to turn the zeal, passion and what little knowledge I had into experience, and began to look for internships that would allow me to see the Financial Sides of private business, and it ended up being a success! While I hadn't been able to intern as much as I had hoped in the finance industry (the state I live in has only 1 private equity firm I believe to this day), I was still able to help a campaign finance company for one school year with their bookkeeping needs, work in a mid-sized micro-finance non-profit's grant writing and finance department, and even helped an environmental startup do its market research for a summer in exchange for books and supplies money for my first year of college.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With these experiences and the fact that I completed an associates in general studies during high school I honestly felt on top of the world as I saw my intangible passions and knowledge turn into actual progress and work in what I truly believed in. I had decided the Summer before attending my ""dream school"" at the time that without a doubt I was going to major in Finance (obviously), and was very excited and grateful that not only was the school I was about to attend an accredited business school, but I was going to attend on a full ride. I'm kind of tearing up a little as I type this, but these dreams and passions began to crumble at this school, and my first red flag was one of my first days as I got the opportunity to speak with a senior who held the same exact degree as I did. I remember still sitting nervously across from this giant man in my over-sized suit for my smaller build as he continued to droan on unenthusiastically about how he really wanted to do a major in sports, but the school no longer offered it and ""I guess that kind of led me to business, but my dad told me I had to have something more specific or I wouldn't find any good jobs"". I felt like my whole life's passion was kind of (for lack of a better term) ""shit all over"" as this man kind of just described it as a last resort to not be a bum. I remember swearing this off as just an unlucky, isolated experience with someone who picked the wrong major and nothing more than than that. A week after we were able to get settled in I was able to meet with my academic adviser to talk about my major, and potential directions I could go career-wise (this was a conversation typically reserved for juniors, but my associates degree transferred pretty smoothly giving me the official grade of a junior). It was during this meeting that my dreams were further kicked in the teeth as this man referred to finance as ""a more simplified version of accounting and is a more limited choice than say an accounting major"". I still remember asking him what he found most exciting about finance and I still remember his answer of ""well finance really can't be summarized easily because after spending all my years in business academia I've realized that finance really is no different than a child guessing which number he's about to roll on his dice with many more variables making it less predictable."" Aside from that fact that he really didn't answer my question, it once again made me hate myself for even considering having this as a passion. Looking back, this wasn't even a year ago, but it was probably the most unhappy I had ever been, and I was stuck 400 miles away with a crushed dream and my drive was gone entirely. The campus culture viewed me and my dreams as either ""nerdy and gay"" or ""non-progressive and ""contributed nothing to the liberal cause because it had nothing to do with helping marginalized groups"" (my family back home lived on food stamps and struggled to keep the lights on regularly). I had only kept my finance degree because I wasn't sure what else I had wanted to do because there never WAS ""anything else"" for me. After a year of working as a janitor in the school, just barely passing many of my classes, being essentially a loner, and feeling like what little family I had forgot I existed, I began to come very close to the verge of ending my life as I saw no real reason to continue moving on. I made an ultimatum with myself one day while hosing some vomit off the sidewalk near the frat house parking lot, that I needed to leave this place after my first year, and I needed to stop this being a victim type of life or else there was no real point to continue on.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Staying true to my word, I had decided to transfer to a school that was much closer to home and friends, was in a more urban atmosphere,
and was more focused on career experience, versus a ""well rounded liberal arts education"" the last school loved to advertise regularly. After my first month of classes here, I had realized that I had made the right choice in school as I had loved everything about how dedicated the school was to teaching the students actual career skills while still offering a formal education as well, not mention I'm kicking butt in all of my classes again which is a huge confidence boost. I had even gotten a better paying job than my janitorial duties of cleaning up alcohol and the after affects of alcohol as a part-time bookkeeper (now part-time cashier) at my local Home Depot. As much as I'm actually learning to love my life again, and am grateful to begin living it again I still have many questions about what to do next

**TL;DR:**

* Loved math and money since 1st grade
* Manifested itself into a quest to figure out what caused the recession in middle school
* This turned into a realization of the key element of finance within the recession
* Led to an cringy, unhealthy-ish love of Ayn Rand's teachings which caused a short pitfall, but a more romanticized image of the world of finance
* Took my passions for finance seriously and held multiple internships in relatively similar fields during high school
* Went to from city to small, rural, closed campus liberal arts university far away from home and had my dreams embarassingly crushed by skeptics and academia
* Went back homeward to a more supportive, career-driven school, and closer friends and family
* Have hit a strategy-block on what I'm supposed to do now if I want to jump back on a finance career track

***which brings me to my next part.....***

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT I SHOULD DO NEXT....**

1. As of now I am working a near-minimum wage job, and attending school full-time but how can I enter a potential internship that will better prepare me for a career in finance?

1. What are some good resources that I can join/look into that will better prepare me for entering the financial industry than I am now?

1. (If you read the story) what is something that I can do better/differently that I haven't been doing? Any critical feedback welcome

1. Are there any good ways of igniting this passion for finance that I once held again? (pep talks, movies, books, etc.)
ALSO if you don't mind sharing it, your own personal journey or a deep seeded question of your own you'd like to share in the comments :)

5adaes,4,2016-10-31,"Advice on what is happening with us. Me (28/F) him (37/M) Dating 4 1/2 months. Originally meet on Tinder. Had first date a week later, hit it off. Continued dating. 2 months or so into dating became his GF.",asmrgurll,wemetonline,https://www.reddit.com/r/wemetonline/comments/5adaes/advice_on_what_is_happening_with_us_me_28f_him/,"So I (28/F) had meet my now boyfriend (37/M) on Tinder. We initially started texting for about a week before our first date. We really hit it off through text and had a great first date. 

We could talk for hours on end and just seemed to have this amazing connection with one another. Just being by him felt comfortable and right. He even mentioned feeling all of those things first without me even mentioning what I thought. 

We continued to date. He is pretty close with his family and I ended up meeting most of his family members and friends at a family celebration maybe not even a month into dating. 

Fast forward about a couple of months later and he asks me to be his GF. I told him yes and everything continued the way they were with us being a couple. 

Maybe two months in to us dating he meet my family. Or the ones who live in the current state I live in. My sister and brother in law. My family seemed to get along with him and really liked him. And from what I could tell his family and friends felt the same way about me. 

He has his own apartment and is a graduate student in the last semester working on completing his second Masters degree. He currently doesn't work and is only in school and doing a part time internship for the time being. 

He does drink a lot. Every day. And we use to be playful and tease each other by calling each other names a little or laughing together if either one of us did something funny like trip or any other harmless mistake. 

After a while at night there were some times that he would excessively call me names claiming he was just playing around. I mentioned that I didn't like it and sometimes he lightened up on it other times he kept on doing it. 

I assume it was due to him drinking and losing any ability to filter himself. Overall he doesn't seem like a jerk (though can be annoying at times when he isn't sober.) aside from that he always seemed caring and concerned with me and with other people in his life. 

He isn't perfect but I do believe that he is a good guy. He would still carry my bags if I spent the night at his place. Often times pay for food if we ordered in or went out. Though sometimes I'd help pay or pay for things as well when I was able to. 

He seemed concerned about how I felt, my overall well being when I was with him. And even would try to get to know more about me or ask me about my day. We were always very open and honest with each other. It just felt something that was safe and natural to do. 

If I told him something painful that happened in my past he seemed very understanding and I was the exact same way with him. If he ever did something that made me sad he would hold me and even a couple of times cry. Telling me that the last thing he wanted to do was hurt me or lose me. 

He would constantly give me compliments and tell me things like he liked the sound of my voice or my eyes, my hair. The flow of our conversation. Etc. I always thought especially in the start of a relationship you are suppose to let the man take the lead when it came down to pursuing you. 

I often times would wait and let him text first or make the plans even if it was just us hanging out at his place. There were a few times he told me he didn't think that I was really into him. I said that wasn't the case and that I liked him a lot. And was attracted to him. 

All things that were completely true. From what he said I took that as he felt I didn't show him enough interest as he wanted, and that he might have been feeling a bit insecure. Both of which he told me were true. 

So afterwards I tried making him feel wanted. Nothing excessive. But say for example if he didn't text me all day, instead of giving him the lead to do that. At times I would text first. Or I would try to be more affectionate. Things like rubbing his neck or arm. Cuddling with him when we were on the couch or kissing his neck. 

All things he really seemed to enjoy. He was always a man of his word and never canceled plans with me. Last Thursday he asked if I wanted to hang out on and spend the night with him on Friday. I said yes. A couple of days before that one of his Dad's cars that he had been borrowing had been towed. He accidentally parked it on the street at a time he wasn't suppose to. 

In addition to hanging out and spending the night on Friday, originally I was going to drive over on Thursday to take him to the police impound near him to get the car. He does also have his own car might I add, but the tags are currently expired so I tend to do most of the driving whenever we go some place. 

On Thursday we made plans for me to come over around 3:30 or so. He usually has trouble sleeping at night and often times will rest throughout the day when he can. I live around 15-20 minutes away from him. So that day I got ready to go, ordered a coffee online and was going to head on out , pick it up then go get him to get his Dad's impounded car. 

A few minutes before I was ready to leave my place maybe about a little after 3 he texts me, saying he was still pretty tired and let's make it 4:45. It isn't abnormal for us to push things to a later time, especially with him typically being tired. And I admit I tend to arrive a bit later then I say I will most of the time. Usually by 10-15 minutes or so. 

After he text me I texted back that I did have things to do that day and what if we made it 3:45 ish instead of 4:45. I also didn't want to deal with rush hour traffic afterwards on my drive back home. After his text to change the agreed upon time when I asked about 3:45 instead I here nothing back from him. 

I tried texting and even calling him to confirm if 3:45 or so instead of 4:45 would work for him. But he never replied. I texted him I was on my way to pick up my coffee that I ordered. Maybe a block or two away from my apartment, and that if I didn't hear back from him within ten minutes or so after getting my drink, we would have to arrange another time to get his Dad's car. 

Got my coffee, tried texting and calling him and still no answer. I assume from as well as I know him now he had just gone back to sleep after texting me and didn't hear my texts or calls. Not unlike him to not hear the phone. Once recently, we were suppose to meet his parents for dinner. I got to his place in enough time to pick him up and drive to the restaurant. 

When I arrived and tried texting and calling to let him know I was waiting downstairs he didn't respond. He lives in an apartment building that in order to get inside of the building you need a key. Which I don't have. Luckily after trying to reach him for a few minutes someone was leaving the building and let me inside. 

I went up to his apartment and knocked on the door. No answer. Banged on it and could hear his TV going. Finally I heard him getting up and he opened the door. He had set an alarm on his phone so he could take a nap for about an hour and it didn't go off. 

We had to call and arrange to meet his parents 30 minutes later then we had originally planned. Luckily they hadn't left there house yet so it wasn't a problem. 

So my point is that he does tend to do stuff like over sleeping. Back to what happened on Thursday. So after getting my coffee and driving back to my place I finally get a text from him around 4:20. He apologized and said he feel asleep. Earlier when I wasn't getting a response from him I texted, let's just make it another day. That Friday would probably work better anyways. 

My sister (who lives maybe a couple of miles from him) had talked with me about possible hanging out for a bit on Friday. So when he was asleep and missed my texts I said it would be better because I would be in the area and that we were going to spend the night together and in between getting the car and hanging out later on, I maybe would see my sister for a bit. 

He said that was fine and no worries, that would work. Besides he had been really tired lately more then usual. So on Friday I leave my place a bit after 3ish. Get to his place to pick him up so he could get his Dad's car from the impound lot. 

We go there and I wait with him. He was hoping not to upset his Dad and try to take care of it without him finding out, but was unable to. So while we were there he called his Dad and told him what happened with the car. His Dad had to come by because they would only release it to the person who owned the car. 

His Dad shows up, we all wait a bit and then after his Dad shows proof of ownership his Dad leaves to drive home. My BF and I wait there for a bit longer. Over all it was close to two hours that we were there. I had tried to rub his leg a little on the way over and he told me not to. I assume he just wasn't in the mood and was a bit upset about the whole ordeal. 

While we were there he was texting on his phone a lot. He has joked once before when I was on my phone. Saying what are you texting your other guy. And I wasn't and mentioned that at the time. I asked him who he was texting so much and he said his brother. 

When he finally got his Dad's car he suggested that I follow him over to his parents place since I still hadn't heard back from my sister about hanging out. We both drove separately to his parents place. 

He parked his Dad's car there, and we went inside for a little bit. He got some laundry (his Mom washes his clothes for him because he doesn't have a washer or dryer.) said goodbye to his family. They thanked me for helping take him to get the car and my bf and I left in my car. 

I figured that we would probably just head back to his place. He had to take an online test for a class that night. He has taken it a few times before and I usually just let him focus on that and keep myself busy by reading and or doing something on my phone. 

Before getting back to his place he mentioned how his laptop had stopped working and asked if I minded if we stopped at a nearby store so he could run in and get another before driving back to his place. I said that was fine and wanted to stop by the mall to run in and get something which he was alright with me doing. 

I figured since I was in the area why not take care of that anyways. So we go to the mall. He waits in the car and I run inside and get what I wanted and come back about ten minutes or so later. From the mall I drive him to the store to get his laptop. 

After that he asked if I minded stoping at a sandwich shop on the way back which we did. We both got something to eat and headed for his place. Once we were getting off the freeway he asks what I had planned for the night. I told him I thought we were going to spend the night together. And he said, he wasn't feeling too good plus he needed to focus on taking his test. 

I asked him why he didn't mention changing his mind about me coming over earlier that day. To me it almost seemed like he just made me think that we would hang out so I would drive him around. Or changed his mind for whatever reason and was worried that I wouldn't if he canceled on me. 

I asked him why he hadn't told me and that he gave me the impression that was what we were going to do and that I had even packed my over night bag. He said well, I have been really tired lately. I mean I would have you come over but I want to be able to focus on my test. I mean if you could still go over to your sister's while I took it you could come over after. 

It was close to 8 at night. My sister and brother in law have a 7 year old child and 8PM is normally her bed time. My niece tends to want to spend time with me whenever I'm there and they have trouble getting her to bed if I'm there past her bed time. 

I explained that to him. And he said he was sorry he just needed to take the test. That the next day on Saturday we could go over to his parents house and have dinner there, together with them, his brother, there kid and his brothers fiancé. As he was getting out of my car he said don't be mad. Gave me a hug, got out and went inside. 

I drove back to my place. I felt very disappointed, disrespected maybe even a little bit used. But tried to give him the benefit of the doubt. Maybe he really wasn't feeling good, was upset about having to go through the whole car getting towed and ending up having his Dad find out. So maybe he just needed some time alone. 

Once before when I was spending the night with him and he had been drinking as usual I came back from smoking a cigarette downstairs to find him on his laptop on OK cupid. I asked him about it then and told him I was upset. He said well I hate that you smoke and it was a joke. I told him it wasn't funny and he said he was sorry and wouldn't do it again. 

I had gone online to see his OK cupid profile a few days or so later. I was browsing (didn't create my own profile or anything) and was shocked and hurt that he had logged on recently days after telling me it was a joke and he wouldn't do it anymore. 

I never asked him again about it. We would hang out and talk a great deal, go out, spend time with his family, and things like that. I assumed with all that everything was fine. But in the back of my mind I had doubts. I checked periodically and noticed he would log on to OK cupid quite a bit. 

I couldn't understand completely what was going on. It wasn't as though we were just casually dating, we were together. I assumed if he wanted to see truly see other people he would just tell me that. Being on the dating site and the fact that many times he would be texting on his phone a great deal made me wonder if he wasn't talking or trying to date other people. 

What confuses me about the whole time is up until recently he has acted as though everything was alright between us. We have disagreed a few times before, but always ended up working it out. He had mentioned he didn't like me smoking cigs and I have been and even told him I was working on cutting back with the intention of quitting. Which he seemed happy to hear. 

Friday night after I got home he told me his new laptop wasn't working and that he wouldn't be able to take the test by the time it was due that night. I asked if he could mention his problem to his professor and see about retaking it or if she would allow him to do extra credit or something. 

He said he was pretty sure she would let him retake it. So the next day on Saturday I go about my business. He doesn't text me at all the entire day. Around 7 or so that night I finally text him. And ask him what he was up to. He said he was at his parents. Didn't bring up anything about having me come over that night to have dinner with him and his family or anything. 

I asked him how he was doing. Figuring maybe he was still tired or sick as he said he was for a few days. Or thought he may have still been not feeling good after dealing with his Dad's car getting towed. 

He text back his was alright. Never asked how I was or what I was doing or anything like he normally does. I asked if he ever got his laptop working and he replied with no and that he was going to return it on Sunday. Any question I asked he responded with a brief almost close ended answer. 

I figured maybe he was still feeling upset about everything and didn't text back that night. I thought about how he did what he did on Sunday, how he seemed more distant lately when we were together, blew me off on Saturday, canceled plans at the last minute on Friday. Plus the fact he was texting less, seemed not to want to even text me on Saturday and seemed more interested in texting on his phone on Friday then even really talking or being around me when I was there. 

So I got on and checked his OK cupid profile Saturday. He had logged on shortly before I texted him Saturday night. I assume if in fact his new laptop wasn't working he maybe either stopped at his computer lab at his University (he sometimes has a morning class there on Saturday) or maybe he logged on his Mom's computer as he sometimes does when he is at his Parent's. (His Iphone was damaged maybe 2-3 months ago and he still has a flip phone. So no way to get online from that) 

I checked periodically Saturday night and again a couple times today (Sunday) The last I checked it said he hadn't logged back on. Now it is almost 8 at night here and he hasn't tried contacting me at all. Which before the last couple days is unusual for him. Normally he texts or sometimes even calls me either in the day time or at least in the evening. One day I hadn't heard from him at all but he contacted me the very next day. 

Now I am completely lost on what is going on. I don't know if he is losing interest in me, looking for or found someone else. And instead of telling me he is just slowly ghosting me. (Before him I dated someone who did that after just 3-4 months of dating) Or is it he just has been having a rough time lately and wants to be alone. I hope and figure if he has lost interest and has moved on he would tell me and not just disappear. He still has a couple of towels of mine, body wash and some other similar hygienic products of mine that I have been keeping at his place. 


Nothing of great value, but I'd imagine if things were over between us he would at least have me come get my things. Then again maybe if they are he won't there is no telling. And that isn't currently my main concern. I'm worried that he doesn't want to be with me and or found someone else. 

Yesterday (Saturday) I was feeling very sad. I tried to do household chores a bit, worked out in my apartment a little and even did a bit of online work. (I work from home) I watched TV, relaxed. And did my best to try and not let it bother me. But it was difficult to do as much as I would have liked. Instead I tended to just sit there a bit lost in my feelings of being upset, uncertain and worried. 

Before bed I took a shower, and cried a little. I thought about how sometimes I let fear and worry of what might happen or even dwell on negative things from my past get in my way more then I should. That it is alright to acknowledge my emotions. But not control me or my life as much. And not even just with my BF but with anything. 

I realized that in addition to that sometimes I am a bit anxious about the future. Just anything in general. That I might think of goals I might have, like getting in shape for example or others things and instead of trying to figure out a plan and taking action. I will sometimes delay working on it and figure out how long it could take to reach the goal if I worked on 30 minutes most day, then an hour, two hours etc. 

And while it is one thing to figure out steps I can take to make it happen I should focus more on working on the steps instead of dragging my feet. That If I figured out what it would take to make something happen I would just get started. And if I ended up reaching the goal faster then great. If not at least I'd be working on it instead of wasting time. 

So today (Sunday) I woke up and tried focusing on some of my goals to improve my life. Like decluttering my place and even working out a little. It took my mind off of being upset with my BF and I was able to get a lot done. 

Now I am still lost and deeply concerned on what is going on in my relationship. I feel so upset and alone. Part of me just wants to cry and then get ready for bed. But I don't know what to do. I have read before that it is normal for guys to pull back a little and it is best to give them space. 

But I don't know if that is the best way of dealing with it or if that is even what is happening. I feel lost, confused, and so overwhelmed with it all. 

What do you think is happening with him? Why might he be getting on an online dating site? Could he just need space, is just patiently waiting and giving him that the best way to go about it? What could I do now, and how can I feel better?

5adwl3,2,2016-10-31,What do you do when you can't attain the only thing that you believe will treat your depression?,Kogoshi,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5adwl3/what_do_you_do_when_you_cant_attain_the_only/,"Bit of backstory, I've had anxiety and depression for at least 10 years, I've suffered from varying degrees of panic disorder, generalised anxiety, social anxiety, agoraphobia and depression - in terms of severity, at it's worst I couldn't leave my house, I even had panic attacks when I went for a shit, or a shower.   

Life was very difficult then, but I had hope for the future, I was in University, and the idea of getting over my anxiety and getting a good job and living a normal life &amp; getting to do all the things I want to do kept me going through suicidal times.  

Fast forward a few years, I managed to complete my degree against all odds, and my agoraphobia and panic attacks are under control - I'll never be cured, I still battle every day - trying so hard to appear normal, but I'm much better at handling it, and that's a great feeling.  

My depression is still pretty bad, mainly because I can't find work. I recently turned 30, I have a degree in a tough portfolio-based industry - and I'm clearly not good enough for a job yet.  

I try applying for internships, voluntary work, all over the country - nothing is happening for me.  

So in the meantime I'm trying to get something casual that won't be too soul destroying to keep the bills paid, part-time would be ideal so I could keep chipping away at my portfolio work.   

The problem is, I literally can't get shit - employers are turning me away because I assume they see my degree and think I'm just gonna leave as soon as I get offered a 3D job - I got rejected from a job at a pet store the other day, my mum has bred cats &amp; dogs her whole life, I'm a huge animal lover - but apparently I'm not good enough for a fucking part time job in a pet store.   

My life has other complications but this is the one holding me back the most at the minute, I'm so fucking depressed about how much of a fucking failiure I am, and everyone sees me as - despite how hard it's been I'm still trying, it's been years and I'm getting absolutely nothing.  

I'm worried all my hard work is for nothing, I'm 30 and I spend my youth being severely mentally ill, now I'm old as fuck, and still can't enjoy my shred of youth that grows further away every day, because I must literally be unemployable.  

I'm not superstitious but my only logical explanation is I'm cursed, everyone I talk to about this has literally no idea, even my job coach is gob-smacked every time I see her and tell her I've heard nothing back from anyone I apply to.  

I need some insight, I can't stop watching videos of people hanging themselves or being run over, I know how quickly things can spiral out of control and I'm getting worried I won't be able to take this much longer - I genuinely believe I'm a good person and I've been shit on by a lot of close people to me, I can't work out why it's happening to me.  

Please don't suggest going to talk to a professional, I know it's the go-to solution but it won't help, I've seen so many and they never know what to do with me :/  

Thanks for reading.  "
5aewxb,5,2016-10-31,Career Guidance - Currently in a Business Intelligence and Analytics program,DataIsOmniscient,bigdata,https://www.reddit.com/r/bigdata/comments/5aewxb/career_guidance_currently_in_a_business/,"Hi, all,

I'm a US citizen currently finishing my first semester in a Business Intelligence and Analytics program near NYC.  I'm trying to position myself in the most opportunistic way for a successful career in big data.

**Background**

* Undergrad: Finance (very few mathematical/statistical/programming courses)
* Work Experience:
 * Internship in Compliance (summer)
 * Shipping logistics for small online store (2 years)
 * Administrative Assistant -&gt; Database Manager -&gt; Business Intelligence in a small nonprofit. (SQL Queries, but no actual analysis). (4 years)

**Current Courses:**

* Multivariate Analysis
* Optimization and Process Management
* Data and Knowledge Management
* Data Warehousing
* By end of semester will have certifications in R, Python, SQL, SAS (unofficial), and had a boot camp in Hadoop

**Career Questions**

* ***Points of entry***: What sort of industry/job would I most likely be able to transition into given my background and my current education in business intelligence and analytics?  (Caveat: I'm not interested in going into Financial industry unless there really aren't other options).  Here are my current interests - I'm curious how many of these are feasible, and if none of them are, where I can potentially break into.
    * *Technology*: Internet of Things, Self Driving Cars, Artificial Intelligence, Automation, Sensor Data, Image/Video/Audio recognition
 *  *Consulting (Operations)*: Optimization, Networking, Cost reduction, Human Capital Allocation, Waste Reduction, Inefficiency Identification
 * *Social Media/Entertainment*: Sentiment Analysis, Web Scraping, 
 * *Misc*: Data Visualization, Athletics, Innovations, Psychology/Behavior

*  ***Salary***: Dependent on the above question, what type of salary can I expect?  Specifically in the NYC area - I've seen very disparate data, and often it doesn't elaborate on what background they're from AND what part of the country AND what industry AND what skills the person has.  I understand that I will be entry level and that I won't get a data science due to my lack of intensive mathematical/programming skills, but I'm curious what range I should be aiming for.
* ***Internship or Full Time***: I'm about to start job searching.  Do companies hire grad students right out of their first semester in the understanding that they are a work in progress and have potential?

Ideally, I will end up a financial actuary, or at least that is my goal. I am curious if a semester of graduate-level econometrics would pad my resume in any meaningful way. My major requires at least one master's level econometrics course, and I am not sure if I should take it to another level beyond that.

I hope to complete exams P, FM, and C before graduation, and will complete an internship if I can find one. Apart from that, I do not know what else I can do to make myself more competitive. I am open to any suggestions you all might have. Since I have some time before I graduate, so I am trying to use it every way I can to be more competitive.

EDIT: I forgot to mention that I know MATLAB and will be learning R and Python over the next six months. Currently seeking part-time programming work on campus."
5afihv,7,2016-10-31,Internship! Any advice?,chefvibzy,Chefit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chefit/comments/5afihv/internship_any_advice/,"I'm nearing the end of my 2 years of culinary school, and heading out for my internship in January. I've been through a couple of great places now, and I'm a shitload more confident now than I was, say, a year ago. However, there are still loads of things I know I need to improve on, so I had a few questions for you fine folks.

The place I'm going to for my internship is a very high volume, upscale french restaurant, opened by a big name in the industry. I've worked at one high volume place before, and I struggled... a lot. When it gets to a certain amount of orders, shit just hits the fan, and I have a fucking terrible time keeping track of what I have going, what needs to go out, what I'm waiting for a fire on. I somehow manage to pull myself through it by the end of service, but I always end up asking myself after every shift, ""am I fucking even cut out for this job?"" so far, I've still stuck around because I still love the work.

Any advice for how I can improve when it comes to that? Am I just shit at high volume line cooking?

Besides that, any other advice for a young cook going into his internship? I plan on having my notepad, following every order from the chefs, and honing my knife skills."
