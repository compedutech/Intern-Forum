93jylq,3,2018-07-31,[For Hire] IT - SCCM &amp; Jamf experience. Looking to relocate!,erik29gamer,SeaJobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeaJobs/comments/93jylq/for_hire_it_sccm_jamf_experience_looking_to/,"Looking for an IT job! Currently living in Wisconsin and looking for a change.

I graduated last year with a degree in Information Technology Management, and minors in Business Administration and Project Management.

Currently working doing SCCM and lab/software management. This includes scripting software installs, making and deploying windows images, and anything hardware-related in computer labs at the university I work for.

Prior to this, I completed an internship at Jamf Software, so I have decent knowledge of Mac OS/ iOS management as well.

PM me for a resume or any questions!"
93k0w3,9,2018-07-31,(Hopefully) I got my worst gig out of the way,thenextbigming,mobileDJ,https://www.reddit.com/r/mobileDJ/comments/93k0w3/hopefully_i_got_my_worst_gig_out_of_the_way/,"I've heard horror stories here and there about how gigs have fallen apart or gone wrong and figured it was only a matter of time before I came across the worst gig I will ever play. This past weekend finally fit that description and I'm definitely hoping that any gig I work in the future will be better than what happened.  

**Background**

Some background, I'm a college student living at home for the summer. I intern for a line of work that doesn't have much to do with mobile djing, so basically I only dj events every once in a while when I can make the time for it. Because of this, I'm not part of a big company or anything, I just work for a guy who has a lot of contacts and can land me gigs every other week if I need them, ranging from birthday parties to school events. Also this guy is pretty bad at communication. He'll go days and even weeks without texting back just to call me out of the blue about a gig the next day.  

**Before the gig**

At the previous gig with him a few weeks ago, he had mentioned to me about working an 80's night event on the 28th. I told him I would be clueless at that kind of event as I'm a college student used to djing college bars. I can do top 40 for summer events but thats it. He told me it was fine, he would provide a hard drive with music and tell me what to play next. I'm better at mixing than he is anyway and when we work events together, he's just on the mic or organizing everything.  

Fast forward to the 27th, I got a fever and I haven't heard anything about this gig on the 28th. I text him asking what time he wants to set up tomorrow but don't get a response all day. I assume that he doesn't need me for the event so I go back to trying to die peacefully.  

**Day of the gig**

The 28th comes around, still no response, fever has gone down slightly. Then the call arrives. He calls me at 7:30 p.m. asking how soon I can pack my gear and get to a pool about 15 minutes away. Yep, it's the 80s night event. I was planning on brushing up on my 80s music before the event but because he never replied when I asked him about it, I never bothered to do that.  

I load the car in record time, and get to the pool at 8:05. It's already a mess, parents are either drunk or trying to figure out where the musics at. My boss had asked me over the phone to have music playing by 8. Turns out there was supposed to be music playing at the event by 7.  

I get two lifeguards to help me unload and set up as much as they would know how to. Now the bigger problem. I have very little 80s music besides drunk bar songs white college girls sing at the top of their lungs half an hour before close. And my boss, who was supposed to have a hard drive is nowhere to be found at this event that started an hour ago.  

I try to play some upbeat pop music as an opening while I wait for my boss to show up. 30 seconds into Treasure by Bruno Mars and I have about 6 drunk moms yelling how its not 80s music. It doesn't help that in my rush I left my mic at home.  

Finally my boss shows up, a little buzzed but with a hard drive. I load it up and he starts telling what to play. Except none of the music has the bpm listed in Serato. We borrow a mic from the pool, fade out the music, and my boss goes on the mic to tell people thanks for coming out yada yada yada while I unplug my SZ and Serato tries to analyze 200 of the greatest hits from that decade.  

Longest two minutes of my life but the gig was a breeze from there on out. The next 20 minutes though was spent between trying to figure out what to play next and trying to set up lighting for the dance floor at the same time. I mixed together the music pretty well imo, and got most people dancing. The event went to 11 and the last hour I genuinely had fun. At one point I slowly brought in the guitar intro from Sweet Child Of Mine over some song from a band called Depeche Mode (?) and the event organizer who was wearing a Guns N' Roses tour shirt lost it. I ended up playing all the way until 11:15 to compensate for being late even though it wasn't my fault. Thankfully it was all smiles as we ended on It's Tricky.  

Annoyingly enough, my boss dipped out after we set up the lighting and he wasn't there to help tear down either so I was stuck tearing down on my own for about half an hour.  

Sorry for the long text post but I just wanted to recount the worst gig I've had so far and hopefully ever.  

**TLDR** - got called to work a gig half an hour after it the event started, its an 80s theme party, I'm a college student. I also had a fever."

93kps8,1,2018-07-31,I have decided to become an accounting major. But I have a few questions.,DolphinPuckRL,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/93kps8/i_have_decided_to_become_an_accounting_major_but/,"Hey guys I have decided to major is accounting as I find it interesting and think I would enjoy working as an accountant. 

Here are a few main questions. 

Is there anything that you would've wished you knew when you first got into accounting that you could share with me. 

Is it unlikely that I could find a job as a personal financial adviser that is the career that checks all my boxes as I really enjoy talking to people and helping them.  

If it is unlikely what is the entry level position that I should shoot for to build up enough experience to be considered for the position? 

Finally My aunt is a financial manager at a large textile company and she said that she could get me an internship there to give me some on the job experience. Do you think that this is something that I should actively Pursue or is there a reason that I shouldn't go for it.

I personally think it's a great opportunity but I'm curious as to what you guys think 


Thanks a ton, I am super excited to learn all that I possibly can!

93lfxg,18,2018-07-31,What's the magic ingredient?,kermit54,aspergers,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/93lfxg/whats_the_magic_ingredient/,"I'm honestly trying to figure what ingredient that me (and possibly all/most Aspies) are missing that makes us come off as awkward in conversation. I've been praised (and not fake praise) for my ability to give speeches, granted most of that was for the content and not the delivery but regardless my delivery must have been fine and I've always gotten pretty solid grades when it came to speeches in school.

Still, social interaction was always an issue. In middle school, I was put into this weekly social group with four other kids (all of whom were more severe than me) and was sent to a summer school four times a week also for social skills (again, most of the kids were lower functioning than me). I probably shouldn't really have been placed in either of those considering the kids that were in them, but regardless the fact that I was signaled out as needing help in social interaction is my main point. Also, neither of these clubs were just where they took the shy kids/kids who didn't have a lot of friends and put them in a ""fun"" group. I had those in Elementary school and loved them. The one in middle school (and the summer school) were only if you were diagnosed, we did some fun stuff but academics and learning how to be socially ""right"" definately played a big role in both of them.

So, I'm just confused what the magic ingredient I'm missing is. I got my hopes up after passing an interview for a door to door sales internship (not really an internship, more like a full-time job, being an intern basically just meant they weren't expecting you to stay long at the job, it wasn't through school either, anybody could apply for it).

I'm still not clear as to how selective that interview process was, I was told I was interviewed by the easier of the two interviewers if that means anything. That would make sense since the person who did my interview was just an assistant manager, the other interviewer was the manager/owner of the company/ I've had A LOT of trouble with being in interviews in the past due to being awkward so I was super happy to get this job. The internship is over now btw.

Anyway, one day my trainer said after having the door shut in my face that ""people just don't like you, you do a bad job creating personal relationships."" He was COMPLETELY serious btw. So that basically took away the joy of having passed the interview, as I was taught in college (and got confirmed through experience), an interviewee hires the person they like/connect with the most.

I'm really struggling pinpointing as to why I got the job so for the sake of this I'm just going to say I got it for unknown reasons. It could've been a million reasons, it wasn't that high-profile of a job so maybe they just hire everybody, maybe I did form a personal relationship with the interviewer (I hope that's it but my best guess is she just wasn't that tough, unfortunately she doesn't work there anymore else I would've asked her how many people she generally hired that she interviewed).

Regardless, the fact that I was told by my trainer that I struggled forming personal relationships with people concerns me. After he said that, I really tried focusing on that for the rest of the people I saw that day (and days future), I would then ask him how I did with the personal relationship piece after each house. It never turned out well, for some reason I feel like there was one house that he at least said I did ""better"" on it, but that was the best compliment I ever got in terms of forming personal relationships. The next day we went out together he said towards the end something along the lines of ""it's like you're back at day one"" in reference to my ability to form personal relationships. For the record, he actually did compliment me on other things and wasn't that tough (it was just the personal relationship piece that I never really got complimented on).

And to clarify, it isn't the end of the world if I'm not a good salesperson. Forming personal relationships is a piece of being a good salesperson (then there's the actual selling piece). Not even close to all people who are good at creating personal relationships are good at selling things (there's manipulation involved with it definately, as well as MANY other things). I don't want to say a blanket statement and say that all people who are bad at creating personal relationships are bad at being sales people although I do think there's probably a bit of truth to that.

Regardless, forming personal relationships is important for every job due to the interview. And honestly, quite important in life also just in general (this is debateable though). I just don't understand the magic ingredient I'm missing, I try to break down social interaction and check off stuff like eye contact, body language and whatnot. That's all good for me. I used to think that I just struggled to speak well in general. But as I said earlier, I'm good (or at the very least, acceptable) at giving presentations so I'm obviously capable of that. I just don't understand the magic ingredient I'm missing that makes forming personal relationsips so difficult and makes me come off as awkward. I'm really stumped on this one.

It's a shame because you can be bad at so many things in life and it not really matter that much. For example, I'm awful at art and anything music. But it's like being bad at social interaction is like death because it's required for every career field (to get past the interview at least).

I have other ways Aspergers is affecting me that doesn't revolve around social interaction but this is by and far the most important one. I'll tackle the others later, but I really just need to find out what the secret ingredient is that I'm missing. And I don't think the solution is practice anymore. I got the door to door sales job so I could practice that and it really didn't make me better at it.

Also, this is NOT for a lack of trying. I think my trainer even commented once saying, I can see you're trying, you're just not doing it well"" when it came to my social interaction.

BTW, my trainer actually was a really good guy btw. As I said earlier, he did compliment me on other things, it was just forming personal relationships I could never seem to get complimented for. Also, my best guess for the reason why he knew I was trying was because I did try asking people more ""personal"" questions vs. just the necessary questions (when he first started training me I neglected to do the former, not realizing it was important). The issue was that I came off as robotic when I asked just the required questions he told me. He didn't specifically tell me what the issue was when I asked the more personal questions but my guess is I came off as awkward (again, missing that magic ingredient). Either way, both are really bad, I'd almost rather come off as robotic than awkward. Then again, maybe I still just came off as robotic even when asking the more personal questions, all I know was that he wasn't impressed. 

Also, that brings me to another small thing I want to share. In that, during one interview in particular in which I was called awkward, I did ask personal questions. Such as the person said he was leaving to go somewhere after the interview when we first started so I asked him, ""oh cool, where are you going?"" Later, he started talking a little bit about travel so I asked him questions such as, ""where are you from?"" I ask these kinds of questions in lots of interviews I've gone to (and sadly been told, or sometimes not told directly, that I was awkward or some variation of awkward). I honestly was really proud of myself in some interviews in which I was later told I did not do a good job in because I actually did try to get to know the person who was interviewing me. I thought it was my tone of voice but now I'm just lost.

Sorry for the wall of text, just trying to figure everything out"

93lqmz,1,2018-08-01,For the first time in my life I feel stupid and scared,Depressed-Onions,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/93lqmz/for_the_first_time_in_my_life_i_feel_stupid_and/,"In a couple of days I move away to start an internship. This is the first time I will be away from home without someone close to me. I’m going to a new place, with a new language, and I don’t know a single person. I will truly be alone for the first time ever. On top of the anxiety and building depression, I’ve basically just been called useless by the owner of the company I will be interning for. I was given about 3 1/2 weeks notice for this internship, and during this time I was given about 50 hours of video to watch plus another 75ish developing an app. During this time I’ve maintained a full time job + overtime (I need the money to support myself  during this internship) so I haven’t been able to learn everything I wanted to learn. About a week ago I was given a test to turn in, I turned it in and that’s when the owner basically called me useless. I put in so many hours, so much effort, just to be called useless. The anxiety that’s building inside is starting to effect my physique, lost 10 lbs in 2 days while keeping the same routine as normal. I can feel all my negative emotions coming out telling me to cancel the internship. Everybody around me is very supportive of me, and most have high expectations, but so far I’ve only let people down, and I haven’t started this journey yet. 

Any thoughts or opinions on what I should do is appreciated. I’m just very confused with my thoughts, and my doubts about this are starting to overwhelm my head. Maybe I should stay close to home, I know I can be successful here, but this opportunity could change my life completely."
93lrj0,1,2018-08-01,Help type me!,disorganizedisaster,MbtiTypeMe,https://www.reddit.com/r/MbtiTypeMe/comments/93lrj0/help_type_me/,"So, I think I have an idea of what my type is, but I want to get some feedback. I keep changing my mind about what my type is as I analyze my behaviors more. So I'd really like to get some outside perspectives.

\- How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.

22 Female. I'm a college student majoring in computer engineering. It's okay. I'm not excited about it, but I can handle it. I've already changed my major once, so I kinda have to stick it out. Now that I'm here and experiencing life, I'm wondering if I should've majored in something like Marketing. I'm interested in people and I'm creative. I think it would've allowed me to interact with people more. Computer engineering is kinda lonely and drives me a little nuts unless I'm designing the UI. I love communicating with people \[that I'm comfortable with\] and I like drawing ideas from them, but I'm intensely independent.

\- Is there a medical diagnosis that impact your mental/comportamental stability somehow?

I have a bit of anxiety. Currently on medication for it right now, which helps a bit. Haven't noticed any changes in my personality, though anxiety has decreased a bit.

\- Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?

My parents were very strictly religious, structured folks. My dad was a domineering type of guy, and we utterly clashed. I very much dislike being told what to do and just like to do things my own way, but my overbearing dad always wanted to dole out instructions. Didn't understand my energy, spontaneity, and sensitivity. I stuck with religion until I was about 17. The stress of all the rules just boiled over, and one day I decided I was done. I've been agnostic since, though I've made a few basic spiritual theories/beliefs. I moved out a couple years ago. The freedom of living outside of my parents' house and being able to choose for myself is something that one cannot put a price on. Although I clashed with my parents a lot, I'm not mad at them or anything. Me and my dad tolerate each other now, and I get along with my mom very well.

\- If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?

I definitely enjoy some alone time, although an entire weekend to myself in most cases is too much (unless I'm doing something that particularly draws my attention). I hate the isolated feeling of being alone too long. Ideally, I'd hang out with some people for 33% - 50% of the day, and then have the rest of the day to my own devices. 100% ambiverted. I have definitely noticed that I do better when I'm around people frequently, though. When I have a roommate and get to talk to them all the time, my energy levels  and happiness are generally higher. I get a lot of energy from talking to people that I'm comfortable with, less with strangers. I dislike small talk, and I'm not good at it, so talking with strangers kind of stresses me out. I can play the small talk game if I try, but it's certainly not natural.

\- Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?

Sometimes, yes, sometimes, no. It really depends on my mood, the type of project, and whether or not I'm excited about it. If I'm excited /passionate about something, I fill the leadership role a lot better. I can give energy to the team, but I also dole out tasks better. If I'm excited, I can get very focused and notice areas of improvement easily. I organize better. Even so, I'm still a generally disorganized person, and I do better if I have an organized person on the team who can deal with the mess in my head. If I'm not excited about it, expect a loose leader with no sense of organization. I like the idea of leading, I just don't really think I'd be particularly good at it without a right hand man. Also, sometimes I can get controlling with parts of the projects - things that I have a specific idea for. If a part of a project is important to me, I usually don't let others touch it. I'll check in to see what they think and adjust it, but won't let them put their hands on it if it can be helped.

\- Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?

Absolutely not. When I was taking lab based courses, I always did really well on theoretical problems, but I hated going into the lab and using my hands. I'm uncoordinated and don't follow directions well. I'm not good at figuring out physical problems. In lab, my group is always the last to finish - I'd assume this is because of me and my lack of skill with practical problems.

Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.

Yes and no. I could never just sit down and draw shit. I have a very good sense of colors though. I've found out excellent ways to blend colored pencils together to make pictures that look like they've been printed. I love vivid colors. And I'm also very good at designing themes. I'm currently on a computer science internship right now, and the first thing I noticed about our software was how old and ""ugly"" the design was. I'm currently 1/3 through redesigning the software, and the marketing team is thrilled with how it looks. I usually get inspiration by looking at something else. I'll see someone else's website and say ""hmm.. what if we did x with  the tabs"". Then I'll look at another website and say ""and what if we did y with the background"". I'm very good at taking inspiration from multiple different sources and creatively re-implementing it.

What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?

I have an odd relationship with the past. I know that factually, my past has been pretty shit, yet somehow when I look back on it, none of it seems so bad. My mind downplays the negative aspects and remembers most things in a positive or neutral light. I have almost a detached remembrance of the past, and often, I ask myself, ""did that actually happen?"" I can get nostalgic. I like to rewatch old movies and listen to old songs. I have some items from my childhood days, but I've found that I'm not very attached to them. I get very attached to new items, and usually, the longer I have them, the less I attached I become (am I ever going to get married?). The present - I guess I live in the present. sort of? The thing is that my mind is usually off wandering through it's own corridors. Exploring ideas. Thinking about some theory. Analyzing my work on some project. Thinking of ideas to improve a project. Analyzing myself. Reading about new ideas. It's not really placed in the past, present, or future. It's in a timeless realm, exploring ideas. I used to think about the future more when I was younger, but not as much anymore. I don't really know where I want to go with my life, and I don't think I'll know until I've experienced more. So currently, the future isn't on my mind much. I have other things - ideas - that I'd like to explore instead. Here's my bit on the future though. I want to do things that are going to make a lasting impact. Everything I do, it's with the hope that it'll impact people or myself for years to come. When I take a class,  I don't bs it because I think it's useless information. I think, ""this information could be useful to me at point in my career. I need to make sure I learn it"". Or if I were ever to go to a 3rd world country and help them out, I wouldn't hand out food. I'd teach them how to farm. I'd teach them how to build. And then they can teach their children the same things, and one day, they won't be a third world country anymore. Whenever I do something, it's always with the hope of longevity. I greatly dislike doing relatively miniscule things.

\- How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?

I feel emotions pretty intensely, although sometimes I can't figure out where they're coming from and I need to ""retrace my steps"" to figure them out. I can get offended easily, especially when someone displays even the slightest amount of a condescending attitude. It's like I have this nice little happy flame burning in me, and then someone pours some gasoline on it and all of the sudden it's out of control. Usually, I try to keep my emotions to myself (it's probably best that I do this until I've calmed down). These emotions are fleeting and fast though. They die down within an hour or so, and then I barely remember their existence. I'm pretty much incapable of holding grudges. I think the longest I've lasted is about 3 days, and by the end of those three days, I was physically struggling to keep the emotions alive. Anyways, aside from hurt/anger, I can get quite melancholic. I love sad stories. I love when stories make me feel melancholy. It's my favorite emotion. I also feel a lot of pride in the things that I make. Not necessarily physical things, but designing a webpage, or setting up my room pretty, or even writing a good comment or post. My work is dear to me. I'm pretty lazy, but when I put effort into something and it turns out well, I'm intensely proud of it.

\- Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why would you?

I don't set out with the goal of challenging authority...  but if they exert their authority over me, I'm probably going to rebel. I just hate being told what to do. There are 3 scenarios where I'll be happy 1.) I'm left to my own devices 2.) I'm in charge 3.) My ideas are being accepted and considering by the team. I need to be a primary contributor, and I need to be well respected. I do enjoy teams for the purpose of brainstorming and refining my ideas. But at the end of the day, I need the freedom to do my part as I wish. That being said, I currently have a part-time job where my boss is very loose with rules and a kind person. I respect what he wants, and I sincerely respect him for being a great person. I take the basic assumption that everyone deserves respect, it's just that if you cross my line, I'm likely to challenge you on it pretty promptly.

\- What do you hate? Why?

I hate repetitive tasks. With a burning passion. I have to exert all of my available energy to keep my mind focused on them. They're not entertaining enough to naturally keep my mind occupied, but they take up too much concentration for my mind to think about other things. I frequently make mistakes on repetitive tasks because I can't focus on them. My mind easily wanders and I find that I've stopped doing the task when I zone back in.

Well, thanks for reading through. Please feel free to ask more clarification questions. I can't help but think I haven't covered everything!

Edit: So this post came off a little bit more ""firey"" than I actually am. I'm a tad worked up right now because my project at work (which I was somewhat excited about) got postponed, and instead I'm supposed to work on some boring repetitive crap for the next few days. Also, this postponing issue is due to my boss' lack of communication with other people... so yeah, take the firey, ranty parts with a grain of salt. Still somewhat true, just not as much as they sound."
93lu3u,11,2018-08-01,Bridesmaid anxiety,browniesbite,HannahlyzeThis,https://www.reddit.com/r/HannahlyzeThis/comments/93lu3u/bridesmaid_anxiety/,"First of all, congrats to Hannah and Ella! 

Second, I just listened to their latest podcast on friendship jealousy and friends getting married. Thumbs up from me. Really awesome to hear Hart share her point of view. 

Finally, I am a bridesmaid in an upcoming wedding. I am soooo happy for my friend. She's been through some shitty guys and it's so great seeing her with this one and I wish them the best! You can tell the vibe good together. I can also foresee some future arguments, but I do think they can make it. For her, getting married at this age (late 20s) makes sense. **But I'm so ready to get this day over with**. Is that totally awful? I already spent so much money for the bachelorette trip and the bridesmaid dress, and I still have to get shoes and fix my hair (it's a bright color and I want it toned down but that means bleach and buying some more color that's a bit more wedding appropriate), and probably need to get my makeup professional done. I feel like the ugly duckling of the group; everyone is just really good at makeup and looks are a HUGE thing back home. Like, girls would wear heels and be all dressed up for the local college. I want to look good in those photos though! 

I'm also dreading it because a wedding= socialization. I've been so anti-social lately. My social battery is completely depleted this summer. I've been focusing on my career, my new puppy and working through a lot of issues with my boyfriend (we gave our relationship a round 2). Some of the girls are the kind of girls who can be bitchy but ""are only kidding"" and second hand compliments are everywhere. Thankfully, the bride isn't like this (or else we wouldn't be friends). 

Not going to lie, I've been in a relationship longer with my current boyfriend, even minus the year we were broken up and we are not engaged. Not even close. I was hesitant of him even coming because I didn't want him to think my friend's wedding (which is going to be extravagant) is what I want. Also, we have a tendency to become overly codependent on each other and I will be busy doing whatever I need to do in wedding party so he needs to be able to stand alone. (He has his own issues and one is thinking everyone is judging him). I know I'm going to be thinking the entire time if this will ever happen to me....to us. 

I do feel like my friend has always been a step ahead of me. We are the same age but when she graduated college, she went to work full-time and I went to grad school in another city. She eventually moved to another city as well to be with her boyfriend. He proposed to her in PARIS (oui oui picture perfect photos), moved to a house, and here we are. I barely graduated last year, finished my intern year, and am struggling a bit financially/emotionally/mentally/etc. I barely laid a good foundation and I know it's only up from here but I won't magically have my shit taken care of by the time the wedding comes. 

I am excited but also dreading this day. What if I trip walking down the isle? What if I fall asleep during the ceremony while standing up? What if I'm ugly? What if I sweat too much? Is this anxiety and what do I do to prepare? If I can't take care of myself, then how can I be there for my friend on one of the most important days of her life?

I got good grades. I sacrificed every summer I could to work and get internships. I still had a social life but I never seriously pursued relationships.

Everyone I know calls me a successful, handsome guy. Sometimes they refer to me as a ""catch"". I've gone on a few dates with girls in college and, while they never worked out, I would hear a few months later (or even a year later) through a mutual friend that they wish that it did work out. But by then, I've already moved on.

So now I'm trying to catch up on my lack of dating experience. I've been using dating apps and it's just been a bad experience when trying to pursue serious relationships. I feel disappointed and frustrated most of the time.

I always think about what my friends told me. They see the good in me, why don't other girls? I don't want to seem entitled to a relationship but I just don't understand what I'm doing wrong. I'm 24, about to be promoted early, and I'm close to making six figures but sometimes I wish I could trade it all to happily lie next to someone.

Anonymous account. Poster. Lurker. Brief history following in order of events.

1. Mother has multiple sceloris.

2. Father alcoholic. Me 2.

3. She was abused mentally and physically for 5 years by heroin addicted baby dad. Daughter 7 now.

4.Had HPV didn't tell her. She got it 1.5 years in.

5. 3.5 year relationship.

So long story short. The kids dad was always in and out of jail. Met at a party when I was 20 and she was 15, but nothing happened except she thought I was super cute and I puked on her. Fast forward 7 years we meet at school and it turns out her mom is my moms doctor! We hit it off and things aren't good because she acted out her abusive relationship on me. I decided to stick it out and met her daughter and she treats me like a dad and calls me dad.

Fast forward through years of pain and amazing sex. I'm entering my second to last semester of school for programming. With a 3.7 GPA and she taking care of my mom. The stress is a terrible burden on the relationship. Break up right before finals for 3 weeks and I find out she fucked her baby dad twice a month after it happened.she wants to work it out. Problem is I have an internship an hour away and live with my brother there.

We have had sex twice this past year. Only once after she fucked someone else. Now I go from wanting to work it out, and we have good cuddle talks, to me getting drunk and freaking out on her about my insecuritiesover all it. About how she dont want me sexually because of the 8 month drought.

Current situation. We hang out last night and  she starts joking around about sex and says she wants a threesome with another guy. I say only if we can do it with another girl and she gets mad. 

Than tonight talking bout sex and porn and she starts talking bout how she has a cuckold fetish and suggests we be swingers. At this point she kicked out of her house and brought her here she outside after I officially ended it and refuses to come in saying she will sleep in the car.

What I'm asking reddit is 2 questions. Is this even worth saving, because I raised her kid for almost 4 years and the sex WAS amazing.
And how do you move on from this with so much effort involved.

TLDR; fell in love with emotionally unstable person, raised her kid like my own. No sec for 8 months, suggests swinging and has a cuckold fetish.

Teddy Roland started at Sirius in 2004 as an intern. The experience landed him a role at the newly acquired Howard Stern Show. To the audience, Teddy ""Microphone"" was known for his role of engineer for the Wrap Up Show. However, Teddy is probably most known as Artie Lange's bumbling assistant and the focus of the infamous Artie meltdown. While he ended ties with Artie shortly after, he remained at Sirius for five more years.

The story starts in 2008 with a taco truck from Brooklyn. ""Endless Summer"" was a food truck was a staple of Bedford Avenue for five years, gathering somewhat of a cult following in its time on the streets. In 2013, the current owners were looking to relocate and leave the food truck business behind them. The truck sat in a garage before eventually making its way to eBay in May of 2013.

[The $45,000 listing](https://www.ebay.com/itm/MOBILE-FOOD-TRUCK-TACO-TRUCK-WITH-PERMIT-ENDLESS-SUMMER-BROOKLYN-NEW-YORK-/330911950831?hash=item4d0be3a7ef&amp;pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;nma=true&amp;si=R4P%252BupLD5vLbpbQBGg2TO6l5Vto%253D&amp;orig_cvip=true&amp;nordt=true&amp;rt=nc&amp;_trksid=p2047675.l2557) for a taco truck caught the eye of Teddy Roland. He purchased the truck along with its permits and left his job at SiriusXM. “It was a no-brainer that this needed to come back,” [Roland told Brooklyn Magazine](https://i.imgur.com/XTpEqag.jpg). “It was a challenge to resurrect this thing...The old truck was falling apart, **so we had to get a new one built**, pump a little adrenaline and bring this baby back to life."". The original truck now sits [in the back of the Rocka Rolla bar in Brooklyn](https://i.imgur.com/J72oHgn.jpg) where it's been hacked up and re-purposed as a stationary grill. Teddy took the new truck back to its old stomping grounds on Bedford Avenue.

However, Teddy hadn't anticipated rival food trucks taking over Endless Summer's turf in its absence. A change was needed and that came [in the form of a brick and mortar location](https://i.imgur.com/0nZweZa.jpg). “The whole market of taco trucks on Bedford is rather saturated,” Roland told DNAinfo. “We always wanted to get a brick-and-mortar, this is what we dreamed of — a place where we can play and mess around with our own ideas.” Roland ditched the tacos for a sandwich shop under the same name in November 2014. The food truck was abandoned months later. ""We parted ways with the truck to focus on the sandwich shop..."" Roland announced in a twitter post. 

Endless Summer would go on to serve sandwiches in Brooklyn for the next 3 years. ""Here's hoping for another three years."" owners posted on their Facebook page. Then a mere 16 days later, Roland made the following announcement. ""It’s been a fun three years folks, but it’s time to hang it up."" The shop closed its doors seemingly out of nowhere the very next day on December 12, 2017. The location is now home to a Taiwanese restaurant.

Bit of background: a month ago I started working at a vacation rental company, as a translation intern. They have us translating property texts into different languages, and obviously, the texts are really similar. 

Couple of days ago, I proposed working with CAT Tools, and they seemed interested in it. Actually, they told me to look into it and tell them what I found. 

The thing is that the texts are really short, so it would be a loss of time saving them into a document (we get them from our online tool) and then running that same document through the CAT tool. 

So, to the actual question: are there any memory based CAT tools which don't involve having to upload a document? That is, just pasting it from the clipboard.

Thanks a lot in advance!

With multiple restaurants, catering services, luxury resorts and hotels mushrooming across the country, becoming a Chef in India is probably a lucrative and interesting career option to explore. Chef as a career is fast emerging as a preferred career choice in India. Although cooking doesn’t require any strict training and learning but those who want to be the best chef in India could be well served by choosing a culinary degree in addition to an apprenticeship. A comprehensive programme exclusively designed for those who want to do more than simply cook is important to fulfil their lives to be the best chef in the country.

Diploma, certificate and degree courses are available across India specialising in cooking and catering. Students who have passed 10+2 board examination (any stream- Science/Commerce/Arts) are eligible to pursue this course, however interest and passion are probably the two basic criteria required to be successful in this field, which is growing enormously and providing ample employment opportunities. The right exposure and guidance is essential to understand the various nuances of cooking and the long hours of patience required behind preparing cuisines.

Practical cooking sessions, industry internship, and exposure to the best cooking faculties would surely make a difference in the career prospects, which Inspiria provides the students to make them ready for achieving their respective goals.
We no longer consider chefs as glorified khansamas, bawarchis and maharaj rather they command as much respect as a top executive in a Multinational Company or Firm. So, if you think you have what it takes to be a chef then pursue a course and learn the finer techniques of how to go about it. A chef is highly trained and professionally skilled in cooking. He/she has to be proficient in the art and maintenance of kitchen. He continuously researches, experiments and innovates with ingredients and creates exotic dishes.

The basic qualities to be possessed by an aspiring chef are

Confidence – the key to create new recipes
Passion for Food – it is impossible to create new dishes without having love for food
Intense sense of Smell and Taste – two most pivotal ingredients of preparing and presenting a dish
Intuition – The art of combining flavours to perfection is inborn but can also be acquired by a chef
Perfectionist – A chef must be a perfectionist only then can he create food that has the right elements
Innovator – There has to be an inherent desire to churn out new dishes using different ingredients

You’ve been with me for a long time. I should have gotten rid of you when you first reared your ugly head, but I didn’t. The folly of my youth. And that terrible day, you were there for me in a way no one else could be. But I gave you too much freedom and I got left behind. Broken, and stripped of everything. I trusted you and you took it all.

You tried to do right, at first, but life is hard. I watched you struggle through your detective exam and barely pass, but it was your relapse after that that is causing me to make myself known to you. I will take you out and crush you if I have to. I have learned a lot from you by watching your actions. Actions really do speak louder than words, and you have been a great teacher.

I know things you don’t and that is what is going to be your downfall. I can actually see it in your partner’s eyes. She suspects something, not as much as she should but at least she is starting to see through your cocky veneer to your true weak self. You give in to your impulses too easily.

I’m starting the process with your latest case. I see you are struggling with it already so my new plan is working. I’ve barely begun and you’re already cracking. Why did you have to be so cocky, thinking you could get away with it? Did you really think it would work out exactly as planned? Why couldn’t you just accept everything and be content with yourself and your flaws? But you couldn’t, you thought you could fix everything, including yourself. Being a detective doesn’t fix anything. 

I’ll let you fumble around for a little while see if you get the point or not. I’ll still be watching. Waiting for you to slip up and go back to your old cocky ways.

Detective Tanner walked the room. Blood spray decorated the walls and ceiling. The shag carpet floor, soaked with something, ran up one wall in some strange homage to interior design. In front of Tanner, his partner, Wellsley, bent to retrieve something from the carpet. Although she seemed petite, she was solid muscle and all fire. With his height, he stood a head taller than her, giving the impression that she was petite. To Tanner, everyone was little. He looked down at her, waiting for her to move out of the way so he could continue walking the room.

Once she move, he continued to scan the walls and ceiling. The nitrile gloves he wore caused his hands to begin sweating. He hated the feeling. They were too tight, pulled on the hair on his wrists, made his hands sweat, and caused them to smell even after he washed his hands. If he had his way, he wouldn’t be wearing them.

Finishing the walk through, Tanner left the small apartment to add his samples to the field kit. The smell in the hallway, not really much better than the apartment, reminded him of something. It was a mingling of salami with sweat and urine. He couldn’t place his finger on it but something about it seemed familiar.

Tanner had to wait, for longer than he wanted, for his partner to finish up. He couldn’t imagine what was taking so long. The body had already been removed and was waiting at the morgue for them to arrive. He tried to not tap his foot but found himself doing it. He still had his gloves on, just in case she called him back into the crime scene. She almost never did. If he missed something, she would just berate him later. He hated when she talked down to him from her pathetic height.

Finally free to remove his gloves, he watched her place her own samples into the kit, close it up and remove her gloves. He gave a sigh and ripped his off stuffing them into a small bag and shoving them into his pocket.

They left the apartment complex, a small building crammed between other small buildings. The cool, crisp air of fall, a pleasant change from the stuffiness of the building. Leaves crunched under his feet releasing a slightly musty smell that he could almost taste. Anything was better than the salami, sweat, and urine of the building. A police line had been set up, they waded their way through the line to their car leaving the scene behind.

Tanner strapped in. The car reeked of fake pine from the small tree hanging from the rearview mirror. He would never allow suck fakery in his own car. He was better than fake pine. But it was her assigned vehicle and she drove it how she wanted. He gritted his teeth. It wouldn’t be much longer before he would get his own car and his own partner.

“Another body, same M.O., similar blood spray patterns, different background on the victim. What did you observe?”

Tanner thought about everything he had seen in the apartment. He pictured the scene in his head, then pictured the last murder she was referencing. She was right, the blood spray was similar, and while confirmation from the coroner was needed for death, that appeared to be the same. But the victims had different backgrounds. What was the common thread.

“The victims are quite dissimilar on appearance, but maybe they visited the same shop, or online location. There has to be something that connects them. Nothing is random.”

“Fair point, but that isn’t what I was asking. What did you observe today?”

Tanner observed lots of things and had no idea what she wanted. She obviously wanted something specific, and unless he could figure it out, he might as well brace himself for another of her lectures. He went through everything he had seen again. The blood spatter, the wet carpet, likely soaked with urine. The carpeting and layout of the apartment. Something clicked.

“The furniture was moved.”

“Yes, so we need to figure out if that was before the murder, during, or after.”

Tanner didn’t care, the interior design of the apartment didn’t affect who the man died. What did it matter.

Wellsley left the car and went to talk to the photographer. Tanner watched her waving her arms around. He wondered if she would be able to talk if her arms had been tied down. His lip turned up just a little at the thought before he pushed it away.

She hopped back in and drove them to the coroner. They received little new information. Even the little the coroner could deduce about the man’s lifestyle didn’t help them with any common thread. Tanner felt like they were at a loss. That left his suggestions of physical or electronic locations. A general pain to pour over those small details. Phone records and browsing histories were notoriously hard to scan through. Even when the IT specialists did most of the work, Tanner hated looking over their reports. If they didn’t find anything, him looking again wasn’t going to find anything new.

He dropped off his samples to the lab, signing over the samples. He then took the phone that had been collected at the scene down to IT and signed over that for analysis. Who even kept their browsing history? He always browsed in in cognito mode on his phone and computer. Not that he had anything to hide.

I see you have gone back to your old ways, I thought I was making progress with you but I guess not. A little space didn’t work with the last one so now I am stepping things back up. You have me concerned that you can’t be fixed. Maybe you really are broken. If you go down, we both go down and I’m not sure I can handle that. I will have to keep working on you. The walls are up but I can break through sometimes.

I know you hear me on occasion, even if you don’t always heed my wisdom or advice. If you don’t start listening, bad things will happen. I am gaining strength, I will fight for what is important to me. I will especially fight for what was once mine. You can’t completely stop me.

A week later, with very little new information, Wellsley and Tanner handed in the last report. Tanner, having already filed the case as cold in his head, was excited to be up for a new case. It didn’t take long for them to be called in. Wellsley drove as usual. Tanner, while excited to be on a new case, felt that Wellsley was being cold towards him. He couldn’t place his finger on it, but she was acting differently.

A partners, they hadn’t worked together for long, not had he asked much if anything of her. He wanted to get through his intern period as quickly and as quietly as possible with a good record. They had only worked together for almost the last three months, and if all went well, Tanner hoped this would be the last case they would work. His three month period ended in two weeks and he could have his own car, and maybe even his own rookie. He would begin moving up in the world. He would show them how good he really was when he didn’t have someone holding him back.

Wellsley parked the vehicle poorly near the police line. Tanner cringed as he stepped out of the fake pine to the fresh smell of baking bread. Being early in the day, the bakery was still churning out loaves of fresh bread. Across from the bakery sat a large brick and steel factory converted into upscale condo units.

The main entrance lead to an open courtyard filled with steel girders, steel walkways, large glassed over roof and tons of plants. It was almost a forest within the courtyard. Tanner grumbled in his head as they climbed up the hard steel stairs and along the solid walkway. 

The condo unit contrasted sharply with the brick and steel of the outside structure. Inside, blackened wood flowed from wall to ceiling, the grain beautifully contrasting with the charred effect. Once white screens divided the large space into smaller spaces each with an unknown purpose as there was few items of furniture. Soft reed mats covered what might have been concrete flooring making for a soft cushioned surface.

Tanner took his cue form Wellsley and donned his nitrile gloves. Someone handed him little white booties for his shoes. A short wizen woman, long black hair streaming down her back, black eyes almost like onyx barely visible through her crinkled cheeks. Tanner wondered how she was and why she had been allowed into the crime scene. He would never have allowed some stranger into his crime scene. He bit his tongue. Things would be different once he was running his own show.

He followed Wellsley through the various screened off rooms, they walked the entire area. The body was still in place. A woman this time. Wellsley would be all gungho to solve this one. To prove that she was better than the killer. Tanner had seen her do it before, he wasn’t happy with her workhorse attitude at that point.

Scanning the room, tanner began taking mental notes and organizing them for later documenting. Blood soaked the reed mats, it decorated the once white screens and disappeared into the charred wood walls. The crime had been called in early that morning by an unknown person. Tanner would have to listen to the recording later. The forensic team was pouring over the recording listening for any details that might give a clue to the person or location.

Tanner swept his eyes through the crime scene. There was little to stop the blood except distance. He paced out the furthest spot of blood he could see. The killer had used an incredible amount of force on the victim if the blood could spray all the way over to the wall of windows. Tanner prided himself on his deadlift capacity and wondered what the killer could press.

The rest of the walk was uneventful. Wellsley collected a few samples. Tanner took possession of the victims phone, computer hard drive, and tablet. Nothing of interest. He felt he was done, but the slave driver would expect him to do more, so he wandered the room, looking at random things and pretending to notice little details. He knew there was nothing to find. There was something about this case that just told him they wouldn’t find anything.

Not only are you cocky but now you have your blinders on to what is going on in the real world. You aren’t seeing things for what they are. In fact, you’re missing things that are right in front of your eyes. This is good for me but will be the unmaking of you. I’m making forward progress while you are only getting cockier. You think you’re smart, but really you’re only a smart ass. Neither will save you at this point. I will protect what is mine.

Pretty sure I am ridiculous for not noticing some of this stuff earlier, but I never much paid attention to the timeline of things before.

In the end of one episode, Richard has surgery on his brain tumor, wakes up and sees Derek kiss Meredith.

Beginning of the next, Addison shows up. When Richard chastises Derek for kissing *an intern* I thought that was the major issue. Now, knowing Richard and Mer's history, I realize he was basically being a dad who wants to break up the relationship between his daughter and the skeevy boyfriend. *lightbulb goes on*

Also, I had never connected that ""heart in an elevator"" happened just two episodes after Alex's failed practical exam. I thought he froze just out of typical intern fear. Nope, he was still without mojo from the exam. *duh*

Of all the issues between Derek and Addison, how does the fact that he *purchased 40 acres of land* go unnoticed or cared about? Even if they have the money or use separate accounts, that is a MAJOR purchase!

I completely forgot that George grew his hair to look more like Derek. Now the weird haircut makes sense. I always thought he just needed a change after Mer. *shrug*

Ellis made the home she was in promise not to let people visit. How then did Derek and Richard get in without Meredith knowing?

I will update with more as I go. I can't be the only one who is this dense. Haha!"

I work a normal retail job at a grocery store, and even though they pay pretty well, we just got bought out and are now under new management. When I was hired a year ago, the company had different values and was ""unique"" in a sense. Our customer base has changed and we are often dealing with angry customers who have problems with the changes we have made because of the new management. We also had to shut down two of our in-store dining options due to not having enough employees, and about half of the customer service team has quit over the past couple months. 

I always believe co-workers make a difference in making a work place bearable or not-- I use to enjoy the people I worked with but now there are only 1 or 2 people left that I enjoy working with. I drive 45 minutes just to get there, and more and more often my bosses are forgetting to send me home (we have to wait for a replacement to come in for us before we leave).

I have a good work ethic and always show up on time but since we have lost half our team they are scheduling me as a full time employee without giving me the benefits and my anxiety has risen to a level that it hasn't been at in a long time. Sometimes just the thought of making it through the day makes me have a panic attack and I find myself crying after shifts because of how tired and anxious I am. 

My boyfriend of 6 years has an internship right now which pays  well enough for him to support us if I decide to quit. We would be cutting it pretty close every month, but it is do-able. It would only be until I find a new job and I have already had a few interviews within the past couple weeks already but that never means it will be easy to find a new job.

So do I take control of my mental health by quitting and allowing my boyfriend to support us while I look for a new job (and find ways to make money such as babysitting/outdoor work in the mean time?) or do I suck it up, be an adult, and figure out a way to make it work?"

She’s spending the next 9 months working at an internship for a hospital. We ended things this morning, not forever, but just for now. You see we both decided on Atlanta because we fell in love with the city, however I was stupid and didn’t plan and unfortunately being 20 years old and no one to support me, I am struggling to pay bills as it is and I was unable to go with her. We’re still best friends, we still love each other. But the thought of not having her is really awful. I’m moving next week to South Carolina to chase dreams of my own, and I will be closer to her. We have made a pact to talk every day and even watch the same shows on Netflix. Hell, we have even made a pact to see each other once a month at the very least. She said she’s not sure if we can ever be back together but we still love each other. She took everything I gave her with her, so that was nice to see. I’m just worried that I just lost her for good, and it kills me. I know I was not perfect, and there are a lot of things I would have done different. I hope we still can after a short time realize that we belong together and pick up where we left off. Has anyone been through anything similar? Do you think we still have a chance? I’m sorry for the rant. She was the person who made me get better, we both met at dark points in our lives and we brought each other back from that. She copes my anxiety and makes everything okay. But today I don’t think this feeling of worthlessness and sadness will ever leave me. I need her back. I need her in my life. And I think she needs me too."

93qje0,490,2018-08-01,I was just convicted of a DUI.,liberal-snowflake,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/93qje0/i_was_just_convicted_of_a_dui/,"Sorry in advance for the long post.

Last year I was arrested for driving under the influence. I had been out drinking at a street festival, downing pints. The party took me back to an apartment, where I dozed off for a bit, before being woken up and driven to my car. Despite the fact I had six or so pints in me, and a bit of scotch, I turned the key and drove off.

I quickly turned the wrong way down a one-way street. Immediately, red and blue lights were flashing in my rear view mirror. I knew I was fucked.

I was handcuffed, my vehicle was towed, and I was taken to the station. The police were antagonistic and aggressive with me. I was terrified and pretty sure I'd just ruined my life. My attempts to blow into the breathalyzer were unsuccessful and I was charged on two counts: driving while impaired and refusal to submit to a breathalyzer.

At the time I had recently graduated top of my class out of a journalism school. I was doing my second internship at major news outlet and was convinced I had just thrown away any chance I had at working in the industry. Not only would the internship not lead to a full-time job, but I was certain I would be fired.

Telling one of my editors that I had been arrested and charged with drunk driving was one of the most difficult conversations I've ever had. I can still remember the way my voice quivered and shook as I spoke. I felt like crying.

He told me it was OK, that he imagined I was going through a very difficult time, and that the company would pay for me to cab around during my shifts so I could continue reporting for them. I couldn't believe my luck. Months later, I found out the editor who I told about my arrest is a recovering alcoholic. When I learned that, the kindness he showed me made sense.

After the internship ended I continued freelancing with the outlet. The DUI charge was pending and I lawyered up. Eventually the outlet brought me on for a contract position, which later turned into a permanent staff gig. This industry is nearly impossible to break into these days, but by straightening myself out and constantly busting my ass, I managed to land the job of my dreams even with a DUI charge hanging over my head. Positive changes pay off and hard work is noticed.

I ended up not only quitting drinking, but also quitting smoking. I've now been sober for 206 days. On top of a job I love, I also started pitching articles to magazines in my spare time and am about to have my first piece published. I moved into a beautiful new apartment in a trendy neighbourhood. The money saved from not drinking or smoking has funded my legal fees and paid my fines, and now I'm quite nearly out of debt. And perhaps most importantly, the time I used to waste in the bottle, I now repurpose into growing myself as an individual.

Today I pled guilty to the DUI in exchange for having the second charge dropped. I stood up, explained to the court that I was doing my best to treat this situation as a life lesson and a character building experience, and that I woudln't ever be back. I got the minimum sentence (one year driving ban) and almost the minimal fine ($1,200).

All told, this whole situation is costing me about $12,000. But I don't care. It's money and it's not the end of the world. When I take a step back from the situation and look at my life as a whole, I realize this will be nothing but a bump in the road. The reality is things could have turned out so much worse. I could have killed someone.

I haven't gone to AA or anything like that. I just stopped drinking. I was in denial about how problematic my relationship with alcohol was for a very, very long time. I excused it as youthful excess. It wasn't. Being arrested was a wake up call. If you're young and wondering if you have a problem, figure it out and make changes if need be before something serious happens and it's too late.

The reality is - at least for me - life is better sober. Nothing good ever has, or ever will, come from alcohol. It's an impediment to me achieving the things I want to in this life, so I have no time for it.

Not driving for the next year will suck, but it's manageable. I've proven myself enough at work that it won't affect my career. I'll take my lumps like a man and move on from this a better person. One year from now I'll be back on the road. And in nine years, when I turn 34, I'll get a pardon and wipe my criminal record clean.

In a weird way, I'm happy all of this happened. I'm fairly certain I wouldn't be sober had I not been arrested. And I wouldn't trade my sobriety for anything.

I will not drink with you today."

93rra0,2,2018-08-01,I accidentally get into Polyphasic Sleep,kuqadk3,polyphasic,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyphasic/comments/93rra0/i_accidentally_get_into_polyphasic_sleep/,"I know about Polyphasic Sleep 3 years ago, with the help of GeneralNguyen (not sure if that guy still active here), i tried it but fail.

Also i love sleep, that time i just got stressing and depression, after that, i think the more i sleep, the calm and sharper mind i am. And it actually good for me. I sleep 10-12 hours everyday, and im still productive.

From a month ago, i got a job, summer internship. Here i am working from 8 - 11h30m AM, 1h30PM - 5h30PM, it's about 7 hours/day. I am not sure which kind of this poly-sleep, but here is my schedule :

After get back to home, i just take dinner, wash the disk, take a bath, all things will be done at about 8h-8h30 pm. I feel really sleepy after eating (dinner, lunch,...). It's more sleepy when i eat much. And it's more sleepy when you got home after 7 hours hard work. So i often end up sleeping at 8h30 or 9pm. I often wake up at 1-2 AM, i cannot sleep more. I read somewhere that 1 hour sleep before mid night is worth 2 hours after midnight. So i sleep about 4-5 hours and feel like it's already 8 hours. I am reading book, learning things, working until 6 AM. And take a short nap about 20 minutes and ready to work. At work, i have 2 hours to rest, i often spend 30 minutes for lunch ( they have buffet inside company so i dont need to go anywhere, the price is a little bit higher than outside company but the quality is good, it feel like you eating at home). And spend 60-90 minutes long nap at company. They provide us a sofa, not really comfortable but it's fine for a nap. So now i often sleep 6-7 hours everyday and have a feeling that i even sleep more than before (before, i often sleep 10-12 hours/day)

Tldr : For those guys out there who want to have Poly-sleep to reduce sleep time, dont ! The more you sleep, the more productive and sharper mind you are. BUT...If you sleep before midnight, i believe 1 hour before midnight is worth more than 2 hours after that. I read some science paper about this, i am not sure if it's right with everyone, but for me, if i sleep after 2 AM, i will end up sleep 10-12 hours and still feel a little bit tire. But if i sleep at 9 AM, i only sleep 4-5 hours but feel great. Also dont wake up too quickly, if you already wake up, just stay in bed and make your mind clear like when you nap for 20 mins. Or do some meditation. Why? I am not sure how things goes with you, but here if i dont do that, i often end up spend my 5 hours reading facebook, playing games. I just spend 20 mins to think of what i am gonna do in that 5 hours.

@GeneralNguyen : if you still remember, i am vietnamese guy pm-ed you few years ago, i added you on facebook too :D"
93saav,11,2018-08-01,Cyber Security major vs CS major with minor in Cyber Security,MetalWood,UTSA,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTSA/comments/93saav/cyber_security_major_vs_cs_major_with_minor_in/,"I've been scouring for the past month about information related to the Cyber Security major and seen a lot of mixed answers about how good it is. I've emailed the Department Chair about this, and he said that the CoB's cyber security program is better than Computer Science's concentration in cyber security.

Yet, most of the posts I've seen related to this question have had comments saying that the CS major with concentration in cyber security was the program that was ranked #1 in 2014.

I'm more inclined to believe the Department Chair since the man has a MS and PhD in CS, but I also would like to hear from people who graduated from the Cyber Security major's program. I'd imagine a degree in cyber looks sketchy to potential employers since my coworkers at this security internship I'm doing right now say that a CS degree is much better (although UTSA may be en exclusion, but I kind of doubt you could explain that on a resume). Ive also heard having an internship is all that matters when getting an entry level job. 

How has it affected your employment after college? Did yall have to get a job as a network admin or a security admin entry level?

I'm heavily considering switching to be a CS major with a minor in cyber security. I just really dont want to spend any more time than I have to in college."

I am looking to apply to PA schools next cycle and would really appreciate some help or advice.

2. I have applied to 4 medical assistant jobs hinting that I am committed, a fast learner, and a hard worker. The only problem is that I can only work part time as I work one job (full day) and have a few more pre reqs to take (Tuesday and Wednesday mornings)... aaaaand I'm not a certified MA, but my I know of people who were trained. I wrote in my cover letter something along the lines of...

""Hello, 

I am responding to your job ad on craigslist. Having just finished my bachelors degree in kinesiology, I am very much interested in pursuing a career as a physician assistant. I have recently finished an internship assisting a chiropractor and I would love to learn more about a doctor's routine as well as how I can assist them. Attached to this email you will find a resume and a couple of recommendations. I have experience working back office, taking vitals and other duties, and I am also a quick learner.

\*Not mentioned in resume\* I have completed courses in Chemistry 1, Bio 1 &amp; 2, Anatomy, Physiology, Exercise physiology, medical terminology, biomechanics, etc."" 

3. What is the best way to get a PA to let you shadow them. I am currently taking the PA's I have connected with on LinkedIn and will try to message them on Instagram or FB, telling them my purpose and how I am reaching out to them through social media because I cannot on linked.

This method slowed a few things down at first but once they got it right it became easier to deal with. There was a new temp expected to start today and by the sound of it a bit younger than most that had been through here already. I had arrived earlier than usual today because of my workload when my door was opened by an intern. He walked in and introduced me to the new hire, a young girl who had just turned 18 a week before.

“Hi my name is [insert name here]” she said as both stood there waiting for my instructions. I looked at him with disdain and pointed at my overwhelmingly overworked desk. They walked out and he began explaining everything to her from what I heard. She sounded ready and determined and answered the phone when it rang. He’d walk in periodically and take the easy work off my desk and show her what she had to do, the more she learned the harder it got. It went like that for most of the day until the next morning.

I got to the office a bit later after almost finishing everything the day before. What I had failed to see yesterday I saw it today as I walked in. She had just filed a document into a folder as I walked by when she greeted me, “good morning!” She said with some enthusiasm as I quickly stared at her short shorts and silky smooth legs. Her outfit a bit unique today after yesterday dressing a bit more conservatively, https://i.redd.it/72jhei4tbu411.jpg. “Good morning, I have more on my desk and drawer if you got the hang of it.” She nodded approvingly and I watched her stand up in disbelief and couldn’t believe she was only 21. At the end of the day she was on the phone outside in visible stress because no one could come pick her up.

I’m looking for long term. Is taking her home my way in with her? Or is it just a ploy? What are her intentions if it’s just a set up no one can come pick her up? 

Ask me for my kinklist."

We've been dating almost two years and I've known him since childhood.

He met his friend, Stella, in a class last year and they became good friends living in NYC for the summer when they were working at the same internship along with a third girl they go to school with.

Now? They're best friends. Apparently she is also still friends with the other girl they were working with but my boyfriend didn't like her that much. I've met Stella twice and she was really, really nice to me. She gave me a big hug hello and didn't hug my boyfriend or anything, just a friendly pat on the head. She talked to me all night long and her own boy toy (not boyfriend) stopped by for awhile to hang out but then left for another party. He told me that he told her when we were having issues for unrelated reasons and her advice was to respect my space that I asked for and that it would work out because he ""clearly loved me a lot."" (We reconciled.)

But what drives me kind of crazy is that they hang out all the time. Like, three or four times a week. They watch movies and shows together. My boyfriend mentioned that Stella has been on-and-off hooking up with one of his roommates for years, and that she and my boyfriend never hug hello or goodbye, and that she always asks how I am doing and to tell me hello. She's really pretty, and they both do a lot of film stuff, and they've become really close so quickly and I just can't help but wonder. I also worry it would be unfair to my boy to ask him to hang out with her less because we were previously in an open relationship (which I asked for) and he said he couldn't handle knowing I was sleeping with other people so we closed it. So I feel like it wouldn't be fair to accuse him of cheating. 

He also told me that one of her parents had an affair and it devastated her which apparently means that she would never involve herself in a cheating scenario. I can't tell if I'm being unfairly jealous.

TL;DR: My boyfriend is really close friends now with a girl he met last year and it kind of bothers me. Not sure if I'm being irrational or not."
93u4wr,2,2018-08-01,Entering Law School - PSLF Loan Questions,Inconnu2022,StudentLoans,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentLoans/comments/93u4wr/entering_law_school_pslf_loan_questions/,"Hello everyone, i'll start with a little background info. (skip to bottom for TLDR)

Got through state school in 4 1/2 years with a small scholarship plus work 30-40 hours a week basically the entire time. I will be leaving with just under $20,000 (as of August 2018, after interest) in all federal student loans split up as;

Date|Loan|Interest
:--|:--|:-- 
2013|$5,500|Direct-Unsub 3.86%
2014|$5,500|Direct-Unsub 4.66%
2015|$2,000|Direct-Unsub 4.29%
2016|$2,000|Direct-Sub 3.76%
2017|$2,339|Direct-Sub 4.45%

I am now entering law school, in state, on a full ride (so no loans for tuition). I will be receiving a $2,500 grant yearly. I have been told that I will not be able to work (in anyway that would net me income worth working towards) for at least my first year, and it has been strongly recommended to me that I not work after that unless it is a school sanctioned externship. So I will be taking out cost of living loans for, most likely, the next three years. I live in an apartment with my fiance (attending undergrad with a full ride, roughly $700 a month in income from internship, graduating with 0 student loans) and another roommate. My fiance and I are responsible for $650 in rent plus utilities (\~$100/monthly). Our only other monthly fees are payments to our parents for keeping us on their phone plans and health/car insurance (we are both under 25 for the next 3 years) which totals $250 a month. Rough budgeting has put us at  $500 a month for food and gas. Which leaves us with;

Monthly Living expenses = \~$1500 for barebones living

Monthly Income = $700

I am being offered $20,000 in direct unsubsidized loans a year. My original plan was to take out $10,000 for the year, which would put us at \~$1700 monthly spending budget after purchasing school supplies for the year. This would leave very little to fall back on if there is an emergency, as well as provide a generally stressful living situation where I would constantly be worried about money if we ever went over budget. It is doable, but my plan is to become a District Attorney or Public Defender out of law school and if I succeed I would be eligible for Public Service Loan Forgiveness. I have used a few calculators online and it appears that there is no difference in total loans paid out between borrowing $55,000\~ and borrowing $80,000 (assuming household income of $90,000 using the average starting income of the two positions my fiancee and I will be attempting to work after graduation)

So my ultimate question (shout out to anyone that read all of that), assuming PSLF survives the Trump presidency in its current form. Also assuming that I make it through law school, pass the bar on my first try, and get a job with the District Attorney's or Public Defender's offices (trust me I know this is A LOT of assumptions). Why would I not pull out $20,000 a year in loans to increase our quality of life, decrease the stress of intense budgeting and living with no safety blanket, and generally help keep me focused and productive during law school? It appears that if I am successful in my path, there will be no difference, as far as total loans repaid, between pulling out $10,000 a year and $20,000. 

TLDR: $20,000 in loans coming out of undergrad into Law School. Being offered $20,000 a year for living expenses during law school. I am only interested in being a Public Defender or District Attorney. Budget says it's possible to only pull out $10,000 a year, but with PSLF calculators, the total paid after 10 years is no different between pulling out $30,000 or $60,000 over three years. Why shouldn't I pull out the full $20,000 to increase my QOL for law school?"
93ubph,40,2018-08-01,Holiday Hell,cariethra,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/93ubph/holiday_hell/,"This happened two years ago. 

I was getting overwhelmed with school, an internship, and basically raising three special needs children by myself (this included about 5-6 appointments a week). DH worked nights and went to school during the day. 

I was burnt out. I mentioned to DH and stupidly MIL, that all I wanted for Thanksgiving and Christmas was to do nothing. I wanted a day off. No running after three kids, no cooking, no cleaning.

MIL said that for Thanksgiving she would make dinner, but it was going to be at her parents’ place. She claimed it was because they had more room. MIL is a disgusting hoarder. She also allows her chickens into the house... 🤢.

She asked DH for the turkey brine recipe. He happily gave it to her and thought that was that. No... oh no. About a week before Thanksgiving, MIL messages DH saying that work has been too hard lately and she doesn’t have the energy to make everything. DH stupidly offers to brine the turkey for her but she has to do everything else.

Now I said DH said HE was going to brine said fowl... but remember he works at night. So who had to brine the damn bird? Yeah me. I did it begrudgingly. 

The next day, we got to GIL’s with the now brined turkey. No MIL. DH calls her to ask where she is. “Oh we are going to be a bit late, one dish took longer than we thought it would. Can you just start the turkey? Oh and did you and [me] make the mashed potatoes?”

DH reminded MIL, that he was exhausted from working a 12 hour night shift and I was supposed to have the holiday off from cooking. 

MIL: “Oh I’m sure she won’t mind. She doesn’t work any way.”

So I spent the next four hours cooking by myself, while trying to keep three young children and a baby entertained. DH tried to be helpful, but he was going to kill himself trying to cook and kept dozing off as he tried to watch he kids. 

GMIL didn’t want the parade or dog show on for the kids. They LOVE the dog show. She did call her daughter (MIL) and asked her to finish the dishes at her house. 

MIL showed up with ONE dish at about 4 pm. 

At which point she complained because I had brought homemade dinner rolls for my middle child who doesn’t eat any Thanksgiving food. She (child) is extremely texturally picky and it just so happens that most of traditional Thanksgiving fair is on her do not eat list. So God forbid that I bring a salad in a bag and dinner rolls so my child has something to eat. 

Why was she in such a tizzy? Because dear sweet SIL decided she can’t have gluten (she doesn’t have celiac or anything else). I would understand if she has a severe allergy like DH, where being in the same room makes his throat itch and start to close. As to why it matters when all she has to do is NOT EAT IT, I have no idea. 

I wish I could have just left right then. I didn’t want to rock the boat further. I was already exhausted and didn’t want to expel the energy to fight her."

The real question is, why am I a secret?

1) You're just plain tired of your love life being front page news on the gossip websites

2) I am scandalously younger than you, maybe not even old enough to drive to see you

3) Officially you're my boss (intern, PA, actor on your first project behind the camera, etc... )

4) We are related. Top choice is brother/sister but open to cousins, aunt/nephew, or even mother/son

5) I live out in some rural small town that could not handle the news you were visiting, much less sleeping with me

6) Some combination of the above. Most of these are not mutually exclusive, and some even work better together

As for kinks and limits, I'm pretty vanilla... specifically into agegaps, incest, cumplay, oral, teasing, body worship, and maybe anal or impreg... but let me know what you're into as long as it's consensual and no scat, gore, blood, bimbo, drug use, non-con, or BDSM as those are my hard limits.
 
Open to either short or long-term scenes, so feel free to PM me anytime you see this.

earlier that day, i had just landed an internship, so i decided to go out to this college bar with a dance floor right outside of campus to celebrate with my girlfriends. we were dancing the night away when i made eye contact with this girl named julia who was in some college organization as my brother (he went to same university as me and was older). we've been introduced in the past before, so since we made eye contact, we walked over to each other to say hello and hug and make the usual small talk like ""so good to see you! you look great!"". i remember her cheeks were red and she was slurring her words a bit. we didn't really know each other, but she was really excited to see me (idk why but girls get excited to see people when they're drunk). i asked her what the occasion was, and she said that she was celebrating her birthday with some friends. she then grabbed my arm and dragged me with her to a small group of her friends - two girls sloppily dancing holding each other and three guys bobbing their heads with beer glasses in their hands. she introduced me to her friends. the two girls looked up to say hi then went back to dancing, clearly not caring to actually be introduced to me. but the three guys were friendlier, and we exchanged names over a handshake. let's call them J, S, and A. after introductions, julia casually took J's arm and slung it around her and leaned against him, so i assumed they were together or seeing each other. oh well, he wasn't the cute one anyway. i was more drawn into S who looked a bit nerdy with his glasses but looked like he had a nice body and arms, i've been told i'm a sucker (heh) for nerds by the way! A was cute too i suppose, he looked like a frat boy, but he didn't have as nice of a body. i spoke (more like shouted over the music) and flirted with S and A for a bit, and we went to take shots together. during our convo, i found out that S and A were best friends from high school (A was visiting, he didn't actually go to the university), and S and J were roommates. and julia and J were seeing each other but not officially dating yet. after a few shots and flirting, S asked me to dance so i said that wasn't fair to A. so i took both of their hands and led them to the small, cramped dance floor (really shitty bar by the way, but this place had $1 fireball shots all night) and grinded on them. it wasn't overly sexual, we were just laughing and fooling around while i was sloppily grinding against both of them.

to visualize, i'm a small asian with B cup tits (but they look like full on C's with blessed push up bras). i've been a closet slut all of high school but became a care-free open slut for most of college. i had on small white forever21 tight tiny camisole dress with spaghetti straps (camisole dresses are def one of my favorite go-out outfits). my dress was scrunching up as i kept grinding on the two, but i pretended to be too drunk/tipsy to notice. i stumbled onto them and said i wanted to go outside for some air. both of them were smokers (i'm a drunk social smoker only) so we all walked out of the bar to smoke and get some fresh air ""to sober up"", my arm linked onto S who was leading the way and holding A's wrists who was walking behind me. i could feel my dress was scrunched up and knew my dress was showing off half of my ass cheeks, but i didn't mind and both S and A certainly didn't tell me. we walked a bit on the street, passing by other bars and restaurants (off campus street with a ton of drunk college students walking around). we turned the corner and walked off the main street, and ended up in an open employer only space behind an empty parking lot of a bookstore. it was dimly lit, from neighboring street lamps. there was a dirty picnic table that S and A sat down on to light a cigarette. i walked over to S and sat on his lap and asked to take a puff of his cigarette. he put his arm around my waist and we stayed like that for a few minutes until we were done smoking. he then playfully started shaking his leg up and down so that i bounced on his leg. we laughed and i played along saying it reminds me of a see saw. as we were flirting and bouncing i remember i had my thighs spaced a little apart when he slid one of his legs in between my thighs and kept shaking his leg higher, so that my legs got more spaced apart (sorry if it's hard to visualize.. idk how else to explain LOL). it got me pretty horny that he was forcing my thighs apart. my dress was pretty much near my hips by this point. A was standing nearby and smoking another cigarette, definitely looked irritated at one point and was occupied with texting someone on his phone (who i found out way later was his gf from his college another state away). we decided to give him some space for now. S kept shaking his leg harder making my boobs bounce up and down in my tight dress and he had his hands around my waist to keep me from falling. i laughed and joked saying that my boobs are going to pop out of my dress if he kept bouncing me. he joked back saying that's what he was going for. i playfully gasped and cupped my boobs with my hands and he gasped too and cupped his hands over mine. i am naturally playful and flirty and he was being really playful back which i liked. i slid my right hand out from under his, so that his right hand was now directly cupping my breast and i gently pulled at his fingers playfully, pretending i was trying to pull his hands off my breasts. this made him grab my right breast tighter. i pulled my left hand out too to do the same, and he grabbed my left breast tighter too. i could feel myself getting wet. as i wrestled his fingers off my breasts, his grip kept getting tighter as we laughed. then i felt his dick harden under me. i leaned back on him and made it clear that i was enjoying him caress my breasts gently. then he started groping them and i could feel my panties getting wet. i was still sitting on his lap, i started breathing heavily as i grinded my pussy on him. he put one hand down my cleavage and clenched my nipple in-between his index and middle finger and slowly rubbed my nipple between his fingers..which MAKES ME GO WILD.. i have really sensitive nipples. i start moaning and i pull down my spaghetti straps and let both my tits fully out, basically begging him to play with both my nipples the same way and grope my tits with the rest of his full hands. i'm so horny now while he's playing with my tits i spread my legs while still on his lap and reach my hand down my panties and rub my clit. S interrupts me by standing up and asks me to lay back on the picnic table. he takes his cardigan off and lays it down since it was pretty dirty. i get up on the picnic table and he spreads my legs and pulls my dress up to my waist, so that now i'm basically almost fully nude outside on top of a table with only my camisole dress scrunched up around my waist. he starts licking my pussy juices that were leaking out of me as i'm moaning and pinching my own nipples. he then whips his hard cock out and starts fucking me right there. A walks back over to us and grins at us going at it on the picnic table. A skips happily over to us then tells S to flip me over. S is still mid thrusting so he tells A to hold on. A gets impatient and gets on the seat and gets near me then starts smacking his dick against my face. it hurt a bit but it turned me on to see A treating me like a slut. he slaps his dick on my face then on smacks it on my tits then my nipples. he didn't ask for a blow job, instead, he put his dick near my mouth and pulled my hair up (my head was back on the table) to lift my head and then told me to suck it. i start sucking A's dick while S is thrusting into my pussy. i was sucking at my own pace when A tells me to suck faster and starts pushing my head down then pulling my hair to pull my head back up. i gag and choke on his cock and my saliva is all over his cock. S seems to get a little concerned that i didn't like it, because he asks A to ""not go overboard"", but in between breaths with my mouth and pussy getting fucked, i tell them to ""use me more"". A grins even wider (didn't think that was possible) and grabs my hair again and slams his cock back into my mouth before i can talk any more. after a few more pumps, S says he needs to cum and pulls out. i would have wanted him to cum inside me (yes i'm on the pill and yes i KNOW it's dangerous) but i couldn't talk with A's dick down my throat. he lightly shoves A's elbow telling him to move, so A pulls his cock out of my mouth and after a split second to gasp for air, S shoves his cock in my mouth and cums inside my mouth. i open my mouth for him to see his cum as i used my tongue to move his cum around and let a little drip out of my mouth. i used my fingers to clean my mess up and licked my fingers. S patted my head as his sign of approval. i almost drooled, i absolutely love when guys pat my head softly especially after getting fucked rough. A then moves to the other side of the table and rams his dick into me, he was bigger than S and he knew how to use it better, he put his fingers around my neck and pounded my pussy hard until i screamed that i was going to cum. he pulled out, slapped my pussy and told me i couldn't cum until he was done with me. i didn't say anything to that, so he tightened his fingers around my neck choking me harder and yelled at me, ""OK?? OK?? You don't get to cum until i'm done with you."" i whimpered and nodded. he loosened his grip and continued pumping his thick cock inside me until he was close to cumming. ""You're gonna take my cum inside that pussy, ok?"", i whimpered and nodded again. after a few minutes he finally came inside me then wiped his dick on my dress and called me a good girl then zipped himself back up. S and J both lit up another cigarette and i laid there on the table for a few more minutes and rubbed my clit and came to the thought that i had just been used as a cum slut on a picnic table behind a parking lot, near the dumpsters. after cumming, i got up from the picnic table and saw my panties ended up on the ground, pretty soiled up, so i didn't want to put them back on. i put my dress back on and we walked back to the bar, with A's cum still inside my pussy with a bit dripping down my thighs.

i went into the bar looking like a mess. my white dress was wrinkled (not that dirty since i was on the cardigan), i had no panties on, my hair was a mess, and my makeup had mostly been washed off by sweat and cum (i wasn't wearing much eye makeup so none of that smudged mascara or raccoon eyes going on). i went back into the bar and had to wait almost 10 minutes in line to the bathroom to wash up a bit. then i went back out to find my friends who were still there but both were dancing with other guys. i couldn't find A and S anywhere after i came out of the bathroom, so i assumed they left or went to another bar. the two drunk female friends of julia were still there, but julia was nowhere to be found as well. i did find J though who was having a beer at the bar (since julia left) and we ended up making out at the bar not too much later. one of julia's drunk friends 'supposedly' saw and told julia BUTTT i don't think they knew it was me so they just told julia that they saw J make out with a random girl. anyway it's a long story but julia and J fought, julia gave J the silent treatment for like a week, me and J fucked three times and did anal once during that week, but then eventually julia forgave J and they ended up officially dating lol. don't think he ever told julia, but i don't mind because that would have ruined my relationship with julia and probably my brother's friendship with julia."

Upon moving to Louisiana and starting my position, I filled out my tax forms and it was suggested I use my address in Ohio (have a temporary apartment in LA for the summer) so my information stays consistent and important mail won't be missed/lost after I move back home.

When I look at my pay stubs, income is being withheld in the state of Louisiana - expected, I'm working here. However, no taxes are being taken out for the state of Ohio - is this correct?

I found this document [here](https://www.tax.ohio.gov/Portals/0/employer_withholding/2018%20year/WTH_WH1_2018_122817.pdf) that lays out the guidelines for Ohio state tax withholding. According to this file I'm not considered an employee for Ohio state income taxing purposes, I believe I'm in the clear - but I'm not entirely sure, my situation might just not me of mention in the file.

Anyone have anything to weigh in on this? I don't want hit with fees or a large tax bill come tax time next year. Thanks!"

93vs9u,72,2018-08-01,"Survived a layoff, but extremely terrified.",tokulord,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/93vs9u/survived_a_layoff_but_extremely_terrified/,"So I just started a job with a small company (less than 15 people) as an engineer about three months ago.  Until today, everything seemed fine, even though we were always busy.  However, about a fourth of my office just got laid off because we weren't selling nearly as many projects as my boss predicted we would.  I was on a team with two other engineers and both of them got canned, so now it's just me and my supervisor.  I was told they chose to keep me over the other two (who had been there a year) because I was learning fast and doing a better job than them, but I'm now concerned that a.) I now have to take on the work of three people, and b.) if there's another ""miscalculation"" by my boss, I'll be next on the chopping block.

I should also mention that  I'm still relatively young and somewhat fresh out of school.  This is the third job I've had after graduating; the first was a 6-month temp, and the second was a permanent job that I got fired from after about nine months.  Given this track record, being let go from another job would not look good, but neither would quitting said job in such a short amount of time.

Should I maybe consider looking for another job just in case shit hits the fan again?

Update: 

Wow, I did not expect so many responses!  Thanks a lot!

I should probably mention that only one of the other engineers I worked with was full-time, the other was a part-time intern still earning his degree.  So I was definitely cheaper than the first guy, but maybe not so much the second guy.  

It looks like a lot of you are in unanimous agreement that I should start looking, so I'll at least brush up on my resume and submit some applications.  "

The story of Princess.",Sorasanna,bridezillas,https://www.reddit.com/r/bridezillas/comments/93wgng/fool_me_once_shame_on_you_fool_me_twice_shame_on/,"(Please keep in mind that this all happened over the course of a year and a half and I    am not sure how to have the flow continue so it may sound like it is bouncing.)

So I    left rather angry after being kicked out of the wedding after being in it for a week and a half, ok, a whole lot of angry. I  walk off before I    say some thing that I’ll regret. I    leave to visit family before I    go abroad to the Czech Republic for a class. I    come back after a weekend at home and a couple weeks later Princess Momo asks me if I    am available to meet up and have brunch with her and the friend who was also kicked out of the bridal party.

I    agree to meet two days before my flight. She opens the door holding her stuffed animal and ushers me into her fiancé’s condo. Her fiancé is wearing a pink frilly apron and apparently made me brunch (I    felt bad for the guy because she made him dress like that to wait on us). Brunch was going fine, then the girl who I    will refer to as the “Hippie” shows up. Princess goes into their second bedroom and brings out these bags. She giggles the entire way through and has us put together these puzzles that ask us to be her bridesmaids and she tells us how much effort she went through to get these done through Etsy on such a short basis. Have you ever seen those proposals that take place at major sporting events on the Megatron? That’s how I     felt. Put on the spot entirely and it would have been awkward to say no. Four sets of eyes watched and waited for my answer. I agreed to take this on and decide she must have just been going through a rough patch when she kicked me out before. 

A few weeks later, I’m out getting coffee with her and I    told her I    was surprised that she wanted me back in since she had kicked me out. She pulls this whole surprised look and says I     never kicked you out. Funny, not quite how it happened in the middle of the restaurant when she told me this. 

She gets the idea in her head that everything wedding related had to be done a year in advance. It was a super stressful time for awhile. I    start a new job at a public accounting firm *yay accounting major now auditor job* and I’m a bit stressed due to the steep learning curve that comes with this and being thrown on a client immediately when I    started. During this time, she went out and purchased a dress (I     don't think it’s very flattering, but she was in love with it and kept showing us pictures of herself in it. I  kept my mouth shut) We proceed to the bridal shop after she got her dress and look at bridesmaid dresses - we had poor service so we agreed to look elsewhere. We ended up purchasing them from a website and order them on Black Friday. We had to make sure to order them at the same time because the company warned that there was a possibility of different dye colors. I    ordered a size up in dress than what I    usually wore thinking it would be fine. I    talked with one of my coworkers and she said that this website was great and just to order a size larger than you usually get.

Three weeks later I     get the dress in the mail. It looks good quality, but I    discovered that it didn’t fit me in the bust (having a large chest kind of sucks). Princess proceeds to send us the type of shoes that she wanted, coincidentally they were discontinued due to terrible reviews and people hating them and had to be ordered online. I    have slightly wide feet and the reviews commented that the shoes were narrow. I    ordered a size up. They don’t fit and all sales were final. Honestly the shoe is as wide as my four fingers grouped together, which isn’t wide enough for my foot or any normal person’s foot. I    give up on trying to find the shoes since we wore long dresses and I    would wear them for the ceremony then take them off for the reception. 

Post Christmas, I    am in the throes of busy season. I    work long hours, get no sleep, and deal with people who hate me. It’s casual. Princess called me every single week of busy season crying. EVERY SINGLE WEEK. Her fiancé couldn’t calm her down so he sent her to me. Thanks Bro, really appreciate that one. She is freaking out about her bridal shower and how she needs a place to go. Her fiancé suggests the club room in my building. I    agree that she can look at it if it makes her shut up. I     apparently seemed really stressed at work so the Partner of the accounting firm pulls me aside to ask me if I    am feeling overworked, and I    explain I’m a bit stressed because one of my friends is having a hard time. She tells me to try and separate work from personal life (definitely fair). I    promise to do better in the future. 

I    return after a grueling week to have Princess show up at my door early Saturday and demand to see the club room of my apartment building. She decides she likes it so we talk to management, book out the room, and start planning. Bachelorette party plans also start coming into work. We agree Door County would be a great place. 

Fast forward again, post busy season so it’s after April 15. One of my coworkers gets laid off due to “overstaffing”. Everyone is worried because shortly after another gets laid off. May 9th I    lost my job and the partner at the firm tells me it is due to overstaffing. Great. I    was out of a job and had bills to pay. I    refrain from telling Princess since I    knew she would call me and tell me about herself. After a week I    told her. She automatically turned it about herself and how she quit her job at the department store and how she was unemployed for three months. Her fiancé supported her and her parents gave her an allowance so she didn’t have to adjust her lifestyle (are you freaking kidding me). Her fiancé ended up taking me out for some scotch and listened to me bitch, explaining that he knew I    needed to vent. On the plus side, I    found a job I    love and has great travel perks a few weeks later!

At the time of the bridal shower the Hippie aka MoH decides to say that she didn’t book the bachelorette after we had been talking about it for over six months. Turns out you can’t book Door County with so little lead time without spending a fortune. The MIA bridesmaid, who might I    mention was IN LOVE with Princess’s fiancé and rushed into getting married as soon as she found out Princess was getting married to the guy she was in love with, spoke up. (FYI Princess has MIA bridesmaid in her wedding to prove that her fiancé is off the market). MIA suggests San Antonio, Las Vegas, and Chicago until I    tell them that the flights would be pricey (again last minute issues). Hippie only planned on spending ~$300 on the entire wedding, um… what. the. Hell. The dress and shoes cost over $150 and she has the bridal shower, bachelorette party, and wedding to go? This isn’t going to work with that little of a budget. 

I    agree to make desserts for the bridal shower, set up, clean up, the whole shebang. We planned on having the party two hours after I    was able to get the key to the club room. Party is at 2:00 and I    planned on getting the keys at 12:00. The office wasn’t open so I     went down at 12:15. No one was supposed to show up. I     told the office who I    was and that I    needed the key for the club room. The intern informs me that some crazy lady pounded on the windows and doors until he answered, then proceeded to scream at him until he gave her the key. He did. I    apologized profusely. Turns out it was Princess’s mother. I    set up decorations, ran up and down the steps to my apartment to retrieve items that I        didn't know we needed.The caterer arrives and is missing food - she’s the delivery girl and maybe 20 years old. Momzilla screams at her and tells her that she better go get her more stuff and that the catering better be free. Poor girl. I    told Momzilla that I    lived next to a grocery store so I    could go buy stuff if needed. I    did. Turns out Momzilla was HIDING food from the caterer. WHO THINKS THAT IS OK???? I    get referred to as bathroom lady the entire time that there are people there since I  trusted none of them with my keys and you needed a fob to get into the main level bathroom. I    ended up running trash down all the time and when I    got back up to the main level, Momzilla thrust an overflowing trash bag into my hands and pushed everyone out the doors. 

I    was pissed. I    received an apology after telling the Fiancé what Momzilla did. I    told the MoH that I    could plan the bachelorette to take some work off her plate (as far as I    knew, everything had been planned months ago then I    had the rug pulled out from under me). She refused my help and said she could handle it. 

One month later, bachelorette party weekend. We travelled to Chicago and were able to stay in the other bridesmaid’s parents’ condo downtown for free. Finally something going well! Then the MoH aka Hippie told Princess that I    would drive her down with me. I    am petrified of driving downtown Chicago and I    told Princess that I    was taking the train for my ease of mind. She wasn’t happy with me that I     planned on doing that, but she couldn’t drive down there because she felt uncomfotrable.

We all met down there, had a nice dinner and drinks, and finally played a ridiculous cat hoarding board game Princess wanted to play. The next morning Princess’s alarm goes off at 6:45 a.m. We told her to shut it off and let us sleep a bit longer. Then proceeded the discussion of birth control and taking it at certain times. I    fell back asleep for 1.5 hours. We made breakfast in bed for Princess and decide to make one (1) penis pancake since it is a bachelorette and will still be respecting the boundary of not having any penis memorabilia. We serve it up to her and she cries.  I    ask her what’s wrong and she tells me nothing. She proceeds to text someone, and I    ask if she is texting her fiancé about how awful we were for the pancake (there wasn’t anything else we did that morning). She informed me that she was texting her therapist, who she got for her mother issues. 

Post breakfast, we shower and dress to go to Michigan Ave. She repeats the same two things throughout the day. As we walk through the shops and listen to her complain about not being paid enough. Princess works maybe 30-35 hours a week, can and does work from home, and is paid approx. $38k. I    think that’s pretty good for someone who sends you junkmail at her company. She repeats this story about ten times so I    zone her out after trying to change the topic. The second topic was how she was happy that her family was the majority of the people coming because they would give so much nicer and more expensive gifts than her fiancé’s family. I’m zoned to an extreme.

We go to lunch at a salad place, I    tried to convince her that we should eat carbs since we were going be drinking later. So we retrieve our salads and head back to the condo so that we can do face masks and craft. Yep, crafting is what she wanted to do. We get back and eat our salads, then she goes to the air mattress, curls up in a ball, and goes to sleep for four straight hours. So much for those face masks. I    wake up after maybe an hour and a half, then I    look at the other bridesmaid and we get coffee since Hippie and Princess are still asleep. No messages from them that they woke up and they were still asleep when we got back. We woke them up for our dinner reservation and headed out. It was a nice rooftop bar where we ate vegetarian small plates and had drinks. I    paid the bill and I    told them we need more of a base, but I      didn't want to spend $60 for four small plates again. 

We head to the condo and order pizza, have a few drinks, and wait until it was dark out. Princess eats half the deep dish spinach pizza by herself.  I     knew salad wouldn’t fill her up at lunch...I      started to change to give them a hint that four of us would take awhile to get ready. They didn’t get the hint. I     get them to get into their dresses: bridesmaids in black and Princess in white. Nothing out of the ordinary. We spot a dive bar that had $3 shots. Holy cow Batman! We go in and they are Kamikazes. The bridesmaids and I    sing and take shots while trying to pull up our reluctant bride to be. People at the bar asked us why she looked so miserable. We couldn’t tell him. We go to two more bars, but they were shot down due to the lines and the cover that had to be paid at the door. Finally end up at one that seems fine. We go downstairs and it is pretty dead, so we headed upstairs. There are at least five other bachelorette parties. Princess sits on the couch and mopes. We buy her a drink and try to get her to dance. I    ask her what’s wrong and she won’t talk. Other brides walk up and give her compliments about how pretty Princess is going to be as a bride. Princess lowers her head and cries some more. 

I    deem it is time to head out. She had been mopey all day and texting her fiancé while he was at his bachelor party. Way to ruin that for him. We immediately go to bed when we get back. I    had an early train to pick up a different friend from the airport the next morning (I  asked Princess if it was ok for me to do that and she said yes a few weeks before this fun time). I    got up the next morning with Princess’s alarm, turned it off, told her to take her birth control, and got ready. I    left $50 on the table to pay for her train since we agreed to pay for that. 

I    talked to the other bridesmaid, who doesn’t have a nickname and is my actual friend, about what happened after. Princess refused to eat, sat and stared at the wall while cleaning happened. My friend carried her bag to the train station and gave her the $50. No thank you. Immediately just left without talking. 

To say we were mad is an understatement. I    debated on texting her and telling her that she was rude and ruined her own bachelorette. I    decided to wait on that one to see if I    would calm down.

Fast forward to yesterday. I    received a three paragraph long text from Princess proclaiming that I    am a horrible person who obviously doesn’t care about her and how awful I    was for the “pancake incident”. I    was officially kicked out of the wedding and was not allowed to be near her since I    obviously am awful. The message was quite rude, especially since I    had a meeting right after I    saw and read this. My friend received the same text verbatim. Now I    am debating on creating an invoice in typical accounting fashion and billing her. We did everything she wanted and paid for it all. No thank you. No smile. It’s over. Her wedding is in a month and she will only have two bridesmaids and her fiancé will have five groomsmen. Oh well, no longer my problem since she is no longer my friend. This is going to be one unbalanced wedding party. I’m thinking of using the dress in the tomato fight. It will be epic. 

-The end!"

93xh66,2,2018-08-02,Suddenly feel awful,the_Space21,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/93xh66/suddenly_feel_awful/,"I’m a 3rd year economics student at a prestigious university. I have good grades. I have a summer internship at a great company that will most likely turn into a part time job in September. I have a family, girlfriend, and friends that I can talk to and meet with. This is precisely the reason I have no idea why this is happening.

When I was in school, I used to be way less sociable than I am now, and so far it has been a pretty positive journey from there to now. Right now I’m trying to pursue a career in sales, and being sociable and confident is a crucial factor here. I do have a little bit of anxiety about cold calling people, but I don’t tend to get nervous in person. However, sometimes the idea of actually setting up meetings, having my own clients in and just working in general in the near future makes me more anxious.

A few days ago this very idea overwhelmed me while I was at work midday. It felt like I had a panic attack, but I think it was mild. It lasted for a few minutes, and then started to go away, getting replaced by a general feeling of helplessness. 

Ever since that happened, I have been losing the battle to get back to my previous state of mind. I have told my girlfriend everything (I always do), and came over to her place once, thinking I would forget all about this, but it just made me feel worse and scared that she either she will leave me or I will push her away. I know I’m supposed to talk to people and be active, but as soon as the thought of going outside to walk with someone crosses my mind, it once again makes my situation worse. 

I have been dodging work, because I’m supposed to convince my employers that I’m good enough to hire in the near future, and I can’t even speak properly right now. It feels like there is a vice clamping my chest and I don’t know how to get it off.

I feel better during afternoons and evenings, but as soon as it gets closer to the time I have to go to bed, thoughts about having to go to work the next day enter my head and I feel worse immediately. 

There are little patches of normality that I experience. This morning when I woke up I actually felt ok, and thought to go to work, but in an hour I was miserable again. During these patches I get my confidence and good mood back, but it doesn’t last long. 

As far as physical symptoms go, I sleep well, but my energy and appetite are affected negatively. I watch youtube and tv shows to get my mind off this, but it doesn’t always work.

What I don’t understand is why the hell this is happening to me. I have everything one could need, and still feel like shit. I feel ashamed, because people experience this when they lose someone, or something terrible is happening in their lives, and yet here I am depressed about nothing.

My only guess is that the fact that I’m soon becoming an adult and graduating from uni overwhelmed me so much that it sent me into this state, because I don’t respond to change very well. But then again, I thought I was fully ready for it. 

I’m scared to death that this might be my permanent state and I don’t know what to do."

Now I'm really tense about whether I would be able to get my EAD card before my start date or not. Super bummed because I was very proud of the amazing internship I got at my dream company, and now everything looks so uncertain. 

Does USCIS only process cases in the order they were received or does it also factor in approaching Employment Start Dates? I seem to have found anecdotal evidence that it does (https://www.trackitt.com/member/zruan1991). 

Can't expedite the process because my case is less than 75 days old (duh) and I contacted my local congressperson who said they can't help because F1 students cannot claim financial stress due to an inability to start working on time.

I just met this girl in early May, been only 2 months together but had tons of moments shared. I didn't expect it to last at the beginning but we really got along quite rapidly.

Anyway, early July I had to leave for the UK for an internship of 6 months (we are from France), and so we didn't see each other for then on. She became distant and expressed her worries for the future, I tried to reassure her. 

The week after she flew to Colombia (for 1 year of exchange), and became even more distant. Tried to call her for days and when I finally reached her she explained to me that she couldn't continue, that our relation was too recent to attempt a LDR and that it was better to stop everything. 

After that, I was left with tons of questions: should we see each other after, did I fuck up ?...

 I asked her to have a last call to clear things out. 

I wanted to know what should I do to clear my mind and enjoy my 6 months in London !

However, this internship wasn’t my first chose. I got an opportunity to do an internship in Asia and everything was arranged for it. Until, about a`` month before the start date, I couldn’t go anymore due to some problems. I felt devastating because, I worked hard to get accepted for the internship in Asia. Then a few days later, I met a professor, whom I previously got some lectures from. He talked with me and suddenly talked about some research institute, which might be interesting for me. I never knew about this research institute before, but they have some research areas which I’m interested in. So, I wrote an email to them and got immediately invited for an interview. During the interview, the person in charge was very positive about me, but he told me, normally they don’t accept interns in this research area. But for me, he would’ve make an exception and I was accepted right away. I was enormous happy, that I could find an internship in such a short time. The next month, I started working there and I met nice colleagues on my department.  I also met, by accident a person from a different department. The person wanted to meet with me after work. The person intrigued me, even I didn’t know much about this person, so I obliviously wanted to meet too.  So, we set up a date and we would meet up somewhere in the city. I was very nervous the day of the meeting. Thinking about want kind of person this is, because I haven’t talked much. We met and would go for some coffee and have a talk. When we talked for a while, it felt very comfortable and familiar. I felt some different connection with this person, something I’ve never experienced before. Normally, I often avoid eye contact with the person I’m talking to, but with this person we could look into each other’s eyes for long periods, without feeling awkward. After more talking, we understand each other more and share similar thoughts. I felt more connected to this person, even in such period I could tell my real feelings and thoughts. I can freely talk and discuss my thoughts without feel being pressured what the other person might think. This person shares also the same religion and we could talked about it freely. I also told this person that I should’ve been in Asia at this time, but due to some problems I couldn’t go there anymore. Then the person told: “I also shouldn’t be here at this time.” The person should’ve been in a different country and never got the intention to work for this research institute. We were both very confused at the time, since we felt an enormous mentally, emotionally and physically connection to each other. It shouldn't be a coincidence that I met this person. The sequence of all these events were atypical. The last few months I prayed a lot to God, giving me guidance in choosing the right path. Since then, I felt only good things on my path. I don’t know what the meaning of meeting this person is, but I leave my faith in God how this would develop further. I thank God I could meet such a wonderful person.  "

93yx34,2,2018-08-02,Year long overseas internship programme vs Economics second major,statscsfanatic21,statistics,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/93yx34/year_long_overseas_internship_programme_vs/,"You could say I'm looking for validation here as I kind of have an answer, but nonetheless I still want to hear what you guys think, especially from professionals who have much more experience than myself.

Spoiler alert: I'm leaning towards the Economics second major. But let me explain my reasons.

To set some background information, both the second major and year-long internship programmes are offered by the school. Meaning I would still pay the same school fees. The extra fees I would be paying for the internship would be the cost of living + airfare + insurance etc etc.

The reason why I'm leaning towards econs is because of my future ambitions. I'm interested in a couple areas, such as fintech, and also things like finance, studying of economies, econometrics. I envision working in a data science role, either in a tech company or finance company. Think Product Manager, Data Analyst, Data Scientist and the like.

On the other hand, the internship is more targeted towards entrepreneurship. The only thing going for it, I guess, is that it is quite popular and often oversubscribed (I heard acceptance rate is 20 - 25%). The locations students can choose from are also quite enticing, such as Silicon Valley / Beijing / New York etc. Once you are accepted, you will self-source for a internship with a tech start-up and settle everything yourself from there. You can also take classes (with a lower academic workload of course) with partner universities during the 1 year there.

My reasons for leaning towards the double major is because I'm not too interested in entrepreneurship, and I also believe that the path of this particular double major combination aligns more with my goals. I envision working in the fields I mentioned earlier, and I feel like even though there is a lot of discussion about how paper certificates are losing their appeal and students should opt for internships, this double major certification would open up more doors for me than a 1 year overseas internship.

I don't know if this matters, but I'm also considering going for a Statistics Master's after gaining some job experience.

What do you guys think? Are my opinions validated? Or am I completely missing the point here?"
93z1fa,16,2018-08-02,Book review: Tess Sharpe's The Evolution of Claire (spoilers hidden and labeled),DotaFish,JurassicPark,https://www.reddit.com/r/JurassicPark/comments/93z1fa/book_review_tess_sharpes_the_evolution_of_claire/,"Having read through the book I decided to make a litte pros (+) and cons (-) list as I haven't seen it discussed much around here, so maybe people are missing out:

\+ The strongest point of the book is probably the long middle part, where we get to explore what it would be like to work in the Jurassic World park. It's really daily life of an JW intern and it's every bit as fascinating as you'd hope.

\- While the beginning is excellently crafted and the middle part has all that exploration going on, the end, while exciting and well written, falls flat in terms of length and feels rushed. It's definitly two chapters too short and \[minor spoiler about last chapter\] &gt;!that's where Claire's ""evolution"" happens, so what the entire book really is about happens too quickly and!&lt; could have been more fleshed out.

\+ The Claire in this book is a very engaging character and it becomes clear from the very start how she could become the Claire of Fallen Kingdom.

\- The book however fails at setting up the Jurassic World Claire. The Claire we get to know here is only part control-freak and organized leader. She's also animal loving, outdoorsy and kind of a geek. Not the uptight bussiness woman we meet in the movie. She also didn't come across as someone who'd completely abondon their family like we see in the movie.

\+ We get a cast of diverse and fun characters and the one's we already know from the movies are very recognizable and well written.

\- While the book features many well written female characters, I found some of the feminism to be clumsily written into the plot. It felt out of place and sometimes outright dumb. That is not okay, as feminisn is a serious topic that has to be done properly. The worst example of this would be \[minor spoiler about a rather important little speech Claire gives\] &gt;!when Dr. Wu asks Claire why she thinks they had to change their approach to filling the gaps in the DNA she randomly inserts a line about how women have to fight against society and find a way, like nature does. Like.. what? What does that have to do with anything?!&lt; And somehow Dr. Wu is impressed by that. To me, that's the lowest point of the book. Especially as it doesn't end there and the entire speech is a mess. &gt;!With the on the nose copy of Ian Malcolm's 'Nature finds a way.' and a complete misunderstanding of at what timeframes evolution applies. Then she somehow arrives at the conclusion that a mishandling of dinosaur DNA could end with the exctinction of the human race. Oh man.!&lt;

\+ While not many different dinosaurs are featured in the book, those that we get to meet are well done and exciting.

\- This is a minor thing, but writing that Claire could do ""the snow angel thing"" in a Brachiosaurus's footprint shows that the author didn't bother to fact check. Apparently Claire is 1 meter tall.

\+ There's a mystery element throughout the book that keeps you reading glued to the book.

\- When things eventually go bad in the story (not quality wise), the book continues in Jurassic World fashion of hard to believe circumstances. It doesn't bother one much while reading, as the author does a great job of getting you cought in the moment, but when thinking it over again questions start to accumulate.

\- The antagonist Wyatt is a bit over the top and can be very annoying at times. He's just the embodiment of everything bad in the world and made of pure asshole. Talk about a one-dimensional character.

\+ Apparently the author, Tess Sharpe, worked close with Universal to ensure that the book stays in line with the rest of the canon and did a good job of fitting the story into the world. Any Jurassic Park fan should be satisfied here and it's noticable that there was a good amount of quality control. They cared and it shows.

In conclusion I would highly recommend the book to any Jurassic Park fan, alone for the experience of interning at Jurassic World. Keep in mind that it's a young adult book and that becomes rather noticeable at times. Happy reading!"

I'm pretty average when it comes to maths and sciences. It feels like everyone in my personal life is doubting my abilities and it's really affecting me mentally. I've made sure to expose myself in the tech industry by joining stem programs,learning on my own, attending hackathons, etc. I've mentored coding camps and even became a panelist for a conference but no matter what I do, I feel like it's never enough. I know a few guys of the same age who have real experience like an internship and if not, practice regularly on leetcode. Uni hasn't even started and yet, I feel so unqualified. 

 I understand that I don't have to be perfect in order to be successful but I just can't shake the feeling of needing to be perfect. I just want to inspire other girls just as my role models have inspired me.

I'm deeply afraid that I'll get overwhelmed and drop out of the program. This is my dream and it makes me so stressed that I might become one of those girls who can't handle the workload. I'm honestly so dumb but I don't want to encourage any stereotypes that girls are bad at math etc

So girls in compsci, have you ever felt this way and how did you deal with it?"

I used it once. My parents paid it off for me. I have not used it since. I have an EXCELLENT  credit score. I am going to be starting work for campus at my university making $8.50/hr and working between 9 and 20 hours a week. I do not have a car and I really need one because my university is in a big city and in an area that isn't really all that safe. I also would like to start looking for internships but I don't want to have to take the bus everywhere because it is slow and not a reliable method of transportation. I also cannot use uber because...well there goes my whole paycheck. So, a car would be super convenient, and yes I understand insurance and gas and registration and car payments but, honestly, I feel like it would be worth it in the long run. 
 
Honestly I just want to know what I should do. Should I buy a used car? (Looking around 10-13k). Should I wait? I just want some advice on how to proceed. I'm going to be a sophomore in college and I really need to start making connections. I can't keep asking for rides.

Also: my parents have made the offer to pay either a. The downpayment for a car or b. Match me in paying exactly half of the cost of a vehicle. 

I currently have 5.4k in savings. I am paying $715/month for rent. 

Edit: added savings. "

93zp7s,3,2018-08-02,"About to pass CMA, what kind of raise can I expect?",JayZeld,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/93zp7s/about_to_pass_cma_what_kind_of_raise_can_i_expect/,"Hey all!

So after about six months, I'm finally about to pass the CMA. Already passed part one in May, and I am pretty sure I aced part two. I should find out in about a week or so.

My question is; what kind of raise (if any??) should I be expecting. A few facts about my situation:

I'm a staff accountant, working for a mid-sized manufacturing company in Ohio. I currently make $56k per year, and I have about 2.5 years of experience, all with this company (not including my year of internships for a CPA firm). I have two bachelor's degrees, one in Finance and one in Accounting. I'm the first one in our accounting team of 7 to get his CMA, so there's no precedent set. Two people in our organization have their CPA currently (CFO and controller, my manager). Both have talked about how they got a raise, and a promotion, after passing the CPA. I know they're not directly comparable, but still.

Any thoughts on what kind of raise I should expect or ask for? I'm thinking of shooting for about $65k total ($9k raise). Is that too high? I work hard, but I don't know how much of that my manager sees, since he has a lot of projects going on at the moment. I try to market myself as much as possible without coming off as self-absorbed.

Any input would be appreciated!"
940g9e,5,2018-08-02,Acceptance and then rejection from family?? Idk how to title,maomaokittykat1,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/940g9e/acceptance_and_then_rejection_from_family_idk_how/,"I come from a family of generational trauma. I know that my mom was treated terribly by her mother, and my grandmother by her mother, and it probably goes on from there. I'm looking for advice on how to approach a relationship with a family member that's in a weird place right now.

My great aunt, who also was traumatized by my great grandmother, took my mom in when she was younger. For my whole life, I have been closer with this great aunt than my grandmother and she fulfilled the typical grandmother role. I distinctively remember opening up to my aunt multiple times throughout my preteen/early teen years telling her how bad things were for me at home. I think she had rose-colored glasses when it came to my mom and she would always tell me, ""She can't argue with you if you don't argue back"". I think this is part of the reason I never told adults what was going on when I was growing up. I was, and still am, convinced that I was doing something wrong and if I told them how my mom treated me they would then consequentially find out how bad I was and that I deserved it all. Anyway, when I was 16 I moved in with my boyfriend after things with my mom hit a breaking point, and when my aunt found out she said that she was so hurt that I hadn't reached out to her. At the time, I reminded her that I did try to reach out and  she said that I never made it seem that bad. Of course that hurt and I didn't talk to her for a long time after that.

Anyway (again), I am now 21 years old, and go to school far away from home. I hate returning because going back home is too much. However my great aunt asked me to come home for Christmas this winter so I did, even though I knew it might not be great for my mental health I guess. When my mom cancelled on meeting for lunch just because she was in a mood, and she never gets to see me, I just broke down crying and my aunt said something about how I shouldn't let my mom get to me. I immediately got angry and felt like I needed to justify myself, but also in retrospect I think I wanted my aunt to feel bad for what she said, so I told her all of the worst details of what I experienced growing up - the especially awful, grotesque details that makes peoples skin crawl more than just finding out my mom was vaguely emotionally abusive or neglectful. Anyway the rest of the trip was spent with my aunt telling me how she couldn't believe it, how disappointed she was in my mom, and in particular how similar her childhood was to mine. Also, of course, how I ""should have told her"" (my gut wrenches every time I write this - that she thinks I didn't tell her - because it makes me so sad/angry). She's not a big drinker, but once I told her all of this she started getting drunk every night which was triggering for me but I tried to be understanding and didn't judge. Overall the whole thing was exhausting but ultimately I felt validated.

A couple weeks after I got home from the trip, I called her and she was super cold on the phone and she asked me some questions that were almost accusatory in nature - like she didn't believe what I had told her about my mom or something. I got off the phone feeling like absolute shit but my partner reminded me that she's probably just emotional because this brought up a lot of stuff for her too. However in the next phone call she was being equally mean to me, and this is completely unlike her typical behavior. Without me bringing anything up regarding my childhood (I hadn't wanted to talk about it again since leaving) she told me that she 'deals' with her problems  and doesn't need to talk to anyone about it, and I need to deal with my problems and manage my ptsd better and stop dwelling on the past. Obviously I felt like shit and still feel like shit about the whole thing.

Before I told her anything, my aunt gave me $1000 (gift, not a loan) to help me get professional clothes for my internship and some money to use when I was studying abroad \[I also want to make clear that outside of occasional gifts, I am completely monetarily independent and function as an independent adult without help from family\]. My whole family is poor and this is a lot of money for us. Because of this, but also just the role my aunt has played in my entire life, I feel indebted to her and that I need to maintain our relationship. I got her some gifts while abroad even though I didn't feel like it after she made me feel so awful this winter. I need to mail them but I'm dreading it. I think I should call her, because she gets irritated when I don't call her after awhile, but I don't want to and I'm also dreading it. I'm in such a good place right now with my mental health and I am terrified of dealing with all of this. I live on the other side of country and I love being far away from all the people  and places of my past. I don't want to call and get sucked back in again. Someone not believing my trauma is my ultimate trigger. I can't handle it. I don't need to prove to anyone what happened to me, I fucking experienced it. I guess I just want advice on how to approach this situation and protect myself but also repair things with my aunt."

Deelt u de mening dat het extra wrang is dat er veel oud-defensiepersoneel werkt of werkte in de PI Ter Apel, mensen die in een vorig dienstverband al in aanraking zijn gekomen met Chroom-6, die hier nu nogmaals mee geconfronteerd lijken te worden?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 11  
&amp;nbsp;    
Wordt of werd er ook in andere penitentiaire inrichtingen gewerkt met Chroom-6?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord vraag 1, 2 en 11  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het artikel over het mogelijke gebruik van Chroom-6 bij de arbeid in de PI Ter Apel is mij bekend. In verschillende penitentiaire inrichtingen wordt bij de arbeid hout bewerkt, zoals het in elkaar zetten van tuinschermen en tuinpoorten. Hout dat bewerkt wordt voor gebruik in de buitenlucht moet worden verduurzaamd om het bestand te maken tegen de invloeden van weer en wind. In sommige gevallen gebeurt dat met chroombestanddelen. De werkzaamheden betreffen onder meer het aan elkaar schroeven van houtdelen en in beperkte mate het verzagen ervan. Voor die laatste categorie bewerkingen van met chroombestanddelen verduurzaamd hout worden met het oog op de risico’s voor de gezondheid veiligheidseisen gesteld.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ik kan mij goed voorstellen dat personeelsleden en gedetineerden die mogelijk betrokken zijn &amp;#40;geweest&amp;#41; bij de verwerking van met chroom verduurzaamd hout zich zorgen maken. Personeel en gedetineerden hebben recht op een veilige werkplek. Ik realiseer mij dat dit voor een extra onzekerheid zorgt bij het personeel dat in een vorig dienstverband in aanraking is gekomen met Chroom-6. Onzekerheid over de vraag of er eventuele gezondheidsrisico’s zijn geweest, en zo ja in welke mate, vind ik onwenselijk. Ik wil die onzekerheid dan ook zo snel mogelijk wegnemen.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Er zijn mij op dit moment geen gevallen bekend van gezondheidsklachten van &amp;#40;oud-&amp;#41;medewerkers of &amp;#40;ex-&amp;#41;gedetineerden van de PI Ter Apel specifiek met betrekking tot Chroom-6. Tot nu toe heeft één oud-medewerker uit de inmiddels gesloten PI Hoogeveen zich met gezondheidsklachten gemeld. Op dit moment is nog niet duidelijk of die klachten verband houden met blootstelling aan Chroom-6. Deze zaak is momenteel in behandeling. Ik kan daar geen nadere mededelingen over doen.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Behalve in de PI Ter Apel werd ook in de PI’s Vught, Leeuwarden en Middelburg gewerkt met hout dat is verduurzaamd met chroomhoudende bestanddelen. Uit voorzorg is inmiddels met de leveranciers afgesproken dat alleen hout wordt geleverd dat niet is verduurzaamd met chroombestanddelen. Verder is gebleken dat ook in de inmiddels gesloten penitentiaire inrichtingen in Hoogeveen en Breda in het verleden is gewerkt met verduurzaamd hout.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 3  
&amp;nbsp;    
Is van deze groep gedetineerden wel in de gaten te houden of mensen gezondheidsklachten krijgen, gelet op het feit dat het hier ‘Vreemdelingen in het Strafrecht &amp;#40;VRIS&amp;#41;’ betreft? Hoe worden deze mensen die na hun straf uitgezet worden in de gaten gehouden?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord vraag 3  
&amp;nbsp;    
Zoals aangegeven in het antwoord hierboven zijn mij geen gezondheidsklachten bekend met betrekking tot Chroom-6 van vreemdelingen die in de PI Ter Apel zijn of waren gedetineerd. Indien vreemdelingen zich alsnog melden met gezondheidsklachten die mogelijk het gevolg zijn van blootstelling aan Chroom-6, worden deze klachten onderzocht. Het ministerie van Justitie en Veiligheid volgt in zijn algemeenheid niet of vreemdelingen die inmiddels zijn teruggekeerd naar het land van herkomst of naar een ander land zijn vertrokken gezondheidsklachten krijgen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 4  
&amp;nbsp;    
Wordt er vandaag de dag nog steeds met hout gewerkt dat is verduurzaamd met Chroom-6? Zo ja, waarom? Welke gezondheidsrisico’s levert dat op voor de werknemers die in het buitenland dit hout moeten impregneren?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord vraag 4  
&amp;nbsp;    
Uit voorzorg is inmiddels met de leveranciers afgesproken dat alleen hout wordt geleverd dat niet is verduurzaamd met chroombestanddelen. Op het verduurzamen van hout is de Europese Verordening ‘REACH’ van toepassing. Deze verordening geldt voor alle bij de EU aangesloten landen en heeft tot doel de gezondheid van de mens en het milieu beter te beschermen tegen de risico's die chemische stoffen kunnen opleveren. Op grond van deze verordening zijn bedrijven verplicht de risico's die zijn verbonden aan de stoffen die zij in de EU vervaardigen of in de handel brengen te identificeren en te beheersen.   
&amp;nbsp;    
In een veiligheidsinformatieblad dienen bedrijven die het verduurzaamde hout leveren aan te geven hoe het hout veilig kan worden verwerkt en welke risicobeperkende maatregelen dienen te worden getroffen. Daarnaast zijn leveranciers van verduurzaamd hout in Nederland verplicht bij elke lading een KOMO-certificaat te verstrekken. Het KOMO-certificaat betekent dat een certificerende instelling bij het bedrijf dat het hout verduurzaamt, heeft getoetst of het betreffende bedrijf zich houdt aan wettelijke regels en milieunormen ten aanzien van het productieproces en de gebruikte verduurzamingsmiddelen.    
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 5  
&amp;nbsp;    
Kunt u aangeven hoe wordt gecontroleerd of Chroom-6 aanwezig is in het hout dat gebruikt wordt tijdens de dagbesteding? Wordt elke lading hout op Chroom-6 gecontroleerd of gebeurt dit slechts steekproefsgewijs? Kunt u uw antwoord toelichten?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord vraag 5  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bij binnenkomst van elke lading verduurzaamd hout in een PI dient te worden gecontroleerd of een vrachtbrief en een KOMO-certificaat zijn bijgevoegd. Het verduurzaamde hout wordt tevens steekproefsgewijs gecontroleerd op de aanwezigheid van Chroom-totaal, niet specifiek op Chroom-6. Het bewerken van hout dat verduurzaamd is met chroomhoudende bestanddelen is aan regels gebonden met het oog op het beperken van de gezondheidsrisico’s. Bij deze werkzaamheden wordt waar voorgeschreven gebruik gemaakt van afzuigingsinstallaties om blootstelling aan risicovolle stoffen te beperken. Daarnaast is het gebruik van persoonlijke beschermingsmiddelen, zoals handschoenen en mondkapjes, verplicht.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 6  
&amp;nbsp;    
Kloppen de resultaten uit het rapport dat in bovengenoemd artikel wordt genoemd, namelijk dat er te hoge doses Chroom-6 zijn aangetroffen in de PI Ter Apel? Zo ja, waarom is dit rapport nooit openbaar gemaakt? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord vraag 6  
&amp;nbsp;    
In 2014 is in opdracht van de PI Ter Apel een zogeheten Aanvullende risico-inventarisatie- en evaluatie &amp;#40;RI&amp;E&amp;#41; uitgevoerd naar aanleiding van wijzigingen in de wijze van houtbewerking in de PI Ter Apel. Dit is het rapport waarnaar in het artikel van De Telegraaf wordt verwezen. Onderdeel van deze RI&amp;E was een onderzoek naar gezondheidsrisico’s die het gevolg kunnen zijn van het bewerken van met chroombestanddelen verduurzaamd hout. Uit de metingen bleek dat de blootstelling aan Chroom-totaal beneden de toenmalige grenswaarde van Chroom-6 lag. Niettemin heeft de PI Ter Apel op 18 november 2014 met de leverancier afgesproken dat voortaan geen hout meer zou worden geleverd dat is verduurzaamd met chroomhoudende bestanddelen. Op verzoek van de leverancier is de PI Ter Apel eind 2015 evenwel akkoord gegaan met het weer bewerken van hout dat is verduurzaamd met een chroomhoudend middel. Het ging hier om een verduurzamingsmiddel dat volgens de bijgeleverde ‘Geschiktheidsverklaring Houtverduurzamingsmiddel’ in Nederland was toegestaan.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Op 18 november 2016 werd de PI Ter Apel geïnformeerd over de resultaten van een tweede Aanvullende RI&amp;E die op grond van de arboregelgeving is uitgevoerd. Als onderdeel van deze RI&amp;E zijn vier metingen gedaan naar de blootstelling aan Chroom-6 in de ademzone. Deze vier metingen waren lager dan de toen geldende grenswaarde voor Chroom-6 &amp;#40;10 microgram per m3&amp;#41;, maar wel hoger dan de grenswaarde voor Chroom-6 die later – op 1 maart 2017 – van kracht zou worden &amp;#40;1 microgram per m3&amp;#41;. Tevens bleek uit dit rapport dat adembeschermingsmiddelen en handschoenen niet in alle gevallen volgens voorschrift werden gebruikt. In aanvulling op dit rapport is ook een meting uitgevoerd naar de mate waarin chroomhoudende bestanddelen in het verduurzaamde hout voorkwamen. Omdat een te hoge concentratie Chroom in het hout werd aangetroffen, zijn de werkzaamheden tijdelijk opgeschort. Daarop is met de leverancier afgesproken om voortaan geen hout meer te leveren dat verduurzaamd is met chroomhoudende bestanddelen. Op 26 juni 2018 is evenwel bij een controlemeting gebleken dat het geleverde hout toch verduurzaamd was met chroomhoudende bestanddelen. Daarop heeft de PI Ter Apel de werkzaamheden opgeschort.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Gelet op de risico’s die kunnen voortvloeien uit het verwerken van met chroombestanddelen verduurzaamd hout, heeft DJI uit voorzorg besloten dat voortaan in geen enkele PI meer gewerkt zal worden met dit type hout. Hierover zullen scherpe afspraken worden gemaakt met leveranciers. De frequentie waarmee houtladingen worden gecontroleerd, zal voorlopig fors worden verhoogd. Indien blijkt dat een leverancier niet in staat is de verscherpte afspraken na te komen, zal ik in het uiterste geval de samenwerking beëindigen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Een RI&amp;E is een intern rapport dat bedoeld is om na te gaan in hoeverre voldaan wordt aan de arboregelgeving en welke verbetermaatregelen dienen te worden getroffen. Het is niet gebruikelijk om een dergelijk rapport actief openbaar te maken.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 8  
&amp;nbsp;    
Is het waar dat het geïmporteerde hout vlak naast de gevangenis wordt bewaard, omdat dan het impregneermiddel goed zou kunnen opdrogen, zodat het later tijdens het zagen niet meer schadelijk is? Kunt u zich voorstellen dat hierover grote zorgen bestaan? Hoe zit dit precies?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord vraag 8  
&amp;nbsp;    
In de PI Ter Apel wordt het aangevoerde verduurzaamde hout buiten opgeslagen en afgedekt. Dat is onderdeel van de veiligheidsvoorschriften. Gelet op de gezondheidsrisico’s van de blootstelling aan Chroom-6, kan ik mij voorstellen dat men zich zorgen maakt over de opslag van met Chroom verduurzaamd hout. De opslag van verduurzaamd hout zorgt echter niet voor gezondheidsrisico’s, omdat Chroom-6 niet verdampt, waardoor er geen Chroom-6 vrij komt tijdens de opslag.  Chroom-6 wordt in hout grotendeels omgezet in Chroom-3. In met chroomverbindingen verduurzaamd hout is daarom voornamelijk Chroom-3 aanwezig. Anders dan Chroom-6 is Chroom-3 niet schadelijk voor de gezondheid.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 7  
&amp;nbsp;    
Begrijpt u de zorgen van het gevangenispersoneel, onder andere vanwege het feit dat de productie eerder ook al is stilgelegd, omdat er een gevaarlijke partij hout zou zijn aangetroffen? Hoe zit dit precies, om welke risico’s ging het hier?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 9  
&amp;nbsp;    
Kunt u het gevangenispersoneel en de gedetineerden geruststellen dat zij op dit moment niet blootgesteld worden aan hogere doses Chroom-6 dan uit gezondheidsoverwegingen veilig is? Zo ja, op welke manier? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 10  
&amp;nbsp;    
Kunt u het &amp;#40;oud-&amp;#41;gevangenispersoneel en de &amp;#40;ex-&amp;#41;gedetineerden geruststellen dat zij in het verleden niet blootgesteld zijn aan hogere doses Chroom-6 dan uit gezondheidsoverwegingen veilig is? Zo ja, op welke manier? Zo nee, bent u bereid grondig en onafhankelijk te laten onderzoeken of in het verleden personeel en gedetineerden blootgesteld zijn aan te hoge doses Chroom-6?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord vraag 7, 9 en 10  
&amp;nbsp;    
Zoals aangegeven in het antwoord op vraag 1, 2 en 11 kan ik mij goed voorstellen dat personeelsleden en gedetineerden die mogelijk betrokken zijn &amp;#40;geweest&amp;#41; bij de verwerking van met chroom verduurzaamd hout zich zorgen maken. Uit voorzorg is met de leveranciers afgesproken dat voortaan geen hout meer wordt geleverd dat is verduurzaamd met chroomhoudende bestanddelen. Desalniettemin kan ik niet uitsluiten dat het personeel en gedetineerden in het verleden zijn blootgesteld aan hogere doses Chroom-6 dan de hiervoor geldende norm. Ik vind het belangrijk om hierover duidelijkheid te verschaffen voor &amp;#40;oud-&amp;#41;medewerkers en &amp;#40;ex-&amp;#41;gedetineerden. Ik heb daarom het Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu &amp;#40;RIVM&amp;#41; verzocht na te gaan of, en zo ja hoe, hier meer duidelijkheid over kan worden verschaft. Het RIVM heeft aangegeven dit onderzoek in september 2018 te kunnen beginnen. Het onderzoek zal naar verwachting van het RIVM een doorlooptijd hebben van circa zes maanden, waarna kan worden bepaald of een vervolgonderzoek mogelijk en noodzakelijk is. Zodra de uitkomsten bekend zijn zal ik uw Kamer hierover informeren.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Goede communicatie met medewerkers en gedetineerden acht ik van groot belang. Medewerkers kunnen met hun vragen in de eerste plaats terecht bij hun vestigingsdirecteur en bij arbodeskundigen binnen DJI. Daarnaast worden er voorlichtingsbijeenkomsten gehouden voor medewerkers en gedetineerden als daar behoefte aan is.

9426f8,1,2018-08-02,Tonight’s Rain and Rush,paracosmicmind,u_paracosmicmind,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_paracosmicmind/comments/9426f8/tonights_rain_and_rush/,"Finally, after all the heat and struggle that we’ve been through, rain pours unto us to cleanse us from this horror.

These days have been hard. I kept talking about heatwave recently. It did hit us hard here in Europe. The scientists and most people always claim that every year is the worst heatwave of all time. But it’s true. You can’t deny it anymore.

Here I am, sitting by the window of my small apartment in Dresden, Germany, enjoying the music nature has always given to us since the dawn of mankind. You can live without food for several weeks, Mahatma Gandhi managed to survive starvation for around three weeks, but without water, a week seems to be at most.

As I live and die by the grace of God, it never crossed my mind that human being is really fragile. Every day we complain to something. Small little things that we can always fix, yet we chose to complain and blame. At least the German complain and fix it right away, but most people don’t. I am not being a hypocrite, I admit that sometimes I complained a lot too. It’s our nature I guess.

I’d say that we should be a bit more grateful to what God has to offer to us, this Earth, this Nature, even music.

There’s one thing I notice living in a developed country. I feel ‘out’ of place. The individuality can be too much sometimes. In the time between my break up and until now, I was spending my time alone. I was living life that was rather unreal. I hardly knew anyone, barely went out. I’d get up at 5 in the morning, go to the office with my supervisor, driving the car from Dresden to Hainichen, auditing the energy activities in the company, stop by the supermarket on the way home, and eat dinner at home alone. At least, that’s how my routine is. Then put on my speaker, sit back and relax.

I strongly believe that music is there as an entertainment for us human being to be not bored by the harsh reality of life. As of now, I’m listening to [Night Moves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ae1s-Cv9KSg) by [Roosevelt](http://www.iamroosevelt.com/). It’s just perfect for the time, easy-listening tune to wrap up the day. I do feel like that Indie can sometimes be really underappreciated. But he stood up among the crowd.

The rain just stopped. Cool breeze has finally entered my room. [Sweetness Alive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGum4qq6AA8) is now playing through the UE Megaboom.

I enjoyed writing in my small room accompanied by my speaker. There is always this adventurous sensation when you discover a new music. You feel this kind of ‘rush’ sensation. It’s the same as when you sip your morning coffee at 8:30, in the breakfast cellar of your office, listening to your colleagues conversing about their family. That first sip always hits hard to begin your day.

The same thing when you smoke your first cigarette of the day, after lunch time in a guest house by the train station. The chef has always been creative the first day I began my internship. Due to my belief, I refused to eat pork, so I had to politely decline their daily menu and ask for an alternative. Being in East Germany, I always fear to be discriminated, especially when you are actually in a small city.

They proved me wrong.

The chef came up with a lamb meat served with potato and boiled vegetables. That menu was supposed to cost 8 Euro, but she decided that I should only pay for the daily menu price, which was half the price. Since that day on, she always came up with something else when the daily menu was pork.

Smoking is never really my favorite. But I had to do it sometimes, breaking up is a tough business. It’s necessary sometimes to keep me sane through the day. But that first puff was always the best, and came that ‘rush’.

That’s the same for me when I listen to a new music unheard of.

This is how I feel every time. Or when you open up your music gallery and find that old music again.

Suddenly I felt joy knowing that there are so many pieces of music I’ve never heard of, waiting to be discovered by my curious ears.

We finally got the chance to hang out. He was really talking a lot and  so was I. He hardly used his phone. We gave each other a lot of eye  contact and sat really close. He gave me a really tight and long hug  when I was like “last time u gave me a heart attack”. And than I had an  exam (we both go to the same university, he's doing an internship ATM  and I was doing school) so he walked me to that and gave me a hug right  before I entered the elevator and said ""good luck.""

After  that we talked but it was nothing compared to before and I felt the  difference. They were still flirty and playful. Sometimes he would  respond in less than 5  mins, 15 mins or 1 hour. I feel like currently  he doesn't respond to me as frequently and as fast as he did a while  back. Anyways I confronted him about it and straight up told him how I  felt. Honest and to the point.

Here's what was said:

What  I said: I enjoy talking to you. I think I can see myself being with  someone like you, and you make me feel happy. I’m not saying we have to  rush into anything right away. Not sure if you want to continue talking  and see where things head  or if yesterday you didn’t feel the chemistry  and lost interest. 😳😳😳 I’m not saying that we have to rush into a  relationship right away because I prefer to go with the flow myself

His  response: Yeah we can take the time to see if it will work,and tbh  yesterday i felt something but at the same time i constantly feel that  im not ready yet to give much time to another person u know. Even my  friends i just dont see them

BTW I am by  no means looking to be in a relationship immediately. I do like him but  whenever someone ignores me it kills the vibe. Does his response seem  reasonable?

I don't know if I should put up with this or just leave him?

Should I delete him/ ghost?

Should I be distant back to him (no contact) and give him some time?

**TLDR**:  He was extremely lovey dovey at first, we finally met up and it seemed  to go well, he became more distant compared to before but still flirty,  confronted and he said he is interested but doesn't get to have much  free time (for now)."

942xw7,1,2018-08-02,Need Help Determining What Statistics/Methods to Use: proving a current sample size is inefficient and too small to use based on our population size (long read but please help),thenickydshow,AskStatistics,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskStatistics/comments/942xw7/need_help_determining_what_statisticsmethods_to/,"Good afternoon r/askstatistics, and I want to thank all of you who take the time to read this and try to help.
I work for a biotech company and I, the intern, have been tasked with determining an optimal sample size to be used by our QC team. Currently we use a sample size of 20 ""tubes"" (the product) as a first step in QC inspection. If 1 of the 20 tubes fails, another 20 tubes are tested and if that test yields no failures of the second 20, the ""lot"" (population) of tubes passes and can go into final production to be sold. If a tube in the second set of tubes fails inspection, just 1 (similar to the first 20), the lot fails and cannot be sold. Essentially if 2 tubes of the 40 tube sample fail, the lot of 1200 or 2400 tubes also fails and are wasted.

Some important info here is that our lot sizes range from 800 tubes to 2800 tubes. For this examples sake/my upcoming presentation's sake we are using two lot sizes, 1200 and 2400. 

I am looking to convince some of our senior members that our current sample size is too small, especially on our large lots (2400) and we are failing too many lots because we are not considering an appropriate margin of error (failure). What statistical approach could I take to help my case?
My proposed approach is to initially test 40 tubes and allow up to 2 to fail inspection (5% margin of error/failure being acceptable) and if 2 do fail inspection, we introduce a second set of 30 tubes and if 1 of those 30 tubes fails, then the lot fails.
(I got my new suggested sample size (70) from http://www.raosoft.com/samplesize.html )
In essence, we go from an acceptable failure rate of 5% on a sample and up the ante if it is running the risk of failing to 3.33% to ensure that the determining sample is a good tell for the lot.
Is this a statistically sound approach or do I need an even larger sample size for such large populations (lots)? Please let me know if there is a good approach to this or some formulas that I can use to give me a more accurate representation of the lots via samples and their sizes.

****I just visited http://www.raosoft.com/samplesize.html and realized that I had unknowingly set the response to 5% instead of 50% (normal), upon fixing it, the website suggests a sample size of 292 on a 1200 tube lot and 332 for a 2400 tube lot. I guess at this point only consider my 70 tube sample as a potential low ball for the QC change. Regardless I need to know if there is a means to back this with formulas and calculations that will change the mind of the seniors at my company.
Thank you to those who can help!"

It had been several years since we'd seen each other, and I had grown since then. No longer the skinny little twig of a barely-teen, I had grown into a...well...slender teen. Not everything was in complete proportion, and the delight of various girlfriends had given me more than enough confidence for my age. You might even say I was more than a little cocky at times.

I'd had a bad crush on you all those years ago, fantasizing about what I'd do to you if given half the chance. Of course it wasn't like it had ever gone away, you had. I'd found new spank-bank material, but any time I was reminded of you you would go right back to the top.

You had cemented my desire for older women, and I had never forgotten it. So when you moved back, needing a place for the summer until you had your own place I encouraged it. I already wasn't going on the yearly family trip due to an internship I'd landed, and while I didn't necessarily think anything was going to happen just the thought of your delicious female flesh so close for an extended time was thrilling. Enough so that I had to spend an hour draining my balls before picking you up from time airport so I would not have a massive tent.

With the parents gone, the house and you were all mine, and if there was any chance I wasn't going to waste it.

Hello everyone, thank you for reading. I was envisioning more of a dubcon scenario with my character being the sexual aggressor.

I left a lot of details out, such as age of the aunt, marital status, and even personality. Make her your own so I can do the same.

I tend towards the more...intense scenarios and kinks and submissive partners, so please let me know what you are comfortable with.

I look forward to the conquest."
9434xm,6,2018-08-02,Does anyone here just...not much have interest in a career and just want a job?,Juice_Campbell,CasualConversation,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/9434xm/does_anyone_here_justnot_much_have_interest_in_a/,"I've been working since I was 18 years old and I worked through college and beyond. I graduated with a political science degree and I've held a number of jobs since graduating: project manager, legal assistant, logistics clerk, and currently: social worker, which is what I wanted to do after I did an internship with a nonprofit. 

Here's the thing. I went through college really wanting to have a huge and impressive career. I majored in education wanting to be a teacher, psychology wanting to be a therapist, and then settled on political science because I wanted to be a lawyer. But once I got out of college, I was so burnt out and just wanted to make a living, which is when I started working at a call center making pretty good money, then had various career changes over the years.

Since then, I've had the chance to work on myself and do the things that I want, NOT the things that are expected of me. At my current job I'm at the bottom of the ladder but I don't know if I want to climb the ladder. I make a living wage as a social worker for the state. I'm just a worker and I can ask my boss as many questions as I want. I'm allowed to be confused as long as I seek guidance to get rid of my confusion. And I love that. I can devote myself to my clients and enriching my inner/personal lives.

Here's the thing. People are jumping down my throat asking me what my next step is going to be. I'm lukewarm about going to grad school even though my job will pay for it, because if I get a master's degree, I'll get a job with more stress, more responsibility, be in charge of other workers...I understand if that's your thing, but man, it's not mine. I enjoy my job and all but I enjoy my day more AFTER I clock out.

If I lost my state job, I would re-apply to the call center I used to work at because of how steady and reliable it was. And I'd probably stay there for quite a while, too, since I enjoyed working there.

I didn't feel this way until I moved out of my parents' house two years ago and started paying bills and taking care of myself. I've been living with my long-term girlfriend who also works (even though she's extremely career oriented and I'm not) and I've been doing great. I could afford to live alone, but I don't. I take care of myself. My father is an engineer and makes 5x what I do, and he's even put a little pressure on me asking what my future plans are...

Does anyone else kinda feel the same?"

My name is Mike and I am a MIS major going into my sophomore year in college. This summer I have tried to increase my programming knowledge and skills as well as grow my portfolio with coding projects for my future career and internships during and post college. I decided to create an updating cryptocurrency website that shows a few pieces of information for Bitcoin(price, market cap, 24 change and volume) a few weeks ago. This is my first project after learning html, css and javascript.

Link: [http://coinlive.me](http://coinlive.me)

https://i.redd.it/oh10euugxqd11.png

I added the real time information and a logo effect so the website can be just left on a computer screen to display the updating price data.  I know that the site could definitely use more work but honestly I am pretty proud of how it turned out so far. Some of the current problems are that the website is not very mobile friendly, some of the elements overlap and the logo animation effect does not work with a finger touch on mobile either. This is unfortunate but I am aware of these problems and am still trying my best to make it better as much as I can!

Some future ideas I have are to add more cryptocurrencies and add more data and potentially graphs.

I am very open to constructive criticism of what I should change and what I can make better.

Thanks for reading and checking out my site! I hope this can be of use to someone!

These probably won't be fully worked out but feel free to interpret them your own way:


(Note: I would be very interested in replies saying why you aren't interested; always looking to improve.)


____________________________________________________________________


**For F:**


This just a bit of a general overview. As well as all of the ideas below I'm also completely up for any sort of clichéd older female/younger male rp where you're the one in charge (teachers, friend's mums etc) ;)
My main kinks are: big cocks, you being in charge, lots of cum, handjobs/fingering, oral/cunnilingus, sex, anal, public (really feeling this today).


_______________________________________________________________


**For F** (Maybe M?):


I don't know if it is the good weather or what but I have been into public/outdoor/exhibitionist/voyeur stuff recently. Whether that be a secluded cove on a beach with boats going by, a clearing in the woods with an inviting pool, or a hotel with windows that can be seen for elsewhere let's show off just how hot we are. I'm also up for a nudist type rp.
No real plan here so hit me with what you got.
(Guys maybe a Nudist roommate?)


_______________________________________________________________


**For F:**


I sit with the rest of the lots waiting to be put up for auction in a small room behind the stage. Gradually the room emptied as, one by one, each of us was summoned to be taken out in front of the crowd of wealthy potential owners. Through the door we heard the gasps and applause get louder with the improving quality of each lot and buzz of excitement and anticipation growing.
Eventually I was left alone, and naked, waiting to be brought in front of the expectant crowd...
Quite why I am up for sale is up for discussion but once you buy me I have to do what you tell me to.


_____________________________________________________________


**For F:**


I like the idea of being tied to a chair and blindfolded while a woman has her way with me. I'm not talking about heavy BDSM but more being teased and used and giving up some control. When I think about this I'm usually naked but I can be clothed if you prefer.
For instance you might be my girlfriend adding a kinky new side to our relationship, you might be her friend who wants to fuck me instead, maybe you are my boss and you decide you want to use the new intern or maybe I don't even know who is doing this too me.
Let's talk and see what we come up with.


____________________________________________________________


**For F:**


This can start a few different ways.  I will outline a few but feel free to jump in with anything around this theme. The exact setting is up for discussion; I have written it like it is ancient Rome/Greece but it could easily be Egypt, the Aztecs, the Inca or a more modern cult setting.
I live in the temple of the God of fertility. I have been specially chosen by the priestesses to be part of the ritual for worship. To bring peace and fertility to the city the priestesses must make ""sacrifices"" the most common of these is that they must cum on the alter and to do so they use me. I have been blessed with a huge cock and an ability to stay hard for as long as needed and cum over and over again, perfect for busy program of worshipping that happens each day.
Powerful women also come to the temple looking to worship and give their offering to the Gods. It is my duty to help them reach the heightened state of consciousness needed to do so. It is also said that my cum has special properties and women will come to receive a blessing from me (and publicly so all can see how pious they are).
Some even see me as a physical embodiment of a God or demi-God myself; to be worshipped and pleased in my own right. Or you could, of course, play the Goddess herself come down to Earth to fulfil some prophecy or accept a sacrifice.
Again this very up for discussion and there are many different ways this could be taken with me playing either a submissive (preferred) or dominant role.


_____________________________________________________________


**For F:**


A few rule 34 worlds to play in: Harry Potter, Big Bang Theory, GoT, others. I have a few specific ideas but feel free to suggest some.


___________________________________________________________


**For M:**


I'm particularly looking for straight guys who can't help themselves around huge cock. I'm going to send you a message that could be a reply to your dirtyr4r post or some comment that you have made.
Here are the things I am into:
Having a huge cock, having it worshipped, having someone to stroke my cock and suck on it, taking things slow, hearing how my cock makes you feel and what you think of it.
You don't have to be small your self (I like domming big guys) but you do have to know your place.

9440zp,48,2018-08-02,Tokoyami internship foreshadowing?,DoraMuda,BokuNoHeroAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/9440zp/tokoyami_internship_foreshadowing/,"Holy shit, I think Horikoshi actually foreshadowed Tokoyami's internship under Hawks all the way back near the beginning of the Sports Festival arc!

OK, so in chapter 46, when the Class A kids are at the train station about to go off to their internships, Kirishima says to Tokoyami, *""You headed to Kyushu? It's the other way?""*: http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OuIZrYxV_y0/WKP68nhZA8I/AAAAAAAAqj4/x80AkohzwzocBOUi1na-MVbElXsle7sIQCHM/s16000/0046-010.png

And where does Hawks operate? That's right; Fukuoka, in Kyushu: https://twitter.com/CDCubed/status/1003687346880040960

Now I'm wondering if Tokoyami returned to Hawks for the more active internship he did post-Provisional License Exam arc (while Deku went to Sir Nighteye; Uraraka and Asui went to Ryukyu; and Kirishima went to Fat Gum).

**EDIT:** OK, apparently on the Twitter thread I linked above, someone already pointed this out, but it's a rare piece of super-early foreshadowing that I'm surprised no-one ever seemed to mention *here* (at least, to my knowledge).

Also, I'm probably stating the obvious here, but it might be worth mentioning that, despite their similarly birdlike appearances, Hawks may've not had any particular reason for offering Tokoyami his draft pick other than that he finished at third place (during which Hawks, coincidentally enough, would've still been the #3 Hero). He jokingly tells Endeavour that he would've liked the status of ""having the #2 Hero's son under your wing"", but of course, we know that Todoroki went to Endeavour's agency while the runner-up, Bakugou (although Hawks may've disapproved of his personality or just not wanted to deal with him, especially given how contrasting his carefree, easygoing personality would be), went to Best Jeanist's, and Iida went to Manual's (whose agency was in Hosu; the last place Stain, who attacked his older brother Ingenium there, had struck)."

I moved from Philadelphia to LA in May for an internship and am working on finding work out here. It’s going fine so far but I miss my city/home so much. I moved in with my boyfriend when I came out here and we love each other a lot so that part is great, but the homesickness is still hard to deal with, especially because there’s a good chance that I’ll live out here for a long time since I want to work out here, so I can’t really just move back home any time soon. All my friends and family are in Philly and it makes me really sad that from now on I’ll rarely get to see them in person. And this city is different from home in a lot of ways and it makes me feel out of place being here, like I belong on the east coast with the people I know. 

I’m kind of venting here but if anyone can offer advice or their own experiences with moving to a new place I would like to hear it. Thanks fellow gays. "
9446iu,1,2018-08-02,My parents are plotting to kidnap me,savvyapple,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/9446iu/my_parents_are_plotting_to_kidnap_me/,"Alright the title may exaggerate the reality but this is honestly how I feel. Here's the thing : I'm scheduled to have my wisdom teeth removed in 2 months. I told my parents (my mom is the narc while my father is the enabler) because I asked them some cash to pay the dentist for the consultation so I had to tell them. Right after my mom harassed me on the phone so that I accept to travel from my home to theirs (we're living in different cities) to stay with them during my 2 weeks of sick leave. I refused every time she tried to convince me.

Now my big sister called me to inform me that my mom called her and revealed to her her big plans : she's planning on showing up during my sick leave and take me to their home because ""it's a grave surgery and I can't be on my own and the reason I said no was because I was ashamed to ask them for help"".

I'm angry and scared because of this shit she's trying to do behind my back and without my consent. I have been trying to reduce contact with her since the last time I stayed at her home. I spent 3 weeks in between my internships there and it turned into hell. Both my parents acted nice to me during the first days and then my mom started to berate me and try to control everything I did as per usual. My last weekend there ended in a mess as I spent 1 hour crying of rage because I was emotionally tired of her bullshit (she legit went batshit crazy on me because I made a mistake when I did the laundry and called me stupid, ditzy, incompetent, I yelled back at her and later I was told by both my parents I should apologize and I refused to do so because she's the one who overreacted and I was defending myself against the injustice of the situation). And of course my enabler father sided with her and said I was the problem. Anyway just thinking of staying with them more than 48 hours and in a vulnerable state makes me anxious. 

I just needed to share this because I feel like my narc mom's behavior is escalating to new heights now that I'm slated to graduate in 2 years and she's now doing the most to control me and impose her whims on me while she still can. I don't know how I'll handle this. "

I'm not concerned about the budget, it fits in about perfectly with what I can expend. I'm looking more for any potential conflicts or issues which may occur with this build. PCPartpicker claims there are none, but I figured it wouldn't hurt much to double check. Additionally, any alternate parts which offer better functionality/quality for similar prices would be welcome recommendations. Thanks in advance!"
944hhj,5,2018-08-02,Aoutem (Part 3),olecranon_D,u_olecranon_D,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_olecranon_D/comments/944hhj/aoutem_part_3/,"NSFW  SERIES

When I finally reached Ironton I didn’t go to the Motel, but drove straight out to the forest and parked.  Then I loaded up my equipment and took the long hike out to the campsite using my GPS to help me find my way.  The smells, the sounds, the damp feel of the woods, all reminded me so much of the first time I was there.  It was like smelling a perfume in a crowd of people and immediately remembering an old girlfriend and having old memories of her flood back into your mind again.

When I arrived at the campsite I could see where Mike had set up his tent and equipment.  He wasn’t there, so I set up my tent and then went to find him.  I went to the nearby site where the fairy ring had been, and to my surprise the ring was already there.  The mushrooms were already up and full grown.  I was a little panicked that we had missed everything.  I looked around for signs of Mike and saw that a video camera with a tripod was laying knocked over in the leaves.  I set it back up and found that it had at least 20 minutes of video recorded on it.  I immediately started replaying the recording.

Mike had set the camera to low light mode.  On the video it was nighttime and I could hear crickets in the background.  Mike was laying out a blanket within the fairy ring.  He laid down on the blanket and was looking up into the tree canopy waiting.  I fast forwarded a few minutes and saw as he had closed his eyes possibly falling asleep.  He started scratching a little and seemed restless.  Then he sat up quickly as if he had heard something nearby and looked directly at the camera.  That really creeped me out.  It was like he just noticed I was there and was looking at me.  I even looked up from the camera for a second to make sure he wasn’t actually sitting there looking at me.

As Mike sat there looking towards the camera there were no sounds on the tape, even the crickets had gone silent.  Then there was a snapping sound like someone stepping on a stick.  Mike continued to stare at the camera.  Then started smiling, which felt even creepier.  Then the wind began to pick up and the crickets started again.  The noise of the wind and crickets slowly increased like in the horror movies where the music builds just before the monster jumps out.  No sooner had I thought that, when the video camera tipped over and fell into the leaves and the view of Mike was gone.  In the audio, I heard him laugh softly and I could hear his footsteps moving off into the woods. Nothing else was on the tape.

I yelled a few times for Mike, but didn’t get a response, so I started walking into the woods in the direction Mike would have been staring in the video.  I had walked for about ten minutes calling for him when I found his shirt hanging from a tree limb.  At least I knew I was headed in the right direction.  Now I was thinking that he may have gone through the hallucinogenic experience and was laying naked and exhausted somewhere in the woods too tired to walk back to camp.

Knowing what I might be walking up upon, I collected his shirt to cover him once I found him.  It wasn’t much longer and I found his shoes and socks tossed randomly into the underbrush.  Then, as I expected, I found his pants and underwear a little further on.  I made sure I collected everything not wanting to see more of Mike than I had to.

The foliage was getting a little thicker, but I was able to follow his trail by a few broken twigs and bent over plants he created walking through the woods.  Then coming through a cluster of small trees I emerged into an opening.  There was a large tree trunk on the ground from a tree that had fallen due to a storm or something.  Here the direct sunlight was able to penetrate all the way to the forest floor and many plants had sprung up in the oasis of sunlight.  In the center of the plants though was an area were all the plants had been knocked down.  Mike was in the center of it with a beam of sunlight streaming down on his body like a spot light.

Instead of the rash that we both got the first time, his body was splotchy almost bruised looking from dark spots on his skin.  Getting closer I called out his name but he didn’t respond.  His eyes were wide open but filmy.  His mouth was opening and closing like a fish on land gasping for air.  I went to shake him, but then I noticed that the blotches werent bruises, but a fuzzy kind of coating like what you might see on bread.  It looked like mold, but much darker in color.  I tried to wipe some of it off with his shirt and it left a dark soot-like spot on the fabric.  Under his skin it looked like a web, or like roots, which I then realized were fungal hyphae.  The hyphae were spreading through his skin, and the dark spot I had wiped off was like black bread mold producing fruiting bodies on the surface of his skin releasing dark soot-like spores.  It was frightening and disgusting.  Mike’s body had become covered with mass of spore producing fungal bodies.

I shook Mike again using his shirt.  I didn’t want to touch his moldy skin.  He continued to gasp and didn’t respond.  I didn’t know how I would do it, but I had to get him to the car and to the hospital.  I pulled him up into a sitting position and as I did it, there was a sound similar to  velcro being pulled apart.  The hyphae had not only had spread through his skin, but had penetrated from his skin into the ground everywhere his body made contact with the forest floor. His entire back was covered with small rootlike projections that had torn like velcro as I sat him up.  I notice then that his hands and feet were also laced together with hyphae like webs between his fingers and toes.

I rolled him up onto my shoulders as I had learned in a first aid class and I carried him to my car.  The terrain was rough and he was heavy, so it took me awhile.  I had to stop several times to catch my breath before I reached the car.  By the time we reached the nearest hospital it was late afternoon.  I tried to explain everything to the doctors, but they seemed less concerned about what was happening and more concerned about stopping the massive fungal infection spreading through Mike’s body.  They took him to the ICU and put him in one of those infectious disease tents.  Knowing that I had been exposed they made me go into an ICU tent also.

Nurses and doctors gloved and gowned with an infectious disease uniforms stripped me and washed me down with some sort of antifungal solution.  I told the ICU nurse to strap me down to the table.  I was afraid that I would get up in the night and wander out into the forest.  She thought I was crazy, but sent in a young doctor to talk to me.  It took a while, but I was finally able to convince him to strap me down.  I told him that the fungus we were dealing with could cause hallucinations and that I may try to get up and sleep walk at night.  I don’t think he believed me, but it didn’t affect him any to do as I requested.

The staff then started intravenously pumping antifungal IV’s into my body.  The intern explained that antifungals did not work well for internal infections.  Human cells and fungal cells were very similar and that we were more closely related to fungi than bacteria.  Fungicides would kill the fungal infection, but could also damage and kill human cells if they weren’t careful.  That’s why it can be so hard to get rid of fungal infections like athletes foot, yeast infections, and lung infections.

That night when the lights were low and everything was quiet except the soft beeping of the  medical equipment, my Aoutem came to me.  I heard her calling to me from the end of the hallway. I struggled to get up, then remembered I was strapped down.

Straining against the straps I turned to get a better look down the dimly lit hall.  Her voice was just a whisper from the shadows, but seemed to be getting closer.  Finally, it sounded like she was so close, like she was right outside my ICU tent.  I twisted my head as far as I could and made out her darkened form just a few feet from me.  She was standing over me, just outside the tent.  My eyes followed her curves as I strained against the restraints to reach out and touch her.  I craved to touch her, kiss her, hold her again.

I know I wasn’t thinking right.  I know that she couldn’t be standing there, but I would have done anything to get out of the tent and follow her, IV’s and all.  I can still see her as she reached towards me and the flaps of the tent parted.  She had an enticing gleam in her eye as she leaned over me.  Her hand brushed my thigh as I felt the faintest touch move up under my gown.   Her other hand clasped mine and she pulled me towards her.  Slowly she turned and waved for me to follow her and then she passed through the flaps of the tent.

I felt like I was going insane.  I slammed and strained against the straps trying to break them, or break the rails of my bed, to do anything to tear free and follow her.  My monitor must have gone off because the ICU nurse came rushing into my tent completely gowned up.  She injected something into my arm and then other staff came rushing in.  I don’t remember much from that point on.  I was told I was screaming hysterically and thrashing against the restraints.  They gave me something to relax me and that is when I passed out.  The next morning I could see I had bruises on my wrists and ankles from my violent struggle.  For my safety they even added strap around my chest.

The antifungals must have worked because I only developed had a few spotty darkened areas of mold on my skin.  I later saw I had a few ragged hyphae along my back and legs where the fungus had tried to grow out of my body and into the sheets and mattress below me trying to seek out forest soil to colonize.  Without soil nutrients and with the strong antifungal drugs in my body the hyphae began to break down and die.

What hurt the most was that they also told me that Mike had died during the night.  I later learned that the autopsy showed that his lungs were filled with hyphae.  Even more terrifying was that the hyphae had worked its way into his brain.  They noted that the cause of death was a combination of fungal meningitis and pneumonia caused by his infected lungs and brain.  The Doctors think that was also what had caused our hallucinations.

The CAT scans they took of me showed that hyphae was also in my lungs, but not as invasive as Mike’s.  There were also a few fuzzy patches in my brain that they thought was probably the fungus too.

Each night for about a week my Aoutem came to me.  But each experience was a little weaker, a little fuzzier, until eventually the hallucinations stopped.  I still feel addicted and have the urge to go back into the woods, but I have not had any further hallucinations.  Follow up CAT scans show that I am free of the fungal hyphae.  The doctors say that since I am completely clear of the fungus that any urges I still have are probably due to the craving for neurotransmitter spikes stimulated by the fungus.  This would be similar to the side effects you get from opiates or LSD (which by the way was originally discovered in fungi).  The only side effect besides the cravings, was liver damage due to the strong antifungal chemicals the gave me.  Fortunately the liver is good at repairing itself and my liver function has improved.

Since Mike’s death I have gone ahead and written up our findings.  As an honor to Mike, I named the new species of fungus in memory of him.  I know that some of you may be tempted to follow my work and try to find the specific fungus so I won’t name it here.  It may sound like a wonderful experience which I must say it was, except for the death part.  I’m not giving you the name of the fungus to make it harder find any images of what it looks like, or where is is found.

It does appear that there are two fungal phases.  The first phase is the infection phase that occurs when the hyphae and spores in the soil infect the host and cause the original hallucinations.  About a year later the second phase occurs where the infected host, due to hallucinations, seeks out a wooded area.  As the host dies, the host’s decaying body inoculates the soil spreading the fungus to new areas.  There is a fungus that does something similar to ants.  Once an ant is infected it will climb to a high point on a plant or building and then the fungus will emerge from the ant’s body.  Then the wind spreads the spores to a new location.  Humans in theory could take the fungus anywhere in the world during their travels and spread it to new territories and infect more people.  I wonder if that is what the Aoutmoin/medicine man had planned for Father Portier, that he would go back to his people and infect them.  Was this an early form of biowarfare against the French?

I wish I could say the story ends there, but about a year later, in honor of Mike, I went back to the hospital to thank the doctors for saving my life and trying to save his.  I still have some nightmares about what happened, but I’m told that those may just be from the trauma of everything that happened and not from the fungus.  Talking with the doctors I finally had a chance to tell them the whole story.  I think I just needed to talk about it.  I explained what our research eventually determined about the fungus as far as how it infected and spread, although in not as much detail as I told you.  I also explained that their work to save me should be used as a standard procedure for saving anyone else that might be infected. We even talked about publishing the case and procedures in medical journals together.

I visited for a couple of hours, but when it was time to leave one of the doctors pulled me aside.  She told me that one of the ER nurses that first met us when we arrived, had what might be a similar experience.  Within a few days of Mike and I being admitted to the hospital, the nurse was also found lying naked in a side yard of the apartment of one of her neighbor’s.  The nurse appeared to be high on something.  There was an investigation and the nurse was fired because of suspected of drug use.  Some even suspected her of stealing opiates from patients.  The Doctor explained that recently she heard the nurse had disappeared.  One evening she just left her apartment with the door wide open and didn’t come back.  Rumor around the hospital was that she may have been selling drugs to a local drug gang and when she couldn’t supply them anymore they killed her.  Some thought it was more likely that she was an addict herself and was now living on the streets trying to beg, or sell herself for another fix.

The entire conversation worried me. I had a feeling that this could be more than a drug addiction. Was it possible that somehow Mike, or I, had infected the nurse when we arrived at the hospital?  I went back to the motel and couldn’t get the story of the missing nurse out of my mind.

Confused about what's the smartest decision for my current situation.",FeelingPrettyLost1,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9450jg/48k_in_savings_living_in_a_college_dorm_working_a/,"Hey everybody! It's been a while since I posted. I have posted last November that my last parent has passed away and I have since become an independent with no other family left. Currently, I am a 20-year-old student pursuing a degree in computer science. I work at my college right now doing basically house cleaning for $8.60 per hour. I live in my dorm as I don't have any other places to live at and my college is currently only providing free housing for the summer. I don't know if continuing college is the greatest idea for me. I am supposed to be a junior this upcoming year, but I am a bit behind so I am considered a sophomore credit wise. I don't have an accurate estimate when I will graduate, I expect around 2020 fall or 2021 spring. As it is around $25,000 per year. I get about $6000 in Pell grants, $1000 in SEOG grants, $4400 in sub loans, $2000 in unsub loans, and $11,000 in NJ TAG Grants. That's how I have previously paid for my tuition. I was wondering if I should purchase a motorcycle during the summer as a means of transportation and expanding potential jobs or internships for next year. A car is way too expensive for me as insurance rates in NJ are really high and also gas is expensive. But I save money on both if I get a motorcycle. Should I just try to find an entry-level position for programming instead of pursuing my degree? I am very conflicted and I just need some proper and smart guidance from the adults."
9457pu,13,2018-08-02,Masters Program Admission,anotherProgrammerGuy,UCSC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSC/comments/9457pu/masters_program_admission/,"Hi, I'm a recent undergrad from here, got my Bachelors in CS. I didn't know what the best path was for me in my junior year, I thought I was just going to work right out of college. Now having had a lot more time to plan for the future I've decided that I should try to get into a Masters Computer Science program sooner than later in life. I graduated with a GPA of 3.36 at Santa Cruz, I had a GPA of 3.45 at community college. I'm planning on taking the GRE in August. I'm also planning on taking on a few internships before I would return to school.

I've been reading a lot about grad school and admissions lately. Half of what I read is reassuring the other having is dismaying. I'm looking for some clarification on a few things:

1) When they look at my application will they calculate my GPA looking at all my grades from both colleges?

2) I've read a lot about what a competitive profile for Grad School looks like. I see a lot of closer to 3.5 and up is what they're looking for, but I've also seen posts that say they got into a UC with a 3.2. Does the GPA that I've stated seem like I have a chance?

3) I've read that it matters where you got your undergraduate degree from. Since I got my degree here does that increase my chances at getting into a Masters program here and at other UCs?

4) I've thought a lot about what I want to study, why I want to study it, and what I will do with my life after I get a degree. How much does the statement of purpose weigh in the decision making process?

5) Some colleges have admission statistics on their websites at the office of institutional research. I haven't been able to find anything about admitted GPAs or GRE scores for graduate students, only about number of students admitted to various programs. Are there any such statistics out there?

I know there are a lot of posts out there like this so I'm sorry to add mine to the list. I appreciate any input, thank you."

Just started a new job a few days ago in structural engineering (bridge engineering, in fact, lol). 

One serious problem though is that I kind of screwed myself by doing a very un-beneficial graduate program at a private university rather than a state school. It was an accelerated program, meaning I finished it in two semesters, but at great personal expense. It is a very competitive school (top 20 nationally), but their CEE program is, as I discovered while attending, rather weak. There were only a handful of courses offered in structures, and they were very flexible with their degree requirements to compensate for this. Long story short, I only took an FEM class, a concrete and steel class, which had a lot of overlap with the ones I took in undergrad, and a structural dynamics class (I took a few other tangentially related non-major classes). One of the reasons I selected this school is because of family legacy (family really of wanted me to go, and I wasn't admitted as an undergrad), and as such I was able to graduate with financial assistance from them. However, as I am discovering, I did not learn very much. I know everyone says that working is totally different from school and that the first few weeks can be tough (and I discovered this in my internships), but I feel like this is completely on another level.

I applied for a lot of jobs and got a few interviews, and by my luck, I got a job in a bridge engineering office (my boss seemed interested in my MATLAB/Excel/programming skills, interestingly the technical questions were somewhat limited). However, as of now, I have no experience with prestressed concrete, seismic design, or bridge engineering, not to mention anything related to AASHTO. I've been in for about a week now and I'm utterly lost, and I'm kind of too embarrassed to say anything. I relocated for this position so I'm very worried about my well-being. 

I would just like some advice from people who have gone this route and who may have some suggestions for me. "

I've never been to California, or lived in a big city where I had to cover my own expenses, so obviously this was a huge wake-up call. I've modified my criteria to fit some more, realistic ambitions.*

Hello again!

First off, big thank you to everyone who helped me out with my last post. Your comments and feedback were extremely helpful. So the good news is that I got the internship! The bad part is living in SF is stupidly expensive so I need some help.

My internship is located at the airport so traveling to work without a car is definitely doable with public transit and maybe an electric scooter/bike. My employer is also paying me fairly well, though the high cost of living in SF might just bite me in the wallet eventually.

Does anyone have recommendations on places that fit the following criteria?

* Rent at or below $1,600 including utilities
* Single room/no roommates (not a studio)
* Easy access to public transit
* Kitchen, bathroom, washing machine, etc.
* Close to the airport (if it's cheaper)

I'm willing to compromise on a few things, but I just wanted to know what's out there before I have to start compromising. My employer sent me information about some housing options, but they're slightly more than what I would like to pay. Additionally, I might have to pay rent for my other apartment in Daytona Beach, FL (where I go to school) since I might not be able to find someone to sublease under me."

I am def being fucked right in the ass by these people.

I am learning jack shit here, nothing, rien, nada. There IS someone that could teach me something but this freelance dev just doesn't give shit, any questions I have are just met by the same answer ""Go google it"", hey asshole, listen up, if I am asking you it's because I have been googling for a while already, doesn't help that you have imposed a hipster ass framework with a very small documentation compared to other ones, so don't just tell me to google shit, then you and my boss are asking yourselves ""hey, why isn't the project advancing?????"".

I am stuck in this hellhole for atleast 3 more months, 3 long months, as I must do 6 months in the same internship to be able to finally graduate. There is not one day where I am not feeling stressed out, every single day I am more stressed out than the last, I cannot seem to be able to unwind even on weekends, as I am dreading looking at my emails on monday morning, waiting for the inevitable callout.

I want to get off this wild ride."

94a1gq,3,2018-08-03,Jaw problems and more,wildpantz,HealthAnxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/94a1gq/jaw_problems_and_more/,"Hi guys. This may be a little long so sorry in advance if it gets boring. Skip after the hashtag if not interested.  


I'm literally feeling like my body is falling apart. I guess I could say I have more or less problems with my stomach (gastritis I suppose considering ultrasound was good), teeth, eyes, and jaw joint. And the last one is really becoming a pain in the ass.  


Next to my classic HA, I have a fear of doctors, or fear of getting an operation to be exact, so I have a ""I'd rather not find out"" mentality with diseases, therefore I'm really scared of getting something I'll have to attend doctor's office for. I know I need to change this way of thinking, but I don't seem to have a good way of getting past that. Stay with me please, because this part is at least a little connected to where I'm going. Basically, I suffered over a year from stomach pains before I went to the doctors, the only reason being the pain became just too damn annoying. I guess it's stress related because it gets noticeably worse over time, so I'm learning to manage it.   


\###  


Now to the main part of the story.   


I got two wisdom teeth out recently (impacted, also about 10 years late). One was one 11th of September last year and the other on third of January of this year. I've managed to recover within three months for each tooth and recently, as I was eating a hard-to-chew piece of meat I heard some clicking noise in my right part of jaw. After a few days I noticed when I would close my mouth completely, the muscle would hurt. I could even locate the exact part (upper part of cheekbone, the part that kind of stands out when you feel it) that hurt and you can actually feel something like a fat blood vessel or more likely that thing that connects muscles (sorry not native english speaker).  


At times it was worse, I could literally feel my jaw shifting forward, at least according to the placement of the teeth. When I go to sleep and wake up, this effect is almost gone and I can only feel a little pain, but as the day goes by and I have a couple of meals it's back.  


Of course, I googled, and I suppose it's TMJ. I could live with this pain I guess, I found some exercises online and they kind of work. Also, at one time it passed for a few days until I found another stubborn piece of food to chew at.  


Now I noticed when my teeth click, or I knock almost anywhere on my head, I can hear a dull sound in my right inner ear and this is scaring the living shit out of me. I'm afraid to google what this means honestly and I've had multiple ""it's a tumor scare episodes"", but I'm also afraid to get checked out, going for x ray for maybe no reason, or the pain I'm gonna experience when they set my jaw straight (don't really want to picture how that works, but I have a few nervous guesses)

Btw, my teeth surgeon was really stupid, I was appointed to him and was very afraid (because his reputation was pretty shitty on the internet) but one of his interns thankfully did the procedure and he did a pretty good job. When I was back to get my stitches out, the surgeon said he'll show me some exercises I need to do and afterwards made it such a painful process getting the stitches out that I forgot to ask him for the instructions and he didn't seem to remember either. (this always happens to me, my heart rate triples and I can't think straight, I miss everything they tell me, just because I always think when it's going to end)  


My question is, if you ever experienced this, have you found a good way to relax that muscle? Could it perhaps go away if I ate only squishy food for a few days to let it relax?  


Thanks and sorry for the huge post."

I'm currently a ChemE major, CS minor at a decent state school for engineering.  I'm looking for CS Master's programs to do and UPenn's MCIT program is attractive because it's cheap, online, and a world class education.  My goal is to work at a top tech company and this program seems to have decent placement at those companies.  

The only issue is that I feel like this program might not be rigorous enough and/or repeating classes I already took.  I have one internship in software engineering (currently working in Philly) as well.

  
The classes I will have taken by the time I graduate are 

* Intro to Java (2 classes)
* C Programming
* Discrete Math
* Data Structures
* Operating Systems
* Assembly

Do I have too much of a background in CS to get much out of the MCIT program?"
94aozy,1,2018-08-03,Back after 3 weeks aka when mental illness and chronic pain strike,comfortablynummb,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/94aozy/back_after_3_weeks_aka_when_mental_illness_and/,"It's been a wild ride. (**long post ahead)**

I arrived to the meeting place completely exhausted and stressed out thanks to everything that's been going on in the last 1.5 months. I was pretty much burned-out when I fell into his arms, and my mood was super low. He, on the other hand, was tired from working those early shifts. So it didn't start as good as it had at other times, we hardly talked that first evening, nor were we intimate (idk about you guys, but usually we get intimate as soon as we can after reuniting). All this + our communication issues in the 2 weeks before the visit put me in a very weird mental state, a la type ""is this worth it? are we okay? what is happening?"". I completely failed to communicate my worries (or ideas of worries, for that reason) to my partner the day after I flew over, and the fight that followed did little to reassure me. 

During the next weeks, the situation got a bit better, I slowly started gaining more control over my paranoia (""if we talk less now that we're together everyday, does this mean we're growing apart/getting bored of one another/ have nothing more to tell each other""), but I was still nervous over small things so we had a couple smaller fights. I also had one major breakdown thanks to my deteriorating mental state, and I have to hand it to my bf, he really tried his best to let me know he's there for me and cares for me. (Especially since I got so bad that at one point I was crying telling him he should break up with me and find someone locally, someone who's mentally healthy and speaks his language...). My lurking depression decided to strike again, and as I have an important exam coming up in a week, a very large part of my energy went only into assuring I can study each day.

My bf's been having a hard time himself, the early shifts in combination with his chronic pain have been very tiring on him, and I tried my best to do things that could help ease his everyday life (like preparing his coffee for the morning, doing the dishes so he didn't have to come home from piles of dishes at work to even more piles of dishes, massaging his neck and back etc.). Besides, lest forget the summer heat, his appartment was like a sauna. Put together, neither of us had much energy to do stuff, so most the time was spent watching and listening to stuff and playing quiz games online. There were also only a couple of times during the whole visit when we slept together, at first it made me insecure but as we were otherwise intimate with eachother (random kisses, hand holding, random parts of bodies touching while we were sitting together, cuddling in bed etc.), I'm blaming it on our seraparate mental states and tiredness. 

Today I woke up by myself again instead of having him tap me awake to kiss me goodbye before leaving for work and as you can imagine, it felt very weird. We are meeting in one of my favourite cities in a week though, and then I'm finally introducing him to my family (&amp;hopefully friends) and showing him parts of the country where I grew up. As my mental state is still shiet, I am worried I'll fall back into obssessing over our communication in the meanwhile, but hopefully studying and revising will keep me occupied enough. I'd love to have some friends here that I could grab an evening coffee/ice cream with after studying, but alas they are all abroad already working on their internships, so all I can do is try to keep myself occupied in other ways and develop plans for making new friends in autumn.

I don't believe this post has a point, I just wanted to write a summary of the visit. Thanks to the breakdown I experienced and the thoughts it put into my head, I decided to talk with my mom about my mental illness and she agreed to support me in seeking help for it. I refuse to let the insecurities I gained thanks to family life control me or make me destroy this relationship. Despite the doubts my mental illnesses are putting into my head, my partner is so good to me. And I want to get so much better, so I can be good to him, too."

I’m looking for someone willing to play long term, and so many characters. As for me, I would like to play a young Taylor Swift or Dove Cameron. Recently 18 and coming off a smash hit album (or show). That first one was totally innocent but now, my manager (played by you) wants me to get little more risqué. Show some more skin, song some filthier songs. Maybe even get some body enhancements. 

Essentially this is a slow but steady bimbofication prompt that centers around a celeb (either Taylor or Dove). I might be open to trying another celeb but you’d have to convince me. 

Characters you’d likely play (this could expand or shrink based on how you wanna do this): my manager who’s pushing me into the bimbo world for his filthy reasons, other slutty artists I’m now forced to collaborate with, maybe the office intern who falls for me as I under go my transition or more!

My kinks are humiliation, facials, excessive cum, lactation, anything with my ass, queefing, bimbofication and so much more. Only limits are toilet, gore and animals.

I went to see someone and got this treated which led to us breaking up eventually. I became sensitive to "" netgativity and negative people"" I wanted to avoid them at any cost.

Then afterwards we're sitting around cuddling and she breaks down crying super hard. I put my arm around her and asked her what's going on. 

She says shes super stressed because her best friend just tried to commit suicide, her boyfriend is long distance, and she's having a hard time keeping it together because her internship has her working 55-60 hour weeks.

I'm unsure of how to handle this, so I go quiet for a few seconds and she immediately starts apologizing for her behavior.

I literally don't know what to do at this point. So I just said ""really sorry to hear that"" and kiss her on the forehead. 

We end up cuddling for another 10 minutes and then I got up and called an uber for her.

Hey people,

I‘m 19 years old, male and I live in Europe. I hope somebody can help me out with the mess I have currently going on. Prepare for a long story.

So.. 3 days ago I started my internship in a food store as a salesman, but it seems like the job doesn‘t suit me (at all). I just imagined the job differently and now the reality hit me. I don’t even know why I applied for this job anyway.. It’s super hard for me to talk to people and to stand a whole day long in a store. I’m extremely introverted and I can work better alone (e.g. pc work or even working from home).

At the first day I could already feel, that the atmosphere of the store, the job and my co-workers are nothing for my taste. For the first 3 months I got put in the worst (for me) department I can think of in this job and it‘s the fresh counter, where they sell fresh meat. It‘s super hard for me to do the work, which is required there. After just 3 days, I have to work like I‘m already working 10 years in the store, and the pressure is probably too much for me. I can‘t even sleep at night, because I‘m always thinking about the internship and how much I HATE it.

I’m insanely close to quitting, but there is a slight problem, which doesn’t make me want to quit. I don‘t want to disappoint my family, because this is the first real chance I took on any job and I’m already starting to give up already after just 3 days. I think I’m not even able to work a full 40-hour week, because I can’t deal with it mentally and or physically, since I’m a more weaker person than average people. I need more free time for me. I realized that my mental strength isn‘t that strong and that I always question myself when doing mistakes or bad life choices and the pressure from working really gets to my head really quickly.

I know people might say, the start is always the hardest in any job and that I’m able to bite myself through it, but I can’t see myself working in that store or job even. I‘m not even able to speak to someone about my problem, because I‘m scared, that I might disappoint someone or that the person doesn’t understand my problem and doesn’t take it seriously. Today I came home and my nose starting bleeding like hell, because I was super stressed out. I was even close to passing out. I had little signs of depression before my internship, but now it came back even harder. I can’t feel happiness after I started working there and I feel like it’s only going to get worse.

I don‘t even know what to do at this point.. If I quit, I don‘t have a job, disappointed my family and don‘t know what to do while I don‘t have anything in terms of school or work. No income, nothing. I‘m living with my sister and I have to pay her 100-150€ every month for ""rent"". I can get on welfare, until I found something what I want to do, but my parents definitely won‘t like that. 

This is ridiculous what I‘m saying right now and people might think, that I’m just overreacting, but at night I really have thoughts about suicide.. that I might not succeed in life, but I really am too scared of death and I know I will just harm my family/friends doing it. I don’t want to make my family sad because of me. I have never been that depressed/sad ever in my life. If somebody tells me to man up and be an adult.. I can‘t.

I‘m really thinking about quitting tomorrow without telling my family. I‘m legally allowed to quit the internship without any reason in the first 3 months of my internship, so theres nothing holding me back from quitting besides my family and because I would have no income. I know that my mother/father will hate me for it and they probably wont even understand this whole situation, that‘s why I‘m not talking to them about it. They‘ll just say, that I shouldn‘t be such a weak person and that I‘ll get through it.

I already see myself lying in bed this night, thinking about all this shit again and wont sleep until probably 5 or 6 am. I guess I need to go to a doctor or something, because there is clearly something wrong with me.

I know it‘s a really long story, but it‘s real and my hardest decision in life. I hope somebody reads through this and can give me some tips regarding my situation. I‘m so emotionless right now. I don‘t want to eat, drink, sleep, talk or do anything at the moment because my situation is dragging me lower and lower every hour.

(I‘m sorry if there are flaws in the text, english is not my first language.)

TL;DR: I started an internship 3 days ago, it‘s like hell for me and I‘m thinking about quitting and I feel down as never before in my life.

I'm a university student from Germany in my early 30s, and a few months into an amazing relationship with a Cambodian woman. We met while she was studying in Switzerland (she is now finished). She will spend the next year doing an internship in the US and we'll be leading a LDR through that time, with our relationship hopefully surviving.

We are however already trying to figure out what how we can move together after this one year and experience everyday life without marrying directly (if possible). As far as I know, she could stay here on a tourism visa, but that wouldn't allow her to work, which in turn would stop us from getting to know each other better in an everyday life setting. For various reasons, I am for the next years bound to my city, so I can't move to Cambodia with her (or anywhere else, where we could be together).

Do you have any suggestions on how to move forward? Is there anyone among you who went through a similar scenario?"

I’m (F/22) significant other is (M/22),cocainewhitebody,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/94ct7n/really_need_to_vent_possibly_need_advice_read/,"Stumbled upon this today just after my S.O. Broke some news to me that has made me quite upset. We’ve been friends for 4 years this month and will have been together for 3 of those years this month. Met in undergrad, he has 2 more years for his masters and I just graduated and will be moving 45 minutes away from him to start grad school this fall. In May he left the east coast for an internship in California(I’m in NY) and will be there until December, won’t be back to school/near me until January. I have visited him three times, (two 3 day stints and most recently for two weeks straight, paying my way each time and paying for my food etc while with him). I have been living at home this summer before I begin grad school to save up for my move, have been supporting myself and paying my way through school since the beginning of my freshman year of college and had to take time off of work each time I visited him which has made my budget pretty tight. We are now nearing the beginning of my semester when I won’t be able to take time off to see him (will be in a demanding PhD program) so our deal was that he would come visit me next. Each time I visited him I planned it out 2-3 months in advance, but he has yet to commit to a time to see me even though he keeps saying he wants to see me for our anniversary or my birthday this fall. He also gets all federal holidays off, is salaried so could put in extra hours on certain days if he wants to take a day off, and works in computer science and his company lets him work from home so he could work from my apartment if he visited me. Company also provides him housing, breakfast and lunch, and his parents support him financially for groceries or anything else he needs. Which is fantastic, but also means to me that it makes more sense financially and commitment wise for him to visit me than for me to miss class and work in my lab and pay to see him. He messaged me today with a screenshot of a text from his mom saying that she didn’t want him to take time away from his internship to come to the east coast so he will not be coming back until it is over in December. (He had just asked her if he could come home this month to visit her and that was her response). He doesn’t really go against his moms word, and as mentioned before I have been almost entirely supporting myself and don’t consult my mother on my decisions anymore and really haven’t since I was 16. (His mom is amazing and I love her not trying to come off as having issues with her) I’m just pretty frustrated and am avoiding blowing up because I feel like I’m putting more effort into the relationship than he is and he didn’t really say anything after he sent that other than the screenshot and guess I won’t be seeing you kinda deal which made me even more upset. I don’t really feel like he gets it, and is still asking that I come to see him despite me telling him that I can’t take time off again to see him and that it took a lot for me to come to see him the other times. I don’t want to end the relationship or start a fight by just reacting and make the situation worse. I know it’s not that bad compared to other people’s situations on here but I’m just upset rn and really needed to vent.

TLDR: boyfriend moved from east coast to west coast and now I don’t know when I’ll see him next so I’m sad. At work and can’t cry but want to cry"

First off, holy crap. I'm so glad this exists. My brother essentially thinks I'm insane for wanting to travel long-term with all of my health problems, but I only get one life so I don't want to let my health problems limit me. 

I'm diagnosed with EDS, Endometriosis, and a slew of other things. I am planning on moving to Vienna for about 10 months to live with my partner (he is a US citizen and only has an internship so I can't get on his insurance plan). I have been rejected by CignaGlobal as well as GeoBlue, and I was wondering if anyone has any advice for living abroad with chronic illness. I've already looked into buying private health insurance in Austria (there is a 6 month waiting period). I will have at travel insurance at minimum (details below), but they exclude preexisting conditions.

I also spoke with the Health Insurance Marketplace, I need to maintain minimum essential coverage if I'm gone for less than 330 days, so it looks like I will probably(?) keep my current insurance. They cover urgent/emergent care abroad, but I'd have 0 coverage for outpatient.

Does anyone have experience living abroad and managing chronic conditions? I've emailed the folks over at the insurance company Pro-trip world to find out if they meet my visa requirements. Do you have additional travel insurance, doctor/hospital recommendations, or advice on getting routine care (refills)? I'm considering hopping over to Hungary for continuation of care because they are a medical tourism destination and only a couple hours away. 

Thanks!

Please let me know if there is a better subreddit for this post, perhaps [r/relationships](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships).

So I just entered into a short-term lease (summer internship in a different city) and my roommate/the owner of this house, has a small dog. Very quiet, extremely friendly, A+ doggo. When I moved in a few days ago, I noticed there were a few training pads on the floor, so I assumed she was a puppy, but it has become apparent over the last 3 days that my roommate leaves the dog at home for the entire day. I worked the first two days I was in the house from 9 to 5 and just assumed that someone walked the dog during the day. Today was my day off from work, and to the best of my knowledge, and granted I haven't been in the house all day, no one has come home to let the dog out. I came home around 5 PM after being gone for 3 hours and the dog had peed on one of the training pads so I'm assuming that no one came home in the interlude to let her out. My roommate left for work at 9 AM so the dog has been alone for 8 hours at this point.

I've never owned a dog in my life, just generally a big fan of puppers, so I have no idea if this is acceptable behavior. My gut screams no as I have pet-sat my share of dogs in my life, and I was walking them/letting them out in the yard three times a day at least while their owners were gone.

Is this alarming? Should I call someone? I've only been here three days so I am jumping the gun in being concerned? Someone else suggested that I gush to my roommate about how much I love dogs and I how would love to walk her dog on my days off if she would let me. However, I work/travel 4-5 days out of the week, and my lease is very short term, so that seems like not a good solution in the long run.

TL;DR: My new temporary roommate/landlord's dog is left at home all day to use a training pad. Is this abusive behavior that should be reported or am I overreacting?"
94e6xd,1,2018-08-03,Planning on accepting a job offer that pays significantly less than what I make bartending. Advice?,sangmundfroid,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/94e6xd/planning_on_accepting_a_job_offer_that_pays/,"Posting this in multiple places to get advice from different perspectives. Throwaway account just in case.

I have been bartending at a high-end casual restaurant for the past 4 years. I'm in a pretty good spot there; I'm one of the head bartenders, have a mostly set schedule, and average about $32 per hour including my hourly wage + avg tips. I usually only work about 32 hours per week, so this comes out to about $1000/wk. 

I also recently completed an internship in Human Resources as the last requirement for my Bachelor's in Psychology. I plan on beginning a clinical psychology Master's program next year (almost exactly a year from now). Eventual goal is to work in the research sector of forensic psychology. 

I have been offered a full time job by my internship supervisor at $20/hr. In the area I live, this is an unheard of wage for the position I would be working. To begin my employment, my job title would be administrative assistant/hr admin, but she said she would eventually like to move me more towards the role of HR Generalist. This position includes some pretty competitive benefits, some of which I have never had before. I was told that I can choose the amount of hours I'd like to work per week, anywhere from 30-40 to be considered full time and possibly still work my other job. However, insurance doesn't kick in until 90 days from hire and I currently have insurance through my other position. If I were to keep bartending part-time, I would lose my insurance because you have to be considered a full-time employee (30+ hours per week) to have insurance through the company. 

For the most part, I enjoy bartending. I enjoy the job itself, getting to shoot the shit with people and get paid for it, and of course, the money. However, a few people in management/other coworkers are absolutely insufferable. A couple of my managers are literally anxiety inducing. Almost everyone I work with is younger than me, so it is sometimes difficult to answer to people above me that have no additional training and/or skillset beyond what I have. It is very challenging to deal with the lapse in maturity I have with most people there, as well as experience the terrible work ethic of the majority of younger individuals. It might not seem like a big deal to some, but an average 26 year old is much different than a 20-21 year old. Maybe I seem like the asshole here, I don't know. It's kind of hard to capture in words how I feel about the job as a whole. I would say, overall, I'm not happy, but it has very little to do with the requirements of my job and more so with the people I have to pretend to like.

I also know that I cannot and will not bartend forever. On top of it being a high-stress job, it is also unhealthy to stand for 7-8 hours straight, which I often do. 

What should I do? Should I quit now, or go down to a couple shifts a week to ease myself into the new transition? I have a large amount of bills; adjusting to being paid approximately $1500 biweekly would be definitely be difficult. However, I have done virtually nothing but work in a restaurant my entire 10-year working life. I need to do something different and get experience in a new field, but from a financial standpoint, could I be making a mistake?"
94ea3n,1,2018-08-03,My YWAM and Beyond Story,WeldingTorch21,u_WeldingTorch21,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_WeldingTorch21/comments/94ea3n/my_ywam_and_beyond_story/,"Hello reddit, this is my first post and it seems there’s a supportive community here and I’m here to discuss my YWAM and post YWAM story, there’s a lot that goes into this story and everyone is welcome on here. So my YWAM and beyond story starts like this: a friend of mine told me to worship God for 10 minutes in order to here direction from his voice and that’s how I got confirmation to go to YWAM 4-5 years ago (I say this because I was in YWAM October-February). I went to the Orlando base in between 2013-2014 and already, I felt God move in many ways, but then came the sexual harassment from the Orlando base. India came later and as much as I enjoyed going to India, I didn’t like the mission’s outreach, you know how YWAM is (Don’t question God or authority!). We went into 5-6 Hindu temples ALL which were unclean and spiritually dark, even the hotel we stayed in I had a psychosis, that’s how dark India is and YWAM lives off of naivety LITERALLY! So after we ministered the good news and went to many Christian house churches in India, we get back home, I’m feeling ok for 2014 but not for long, I started to have really weird dreams right around Christmas and Easter, but before this, my DTS leader told me “You don’t need a Therapist after a mission’s trip!“ I had already asked him ahead of time if I was going to need a Therapist, THAT fucked my life up, because for at least 4 years, I was hearing things AND dreaming dreams I shouldn’t have been dreaming ALL because of one little white lie my DTS leader told me. 

So as the story goes: I was dreaming weird psychotic things around the holidays, 2 of those years which I saw a Psychologist who told me those things were “normal” and then came SEVERAL jobs and then I didn’t work for a year due to a couple of internships plus Welding school at my local CC. Then it hit me when after I was having a weird dream before Easter, I to,led my Mom that I didn’t want to live in my hometown anymore (that was always so even before YWAM) that I needed to see a Therapist. So after a couple of unuseful ones, I found one who seems just ok to me (he’s my Therapist still) he told me this metaphor “The gasoline was always in your psychotic state, and YWAM was the match that lit the gasoline on fire!” Then it all started to make sense but there’s another story to tell to so here it is:

So you know how I was telling you about all the weird things I was dreaming about after YWAM, well during those years I always had an image in the back of my mind of my DTS certificate burning up, it relates to what my therapist told me. But anyways I went to 3 unhealthy groups:

1. I went to a young adults group that was SO sick that I felt forced out of the group.
2. I went to a small group whose leader preached his own gospel AND defended a racist discriminator against my disorder AFTER I apologized to her so I went to the pastor of the mega Church (different from the one above) and HE didn‘t help me either. 
3. Then was the one friend who I talked about earlier who told me to worship God for two weeks, he told me “I don’t need to hear your explanation about how #2 group went in order for me to defend her!” So I cussed him out and everything and after a few group meetings he said “I don’t know how to help you anymore!” He also preached his own version of the gospel like the idiot in #2.

So I decided to ONLY do a DTS with YWAM and I CANNOT in ANY way shape or form imagine who is going through YWAM longer than a DTS God be with them! Here’s some pros and cons about YWAM:

Pros: An interesting learning environment with creative people who are Christians and love the Lord their God with all their hearts, minds and souls. You do meet good people there and you get to enjoy learning about God in an interesting way. 

Cons: The leadership feels entitled and above DTS students. They say you make “lifelong” friends there, but everyone eventually returns home to their lives. They ask you “not to speak” of what happened on your time away. There also seems to be a problem with Moral Government Theology still and is destructive heres.

How my life is in the present: I have a machining job and my Therapist told me I may have Schizoaffective Disorder due to YWAM being the match that ignited the gasoline in my body. I am trying to be a Welder at the company I am with. But I feel such a huge anvil has been released from my life when I finally let go YWAM and the other idiotic Church organizations, I am STILL a Christian, just suffering for the Faith and I am confused on which Church to go to. I still reside in my hometown in Colorado, but I am hoping to leave it soon, due to the fast drivers and of course the people here. The noises and most of the dreams are dying which is a good thing.

So if ANYONE is considering joining YWAM PLEASE read my post and ALSO ex YWAMERS or YWAMERS let’s communicate on if you are experiencing psychotic dreams or hearings."

one day, you ask me out on a date to the movies. i have a boyfriend but i hide that from you and accept to go on the date anyway. you pick me up on the weekend, and i come out of the house wearing my long sleeve black dress showing off a lot of cleavage (like [https://imgur.com/a/tcv8Qkh](https://imgur.com/a/tcv8Qkh)). i'm overly flirty and touchy with you all night, and let you compliment me and buy me dinner and drinks. i invite you over afterwards and sit on your lap and feel your boner through your pants. you've been staring at my tits all night, so i ask you if you want to touch them. you reach out to touch.

but before you can, i get a text from my boyfriend that he'll be at my place in 30 minutes, so my tone immediately changes from being flirty to annoyed, and tell you that you need to leave. you get mad at me for not telling you i had a boyfriend and for leading you on, letting you spend a lot of money on me when i already had a boyfriend. i roll my eyes at you and try to push you out the door, but you overpower me and pin me against my wall. you're not going to let me go that easily. you're going to rape me for being the dirty little slut that i am.

you have thirty minutes to do whatever you want with me, fuck me wherever &amp; however you want, bring whoever you want, and force me to do **anything** you want. be dirty please.

94f9nb,2,2018-08-03,M4F My Ditzy Bimbo Milf Neighbor,Lastofthealts,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/94f9nb/m4f_my_ditzy_bimbo_milf_neighbor/,"* I like to set the scene before giving the general idea of the story so if you want, just skip down to the last few paragraphs *
        
“Oh my gosh thank you for coming over so fast Ben, I just texted you ” my new neighbor sandra babbled happily as she opened the door for me. She and her husband bob hand moved in a few weeks ago, and she was already my favorite neighbor if you know what I mean. At first I had thought she was just like any other smoking hot suburban milf, but she had soon disavowed me of that notion. The first giveaway was her the myriad of inappropriate outfits she as always wearing. She didn’t seem to have a sense of propriety, and she thought nothing of wearing a skimpy low cut top and skirt when she had me, the 18 year old neighbor over. 

The second thing that tipped me off was the fact that she was always having mishaps with men. Like that one time she explained that her husband didn’t let her come to his office anymore because the interns had convinced her that they had to feel her tits to prove they were real. 

“I just wanted to prove to them that their boss had a naturally hot wife, I don’t know why he was so upset. It’s not like they were trying to feel me up or anything” she had explained. Or that time she called me over, frantic because she was convinced the mole on her inner thigh might be dangerous. Now, that’s not a totally unreasonable request, but she was wearing crotchless panties when I came over to take a look. It had been pure torture as examined her, my head between her legs, the musky scent of her pussy wafting into my nostrils. 

Finally, she just wasn’t too bright all around. Like now, she had called me over because the TV wasn’t working. All it needed was to be plugged into the wall, but she didn’t realize. 

So, she was a Ditz, plain and simple. I hadn’t even tried to take advantage of her as of yet, maybe being late to puberty may have had something to do with that, but the ideas had been steadily building for the last  few weeks, and I knew I didn’t have the self control to stay pure much longer. 

*end of setting* 


Hey all. I think the general idea I’m going for is pretty clear, but I’ll do my best to explain as best I can. I don’t like the typical description of bimbo on her. It’s usually used to mean a cock hungry whore, but that’s not really it. A bimbo is a woman who is perfectly capable of enjoying sex like everyone else, but she’s a bit gullible. She loves her husband, and she recognizes the usual signs of sexual activity. For example, when someone is trying to take advantage of her she’ll usually say something like “oh, but won’t my husband be mad?” But she’s usually easily placated. So I’m looking for someone willing to play that role. If that sounds like something you’d be up for, I can wait to talk. "

It had been at least a year since my last relationship ended.

That must have been the only reason I didn't shut him down from the start.

One long, depressing year of mourning, frustration, and a handful of bad dates. Working at the library didn't exactly create a lot of opportunities to meet single men.

One year without sex. Even longer, really, considering the last few months with Peter had not been a time we were getting along.

That's the only explanation. That, and maybe the fact that I'd had a few drinks.

It was a Thursday night. I was in a strange town sitting in a bar without a date. And I was being hit on by a guy who was barely half my age. I was about to turn 40. He couldn't have been more than 23. Mathematically, he was young enough to be my son.

And, yet, I wasn't doing a thing to discourage him.

It was the weekend of my intern's wedding. Rachel had just finished her undergraduate degree the previous spring. She was in graduate school and working on her masters in library science. That's how she'd come to work for me. We'd developed a pretty good relationship, despite our age difference. She told me that she thought of me as the ""cool"" aunt she'd never had--which surprised me. Nobody had ever considered me ""cool"" when I was her age. When she'd invited me to her wedding I felt flattered and obliged to attend, even though it was out of town and I had to drive down on my own. I'd come down that day to the quiet little beach town and the group of people who'd already arrived decided to get together in a bar near the hotel.

Robin was one of the groomsmen. He wasn't the best looking of the bunch and not the most polished, but he was attractive--tall and lean with a fit body. He was a bit dorky in the way most young men are, even if they don't realize it. But he was also apparently the most confident. Or maybe that was just because he'd drank the most. And because he happened to be the one sitting next to me at the bar as the crown thinned out and guests started heading back to the hotel.

Ninety percent of the time I would have just found the flirting cute, a bit silly, and would have politely sent him on his way. But it had been so long for me...and I was drinking...and out of town...at a wedding, which always seems to make a single person feel a little bit lonely.

I've always been a ""good"" girl. I was late to develop and a little plump growing up and in college. I was shy. I didn't have many close friends. As a result, I turned to books. I went to a college that was predominantly female and got a degree that few men get. And then I went into a profession dominated by women. By the time I'd really come into my own--physically and mentally--I had already become the type of adult woman who prefers quiet evenings at home and long term relationships over playing the field. I always assumed one of those relationship would lead to marriage, but it hadn't worked out that way for various reasons.

With long blond hair, a fit body, and curves for days, I knew I'd developed into the type of woman that could catch a man's eye. But, I've always felt awkward in social situations and have never been particularly outgoing, so I never seem to hit it off with men.

But none of that seemed to matter to Robin. He'd started out conservatively. It was obvious that he was flirting, but he wasn't being overt.

""I've always liked women older than me,"" he said at one point. ""They just seem more intelligent than women my age."" It sounded like a rehearsed line of bullshit, but I smiled politely.

But the more he drank, the more forward he became. And I'd catch him staring at my body.

I wasn't dressed very provocatively--but it was less conservative than my usual style. I had on black heels and stockings with a black sundress covered in a very bright, floral pattern. It seemed appropriate for the beach. It had a full skirt that came past my knees and a V-neckline that couldn't help but show off my chest.

That's where I kept finding Robin's eyes. On my tits. He'd start off looking me in the eyes when he was speaking, but eventually they'd drift down in the most obvious fashion.

Maybe it was the alcohol. Maybe it was being out of down. Or maybe I was just happy to have someone pay so much attention to me after such a long layoff. But I made a conscious decision to play along. To flirt back just a little. To see how he responded. It seemed it would be good for a laugh.

""You know, you're very beautiful, Chellee,"" he said. ""How old are you?""

""A lady never answers that question,"" I said. ""Aren't you old enough to know better?""

""How old do you think I am?"" he asked.

I guessed correctly that he was 23.

""Almost 24, though. In a couple of months. Won't you tell me how old you are?"" He flashed a crooked smile. I wondered if that was something that had worked for him with girls his own age.

""How old do you think I am?"" I asked.

""I don't know. Thirty-three?""

I couldn't honestly tell if he was trying to flatter me or he really thought I was that young. Maybe it was a little of both.

""Really? Is that what you really think?"" I asked.

""Maybe 35. Max. Like a very young 35, though.""

I couldn't help feeling good about that. I knew I looked a little younger than my age. And I was certainly in better shape than most of my peers. But I still liked the compliment.

""You're really beautiful,"" he said again. ""And I like talking to you. You're smart. And cool. You're Rachel's aunt, right? She said you were her 'cool' aunt.""

""I'm not actually her aunt,"" I said. ""She just says that. I'm her boss.""

""Oh,"" he said. ""Well I'm not really close with Rachel. I mean, I'm her friend, but I'm really more of the groom's friend. So you work at the library?""

""Yes,"" I responded.

""So you're like the cool, sexy librarian?"" he asked.

I laughed at that.

""Is that a line, Robin? It sound like a line. Are you hitting on me?"" I said with a smile.

""No,"" he said. ""No. Well, I mean, maybe a little. But no. I was telling the truth. You're really beautiful!""

""What do you find so beautiful about me?"" I asked. I scooted just a little bit closer to him. The bar was really starting to empty out. Most of the people we knew had left. Robin had told his buddies he'd catch up to them later. But all that was waiting for me was a lonely hotel room.

""Everything,"" he said. ""I really like your beautiful blue eyes, though.""

""Those aren't my eyes,"" I said. Robin's glance had once again drifted downward.

There was a look of embarrassment for a second about being caught ogling my tits. I could almost see the wheels turning in his head as he decided how to recover. And then, as if a switch flipped, he apparently decided to push his chips to the center of the table and go all in.

""Well, I like your tits, too. You've got great tits.""

I blushed a little bit. I couldn't believe he was being so direct. I decided that maybe he'd had too much to drink and it was time to end the conversation.

""I'm not sure that's the best way for you to talk to a lady,"" I said. ""I think we should call it a night. I'll assume you just drank too much and didn't mean to say that.""

I stood up off the stool and put money on the bar for my drink.

He jumped up and stood next to me.

""Hey, Chellee. Don't be offended!"" he said.

Then he looked down again and didn't even attempt to hide it.

""But, damn, really. You have great tits. I meant it.""

""Good night, Robin,"" I said.

He put a hand on my waist and gently pulled my closer to him. It wasn't intentional, but I brushed my thigh against his crotch. He was rock hard. I could feel it. And it excited me just a bit. He put his lips near my ear.

""Come on,"" he said. ""When is the last time you've been fucked hard and long by a guy ten years younger than you?""

The answer to his question was ""never."" I'd never been fucked by a guy much younger than me. And he was a lot more than 10 years younger, though he didn't know it.

It had been SO long since I'd been fucked hard by anyone. Or fucked in any way. And I hadn't fucked a boy his age since my college boyfriend--when I was even younger than Robin.

He pushed his crotch into my thigh. This time he was making a conscious effort for me to feel his hard prick.

""I'm hard from just looking at you,"" he said. ""I PROMISE we will have a good time.""

He was getting me wet. Against my better judgment, I could feel myself contemplating the possibility. He did have a sexy body. He took my hand and ran it over his prick, letting me feel him through his khakis. It was definitely a thick piece of meat. Boldly, he leaned in and kissed me. And I could just feel myself letting go to him.

""Let's go back to my room for one more drink,"" he whispered.

My mind was racing.

""What the hell am I doing?"" I thought silently. ""Why the hell not?"" was my second thought. I was out of town. I'd likely never see him again. I knew nobody at the wedding except for Rachel. And what had being a ""good girl"" gotten me my entire life? I wasn't miserable, but my life hadn't exactly lived up to my best dreams. ""I'm almost 40,"" I thought. ""Why not have fun? Just this once?"" It would be harmless. An adventure. And a self-esteem boost.

""OK,"" I said. ""I'll have one more drink with you. But not in your room.""

Robin nodded and started to sit back on his stool.

""Not here,"" I said. ""How about over there?"" I pointed in the direction of a round booth in a dark corner of the bar. It would definitely be private and a bit more intimate.

Robin agreed and we went to the booth. He took a seat on one side. I entered in the other direction and moved all the way to the middle. I patted the bench next to me.

""Scoot over,"" I said. ""Get next to me.""

He moved closer, leaving a space between us. I responded by sliding closer to him until our thighs were touching. I could see the look of surprise on his face. He obviously wasn't sure what to expect. I imagined that in his mind he'd never thought something might really happen.

I put a hand on his thigh and ran it up to his crotch. His hard cock was going down the right leg of his pants--the leg pressed firmly against my left one. I started to caress it softly through his khakis.

""Ohhhh..."" he said. It was something between an exhale and a surprised moan of pleasure.

I slid my hand up and down, firmly pressing his cock into his own thigh. I could feel the heat through his pants.

""Mmmmm..."" he moaned again. The slick, forward personality was all but gone. He'd regressed into a surprised boy.

A waitress came over to take our order. With my hand still on his cock--safely hidden beneath the table in the dark--I calmly ordered myself another glass of wine. While I was still conversing with the waitress I moved my hand around until I found his zipper. And then I gave it a slow tug downward. I felt so naughty! I had NEVER done anything comparable in my life!

""And for you, sir?"" the girl asked.

""What? Huh?"" Robin said as he glanced up. He was very obviously flustered. ""I...um...I want....""

My hand was in his trousers and fishing around for his cock as he talked. I found it and gripped it tightly.

Robin stumbled through his drink order while I slowly, rhythmically tugged on his piece.

""Oh. OH. That feels so good..."" Robin said when the waitress left.

""Shhhh! You'll give us away. You don't want it to end do you?"" I asked.

""NO!!""

""Then be cool.""

He slumped back in the booth and tried his best to look nonchalant. I kept rubbing him off. I couldn't believe my own behavior, but it was making me hot!

Robin's breathing was getting heavy. He moved his hips, trying to force me to go faster, but I wanted it to last. I glanced across the room and saw the waitress picking up two drinks that looked like our order. As she turned to come back to us, I pulled Robin's cock out through his zipper. I couldn't help but to glance down. The table would hide anyone else's view but mine. It really was a nice, thick tool.

Robin appeared to be in a state of shock. I squeezed my hand tight around the head and started tugging faster. As people walked by, I was aware they might be able to see my arm moving. But they couldn't be sure of what was happening.

When the waitress got close I stopped pumping him. With my thumb, I rubbed the tip of his dick. I could feel little, sticky droplets of cum, and I smeared them around. Robin looked like he was in a stupor.

""Are you going to pay the lady?"" I asked him.

""Oh...uh...yeah,"" he said.

He fumbled for his wallet. I was still tickling his cock at the cum hole with the tip of my thumb. He pulled out a 20--way more than our drinks would cost even including a decent tip--and told her to just keep it. Obviously, he wanted her to get lost.

I picked up my drink with my free hand and took a sip. As soon as her back was turned, I went back to jacking him off forcefully.

""Drink your drink,"" I said.

Robin picked it up and gulped the whole glass down--some sort of whiskey concoction.

Two girls walked by and one of them did a double-take. I was certain she knew what was happening. Or at least suspected it. And I didn't care. For the first time in my life, I WANTED to be bad. I winked at her. Then leaned close to Robin.

""Do you like the way I'm touching you?""

He just nodded. Emphatically.

I looked around, and then casually opened the very top button on my sundress. My black bra was now exposed. I watched Robin's eyes fall on to the deep chasm between my tits.

""You like them?"" I asked Robin.

""Yesss..."" he said.

I ran my hand up and down his shaft a few times. I grasped the head and started pulling as fast as I could. I squeezed it firmly and he groaned in response. At this point, anyone looking what have realized exactly what was happening.

""You like the way I'm tugging your cock, baby?"" I whispered. It was phrase I'd never uttered in my life. Never thought I would say.

""Yes..."" he said again. ""Please don't stop,"" he almost whimpered.

""You want to cum?""

""YES!"" he said.

I gave him such firm tugs that I thought he might cum out of the seat. Robin groaned and grunted. And then he exploded. I felt some of his hot cum running down my hand.

I didn't stop until he was finished and gasping for air. I pulled my hand up to the table and looked at his jizz. I reached for my cocktail napkin. Then something else came to mind. Looking Robin dead in the eye and licked his seed off my fingers. Then wiped my lips with the napkin.

""Who the hell am I tonight?"" I thought silently.

""Well, I hope you enjoyed the drink. I'm glad I stayed,"" I said getting up.

""Wait. No. Wait,"" Robin stammered. ""Let me pay you back. Let me do something for you.""

My intention had been to just walk out. I didn't want things to go any farther. But I could feel that my little black panties were soaked. Instead of settling my craving for sex, jacking Robin off in the back of the bar had just made me hungry for more. I wanted a release. I wanted to just rush back to the hotel and take a hot bath and get myself off. But I knew I could have more fun.

""Don't be a prude,"" I told myself.

""Why don't you walk me back to the hotel?"" I heard myself say out loud. ""We'll see what happens.""

We slipped out a side door from the bar into a tiny alley between buildings. The boardwalk was out front. Beyond that was the beach. Robin was still dazed, but it looked like he was slowly regaining some of his swagger. We'd only walked a few steps when he firmly pushed me against the brick wall.

Robin went straight for my tits. He buried his face in them. And then he rubbed one roughly when he kissed me. He was sort of clumsy. A bit inexperienced. But I still liked it.

I glanced around. There was a large dumpster 50 feet up the alley before the boardwalk. I knew it was hiding us from the view of anyone passing by. But if anyone else left the bar by the side door they'd stumble right on us.

It didn't seem that Robin had any concern about location. He pushed the skirt of my dress between my lefts and started rubbing my pussy.

""I want to taste you!"" he said.

""Right here?""

""After what you did inside?"" he said. ""Yes. Right here.""

He grabbed the hem of my skirt and lifted it all the way up. There wasn't much finesse to his style, like I'd become used to with older men. His hand went right to the crotch of my panties and pushed it aside. He didn't bother with the clit. He just slammed two fingers up into me.

I whimpered a little bit with delight. He wasn't delicate in any way. He just started pounding me with those two fingers. The sound of his palm slamming into my flesh filled the alley. I tried to stifle my cries, but every once in a while one would slip and echo off the brick walls. I was ready to cum when he suddenly stopped.

Robin dropped to his knees in the dirty alley. He put his torso beneath my skirt. I felt him pulling my panties down to mid-thigh. And then I felt his tongue.

He may have been an awkward kisser, but the boy knew exactly what he was doing when it came to eating pussy. I felt myself go weak in the knees. He clenched my ass cheeks firmly with each hand, pulling me closer to him. He was like a rattle snake, flicking his tongue rapidly over my clit. He brought a hand back around and started fingering me again. I put my hands on my own tits. I could feel my hard nipples. I tossed my head back and closed my eyes. I moaned loudly. And then I just let out a cry. And then another. I didn't care if someone heard us. With his rough tongue sliding up and down my clit I had my first orgasm with another person in over a year. It was massive. My entire body quivered and trembled. There was a pleasant shock waves starting at my clit and shooting in every direction through my body.

He pulled his head back out from the skirt and smiled up from the street. I lifted the skirt to pull my panties up when the side door to the bar swung open and a few people stumbled out. The glanced at us, and it had to be obvious they had just missed something.

""Let's get out of here!"" I said and grabbed Robin's hand without thinking.

Without looking back we fled the alley and turned in the direction of the hotel.

Moment later we were in the hotel elevator. I hadn't even thought about what was going to happen next. I was still feeling great. And maybe a little embarrassed about how close we'd come to being caught. I hit a button on the elevator.

""That's my floor, too,"" he said.

We got off on the same floor.

""Your room or mine?"" he said.

It had definitely never been my intention to let things go that far. But without even thinking about things or about whether we should call it a night, I just answered him.

""Mine,"" I said.

Before the door to the room even closed I was at the buttons on his shirt. I wanted to fuck more than at any time in my life. I got impatient and just tried to pull the shirt over his head. Buttons popped and flew across the room.

He unbuttoned my dress down to the waist. I shrugged out of it and stood there in black heels, stockings, panties, and bra--I've always been one of those strangely OCD women who almost always matches my underwear. Robin looked stunned. He gazed at my tits. And my flat stomach. And my muscular legs.

I got his pants undone and they hit the floor. His boxers followed.

His cock was already getting hard again, but I decided to help him out. He leaned against the wall in the foyer of the room while I dropped to my knees. I took his thick cock between my full lips. I could taste the cum from earlier all over the head.

I bobbed up and down as Robin ran his fingers through my long, blond hair. He got stiff quickly, but I didn't want to stop right away.

""I want to fuck,"" he said.

""Mmm hmm..."" I said, with a mouthful of cock. I slipped my lips off and licked around he head. I tickled the cum hole with the tip of my tongue.

""Can you back up what you said in the bar?"" I asked.

""What's that?"" he asked. ""I kind of forgot. I was a little drunker then...""

""You asked me when was the last time I was fucked long and hard? Can you do that?""

""Yes!"" he said.

I stood up and took my bra off. I thought his jaw would hit the floor as he gazed at my big tits.

""Do you fuck like a boy, or can you fuck me like a man?"" I asked, before thinking silently ""who am I tonight?"" again.

""I'll fuck you like a MAN,"" he said with conviction.

He grabbed my arm and roughly pulled me to the bed. Then he pushed me down playfully. Lying on the bed I hooked two thumbs in my panties and pulled them off. I spread me legs so that I was on my back, with nothing covering me up except the stockings, the heels, and the small path of hair above my pussy.

Again, Robin wasn't one for foreplay. He jumped on the bed and started kissing my roughly. He kneaded my titties with his hands. And then he got on top and drove that nice, thick cock up inside me.

He was so thick I felt like I was being split open. It had been SO long since I'd had sex. And my ex had just had the standard, average, seven inch white guy cock. Robin's was FAT.

He didn't fuck as well as he ate pussy, but it was better than he kissed. There was no change of pace. He just fucked hard and fast--like he needed to cum inside me. And I liked it.

I dug my nails into Robin's back.

""Oh, fuck me. Fuck me..."" I heard myself moaning aloud.

""You like that? You like that?"" he kept saying.

His body was dripping with sweat. His breath came in hot little gasps. And still he never broke pace. His fat cock rubbed my clit with every stroke and I felt myself losing control. I called out his name. I gasped. And I came hard. I couldn't stop myself from digging my nails into his back.

He just went harder. He was like a fucking animal plowing into me. His face was locked in a distorted grimace. His moans were almost like growls.

Just the sound of the two of us fucking and his machine like rhythm brought me to the brink again. I felt my pussy clench as I came for the second time since we'd started fucking.

And still he kept going. Robin grabbed both my legs. He through my heels over his shoulder. The point of my black heels were pointed skyward. Suddenly it was like he had another gear. He slammed into my like a speeding truck into a brick wall. With each thrust he growled loudly. I cried out every time. He slowed down just a bit to deliver hard, deep strokes. I started rubbing my own clit, desperate to cum one more time with him.

It was close to a simultaneous orgasm. I could feel his hot load spraying inside me as the waves of pleasure washed over me. Robin kept right on fucking until he squeezed every drop into me.

He rolled off and the two of tried to catch our breath while we stared at the ceiling.

""Did I fuck you like a man?"" he finally asked.

""That depends,"" I said. ""You got one more in you tonight?""

He looked down at his own cock. I followed his gaze. He was already getting hard again. I'd forgotten that particular advantage of being with a young man!

""What do you think?"" he asked.

And then he rolled over and started fucking me one more time....

As part of my compensation for the internship, I was invited to the movie premiere. I got myself a new suit, dressed up and walked along with everyone else that was involved in the movie, getting a taste for this life and wanting more.

It was at this premiere where I saw you again, like I usually did, except this time you were alone, and you looked stunning. You were seated at the bar, having a drink, and I figured now would probably be my last chance to say something. So, I downed the rest of my drink and walked over to you.

She said she knows she is the bad guy, and she apologized. I accepted it, we are generally having a healthy relationship now, but I feel broken and confused.**

Hi everyone,

This happened to me within the last two weeks, but have possibly been developing in the past month. I actually looked up Reddit to see if there are any places I can seek help with this, so this is literally my first time posting without knowing much of the rules. I hope you all can tolerate some minor mistakes I may make. The story's long and I'm emotional right now, so I hope you guys will be understanding.

We have been dating for almost 2 years. We started it all out when we got to college (we are still in college). We broke up once because at that time she was not sure she got over her ex yet, but then we got back together and have been strong up to recently. We were really serious and spent a lot of time contemplating long-term plans with each other - I'm talking like where I will go to graduate school and how it can relate to her own plans, and how we can find jobs in the same city and stuff like that.

Now, the background to this story comes from us wanting to do a semester abroad. After much planning and admittedly some bickering (doing a semester abroad for my major is extremely hard), we decided to try country A. At first, she was really on board with the plan, and she even was pushing me to apply as soon as possible. We were happy with each other, and we were happy with our plan. I even told her that if we couldn't do country A, I would be okay with her going abroad alone.

Comes this summer. She got a really nice internship out-of-state, while I stay back at school to do research. In essence, we were separated for a few months. Now, one thing to know about me is that I'm a very emotional guy, and living alone (which was not my forte) in the summer while trying to deal with the stress of research is a lot for me. I talk to her on the phone a lot, and we would message each other pretty much daily throughout the day. I probably complained to her a lot, but when I do that I usually just want her to tell me encouraging things while being the cute and cuddly girl that I love. She noted that it is hard for me without her. Regardless, we spent a lot of other quality time with each other. We even watched the World Cup together through Skype, and generally we were really happy with each other.

A few weeks ago, she told me how she felt really guilty about two things: that she ""left"" me to live here alone, and that I probably miss her a lot more than she misses me (which I find fine - my life here is harder, and I have a harder time finding friends than she does). I of course told her it was no problem, that I'd love her still and I'd fight for a great future for me and her.

But then, gradually she became distant. She replies to me less, and somehow I feel that she cares a bit less about things happening on my end. I admit I did not deal with this in the best way, but generally the most I did was complain about it and jokingly demand her attention. She told me things like she was feeling so much guilt, that she's been having swings in her thoughts, and that she is bothered that I love her way more than she loves me. Those words probably hit me a bit, but I try my best to encourage her, to tell her that it is okay.

All the while, she's been telling me that her life at the state she is staying at is great. She made a lot of new friends, went to different places, talked to different people. I honestly feel good about it - when in college, she would be a lot more closed to herself and only open to me. She told me that she felt a bit sad that she will have to leave to return to college soon. I really understood that, and I even told her that I'd consider going to grad school at the same state (which is actually a great school to go to). I honestly want her to be happy, and if I could help it, I would adjust my plans to be with her and have her be in a place she likes.

Then, one day, she told me about school B to spend a semester abroad at. Honestly, a great school, and I'm definitely on board with it. Initially, we agreed on her doing school B if our plan for school A failed. I know that in her heart she likes school B better, but our plan had always been school A.

The bad things started coming when she said she really (and I mean really) like school B. I can tell she reads up a lot on it, and that she seriously considers it. Now, at this point, I would like to make a point that she cares a lot about preparing for the future - she reads career blogs and finance blogs, thinking about and trying out things like investment. She thinks about how her life is going to be like a lot, and she can analyze every aspect that she could think of to the greatest detail. Hell, we even had a conversation about how I could be a great fit to her life plan. But the main point is that, if she's reached a decision, she's really going to do it and she's thought about it a lot.

So, at this point, she told me that she really wanted to do school B, and that she may not even consider school A. Now, while I think I would support her doing school B, I obviously didn't like it too much - if she did school B, we would be apart for way longer than this summer. I didn't react well to it, and I was angry with her for half a day - I even momentarily blocked her on messaging. To me, it felt like a betrayal - I had invested a lot in doing school A, and I really hoped for it a lot, and she just decided that school B is for her.

I cried on the phone with her. I did not really think that she was going to do such a thing - she obviously knows that doing such a thing would hurt me. I didn't mind that she was going away from me, I minded that she abandoned a plan we had together for so long to pursue something else, knowing that it will hurt me a lot. She acknowledges it and she apologized profusely. But she stood her ground. She said from her experience talking to people in the internship, she wanted to go out there and explore, But more importantly, she said she wanted to have space for herself to explore other things.

She told me that to her, the worst thing at that point right now is not being able to be with me, and possibly losing me as a friend - me breaking up with her would not be the worst thing for her. I felt devastated that she would say such a thing. I didn't react well to it. She understood and she apologizes. But she said she didn't know what she felt about the relationship. She wanted to go out there.

She told me that she would feel really guilty if she left me behind and go to school B. I told her one of my personal philosophies about love: I am okay with her going and I am not likely to break up with her over that, but what matters is whether she loves me enough to do her thing and live with the guilt that was associated with it.

She said no.

She then said that she's had a lot of new perspective from her internship. That she's young, and she wants to know what she could do. And she said she doesn't love me enough to sacrifice some of that for our long-term plans and commit to me. She said she really wanted me as a friend, and she's still okay with me being her boyfriend. But she wants to loosen up to an open relationship, because as I said, she doesn't love me enough to commit so much. She said it was on her side - she felt that I am a perfectly good guy to be with, but she's not feeling it.

I was broken beyond belief, you see. But honestly, I felt that it was the only way she's going to accept me in any form of a relationship at that moment. I said yes, and we ended the conversation amicably.

In the next few days, we still talked, sometimes even joked about the argument. But the slight coldness was there, and my sadness was there. Life wasn't great.

Then, a few days ago, on the night of her birthday, I called her to wish her happy birthday. Our talk went well at first, and at that point I decided to tell her how much I love her, and stuff like that. She didn't respond well, and she reiterated her desire to be freed up. That time, she said that it included seeing other guys. She asked if I was okay with that.

For probably the longest hour ever, I said no, and I tried to convince her to try to love me back. But all I heard was no. She kept telling me that she felt pushed away further if I keep holding onto her so much like this, that she couldn't trust me to be stable enough to lend her the freedom she wants. We both were a mess then. She told me that when I got angry at her over the school B thing, she couldn't feel anything. She was thinking that not an open relationship would even work - that we will have to go back to being friends only.

It took me a while, but I told her that I will accept the uncertainty, and that we officially would be in an open relationship. She accepted it and she was relieved. But honestly, I am very, very hurt. I told her that, and she said she wished she felt hurt the same way as I did. She told me that she is the bad guy in the situation. I told her it was okay.

Right now, we are talking amicably. She got back some of her mannerisms she used to have while we were in the madly in love phase, and generally it was amicable. Throughout our relationships, we were very honest with each other, and we would tell each other any bad/toxic thought that any one of us had. I still do that. Sometimes we hit a slightly low note, and she'd get annoyed and I'd be sad, but right now, it's okay. I'm even flying out to see her tomorrow (that, not a thing I did after that happened - we planned for this trip). Right now, we agreed to take on a ""wait and see"" mentality. I asked her if she'd still see me as her boyfriend when I visited. She said yes.

But honestly, I don't know how to feel. I know I'm really hurt and broken inside, but aside from that I don't know what to even think. I talked to some of my best friends about it, and honestly they are all like ""Why are you even sticking with her?"", ""I can't believe what she's doing to you"", ""What she's doing is messed up"".

I don't want to see her as the villain here. I have always thought that in things like this, treat everyone involved including her as an ally and work towards solving the problem. But I don't know if she is working towards solving it or not. Looking back, sometimes I would tell myself that maybe I was controlling over her and I should have given her more space and things like that. Sometimes someone would ask me if she has done anything to keep the relationship like I did. Sometimes I do feel that it makes sense, that she's not for me and I should just let go, that I've been barking up the wrong tree the whole time. Sometimes I read an article about how it could be indicative of something, how it could be just a phase, how it probably could have been the wrong place at the wrong time. And as I have probably mentioned, she did explicitly say that she thinks we as a couple is a great thing in itself, but she is just not feeling it.

I don't know guys. I need some perspective.

Right now, my line of thought is that if I leave her be for a while, there is a chance she could come back appreciating my love more. And if not, I could find someone who would be better for me.

I tried to tell the story as objectively accurate as possible. But honestly, I am human and I am emotional. I know it resulted in a very long post, and I am very very sorry if it is a bad thing to do here. But thank you so much for reading my story. And I really appreciate it if I could get some good advice.

Thank you, and good night."

Tips anyone?,CYPJuicy9,pharmacy,https://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/94gxee/suffering_from_workrelated_anxiety_tips_anyone/,"I’m in need of tips and ideas badly. Did anyone else experience overwhelming stress and anxiety as a first time soloing pharmacist at CVStress? 

I’ve always been an intern/tech and I was damn good at it. I was always doing everything so my pharmacists didn’t have to lift a finger. 

But now....being the only pharmacist in a pharmacy full of techs who can’t do much.....I am so overwhelmed with all the “attacks” coming at me. Dr calling, patients wanting to chit chat for 30 mins, patients asking where coconut oil is, voicemails, PCQ calls, request calls, re-verification.....9 PM readyfills. AHHHHH!!!! 

Try doing that at 5-7 pm traffic with only 2 techs...*barely new* techs who can’t even pick up phone calls yet. I see now why my pharmacists are always dying for good help and interns. 

My anxiety is triggered the moment I open my eyes in bed and stays steady throughout the day at the pharmacy. Palpitations, tachycardia, etc. 

Idk how to control it."

I was an only child which kinda fucked me up. I’ve got serious worthlessness, loneliness, and self esteem issues because I’ve never felt I had anyone to talk to about my problems. 

A couple months ago, my girlfriend broke up with me. It was my first relationship and it lasted over a year. It was great. I felt like I was truly loved for who I was. 

I was super motivating to her and helped her get her an internship for the summer. At that internship, she met many new people, which I thought was a good thing. I was wrong. 

When she would talk to me about her friends in her internship, there was one guy who she seemed to have a good friendship with. I never questioned it. Our relationship was going great. We had been together for about a year and I didn’t wanna be one of those controlling boyfriends who didn’t let his girl talk to other people. 

Then suddenly, for the next 2 weeks, she gave me the cold shoulder out of nowhere. I asked her many times what was wrong, she always said she was fine. Then one day, she ended things with me. 

Now, 2 months later, I see her on Snapchat with her new boyfriend: the “special” guy from her internship. 

I’ve never felt so betrayed in my entire fucking life. I feel used. I feel worthless. My self esteem has never been worse. Were the last 12 months just her waiting to find someone better? Was I just filling time? 

I wanna die. 

Apparently, just 2 weeks of talking to this new guy was enough to end our entire relationship. 

I wanna die. I’ve always been supportive to all my friends, but no ones ever done it back. 

I’ve started seeing a counsellor, but it’s not helping that much. I’m so alone that I’d rather  spend $180 per hour to talk to a total fucking stranger than ever bring up this conversation with friends or family. 

I honestly don’t know how much longer I can take this. I’ve got zero self esteem. Zero relationships I can trust or rely on. I have nothing. 

I’ve been depressed for years and this is the second time I’ve ever seriously considered suicide. 

I just needed to get this off my chest. I just wanna scream. I need help. If any of you have any advice, please help. I don’t know how much longer I can take this. "
94hele,4,2018-08-04,I made a video game. It saved my life.,throwaway15453525,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/94hele/i_made_a_video_game_it_saved_my_life/,"So I just finished writing this and wow, I really got carried away. This is way longer than I intended. I thought about cutting it down but to be honest, I'm posting this here me. So read it if you want, or just read my snarky little TL;DR. Really, I just feel like this has been hanging on to the back of my mind for a long time. So it's time to let it out, and it's time to let go. 

 It feels weirdly silly looking back on it. Maybe that's just because of the weird subject matter, I don't know.

Also quick note: this story paints my parents in a really unfair light. So I'd just like to say, my parents are amazingly awesome. They want only what's best for me, and they'll never know the pain they helped cause because I'll never let them know. I love my parents with all my heart, and I blame them for nothing.

TL;DR   I was either gonna kill myself or make video games. Decided to make video games.

\---------------

I grew up in a very academics-oriented household. The general idea was that grades were the most important thing ever for the first 18 years of your life. Why? Well good grades means good college means good job (and good money) means good life. Now when I say good grades, I mean that throughout high school, if I came home with anything short of an A on a test, I was punished. If at the end of a quarter I wasn't on high-honor roll, I was in for a bad week. Even hitting just regular honor-roll got me the disappointed ""try to do better next time"" speech. 

The problem was that the older I got, the less happy I was with the ""good grades to good life"" plan that had been instilled in me from day one. It started to seem like my life was being set up as a series of obstacles that I just had to power my way through, and if I got through all of them then I'd be happy at the end. And I was never really introduced to any other worldview in a way that made it seem like a feasible outcome, so I always thought that everyone saw it this way, and that the ""get through it"" pathway was just how life worked.

Long story short, my outlook on life meant that I lost all motivation to get good grades. Bad grades leads to a lot of trouble between me and my parents. They throw out punishments, but the depressed/rebellious little shit in me didn't really care and just continued to let my grades slide.

This was how my first two years of high school went. And as time went on and I slipped further and further down this rabbit hole, and I got closer and closer to what was, unequivocally, the worst period of my life. I started to think about how if life was just going to be a series of painful steps, why even bother? Why not just end it all? Quick, easy, over. It started off small. Just a little mid-day fantasy, something nice to think about, but nothing I'd ever actually do. Over the course of my first two years of high school, fantasy inched its way towards reality.

For as long as I live, I will never forget the importance of the number 7. 

7 times I came home from school. 

7 times I witnessed the problems I had caused.

7 times I looked ahead to the life I never wanted to live. 

7 times I genuinely weighed the option of suicide. 

Before the rest of the story, it's an important side note to mention that growing up, making video games was my absolute dream job. I'd liken it to being an actor or a professional sports player. Where a lot of kids would look to those professions as the sort of ""man I'd love to do that but that'd could never actually happen"" types of jobs, that's largely how I always felt about game development. 

So in the summer between Sophomore and Junior year, I was stuck in this depressed, almost emotionally vegetative state. I wanted to enjoy my time off, but I knew that it ended with going back to school, and back to all the problems. As I sat wasting away the summer, in a sudden moment that I wish with all my being I could remember the specifics of, that dream game development job hit me like a ton of bricks. If life was cruel and I was just going to end it short, then what the hell do I have to lose?

So I made a deal with myself. A decision that I truly believe, three years later, saved my life. Before I go, I want to be able to say that I did the one thing I dreamed of doing. As funny as it sounds, to me it was an integral part of my human experience to be able to create a video game that was completely my own. Something that only existed because I made it exist. The deal: I'm not allowed to die until I've made a video game.

So I spent a few days doing research. It started with the obvious ""hey google how do I make a video game"". But as I started looking into it, I started to realize that I could actually go to college for game development. And from there, it became a real, obtainable career. This opened up a whole new world that I never knew existed. At that moment, the strangest, most wonderful thing happened. It was like a switch was buried deep down in the very core of my mind, and that switch was flipped. The endless void that I had convinced myself I was trapped in was no longer endless. All the sudden I saw the escape, I just had to get there.

And that's where things stopped being a fairy tale as quickly as they started. You see, I had my eyes set on a handful of colleges, but those colleges definitely did not have their eyes set on me. Turns out that game development programs weren't easy to get into, and my ""I hate my life"" grades weren't even close to enough. Things weren't looking good, and I saw absolutely no humor in the irony that my depression grades were now holding me back from the one thing that could maybe pull me out of it.

So I went into my Junior year of high school not with a depressed ""fuck you life"" attitude, but with a vengeful ""fuck you life"" attitude. If life was just going to constantly kick me while I was down, then I saw these next two years as my one and only chance to kick it back.

And boy did I kick.

It wasn't easy, but my grades started to skyrocket. I decided to enroll in some programming courses and found that I absolutely loved it. I began to appreciate my math classes more because I started to see how they would relate to making games. I still hated most classes, but something about having a real concrete goal, a goal that was so high stakes and so now or never, made it so much more bearable. I still hated high school. I still thought it was just an obstacle to get through. But now it was the last obstacle, whether than meant college or...option two. 

I worked up some courage, and eventually sat down with my parents and explained that I wanted to go to college to make video games. I expected the worst. I expected them to have that same disappointment, wishing that I could pick a real career to strive for. And God bless them, they gave me more support than I could have ever hoped for. I could tell it wasn't easy for them, my dad especially struggling with the idea that this major even existed, but they told me that if this is what I really wanted then I needed to go for it. Of course they'll never know what was actually at stake.

So Senior year continued much the same, until it came time to apply. Long story short, the roughly 4 month span between sending out my college applications and getting the responses back was the strangest mix of clam, absolute panic, hopefulness, and dread. My grades had gotten better, but was it enough to offset the first two years? I did pretty well on the SAT, but so did all the other kids applying for the same spots I wanted. I didn't do much extracurricular activities. Maybe I don't deserve a spot. Maybe I'm just one of the many unsuccessful stories, bound to fail before I even start. Maybe this was the end.

Then I got a letter. The most life-changing (and extending) letter I've ever gotten. It was from my dream college. A college I applied to on the basis of nothing but hope and magic fairy dust. I feel like I should remember the exact words it said, I don't. But the general idea was ""congratulations, you're in"".

It's hard to believe that I opened that letter over a year and a half ago. I'm a Sophomore in college now. It's been four years since the lowest point in my life. Nowadays, I'm working an internship over summer break. It's not my ideal job, but I get to do some neat programming every once in a while, and earning some spending cash is never a bad thing. To be honest though, I'm just counting the days until I can go back to school. 

I'm 20 years old now, which is an indirect way of saying I still don't know shit about the world. There's so much left to do, so much left to learn. There's so many steps left to take, and I can't wait to take each and every one of them. It seems so odd to think that I actually wanted to end it all. Sometimes I question if I really ever did. It feels like it was too easy, like my ""cure"" was too simple and straightforward. Maybe it was, maybe I was just an over-dramatic kid who was way in over his head, still fantasizing of an end that I'd never actually follow through on. But the pain felt real, the pain was there, and now the pain is gone.

Oh and in my free time, I've been making my first real game. There's no title yet, it's really just an idea I've been throwing together, but I recently got it to a point where it's a ""playable game"". So a deal's a deal. I made a game, and now I'm allowed to die.

I think I'll pass."

Below are a few ideas, they are always up for discussion:

Boss x Intern: a 21 year old started interning at a makeup and underwear company which design the best kind of womens cosmetics and lingerie. Being a guy its almost paradise as most employees are 25-40 year olds. The boss, a 31 year old woman invites him to a xmas party. To which she thinks she will mess with him and tease him and flirt with him all night. But when it goes a bit too far she cant help but love the experience. Soon shes giving him pay rises and promotions until she steps down as chairman for him to take over. Becoming nothing more than his secutary.

Teacher x Student: A young man is failing at his college degree. So the teacher offers 1 on 1 tutoring lessons for him in the campus library. After he gets his first A* she offers the prize of her body for the night, promising every time he gets an A she'll come visit. This grows to become her giving him A's for everything just so she can be dominated by him. This could include cheating, if it does it may grow to the point of her leaving her husband for a life of being a toy.

MILF: The MILF next door knows that her neighbours son is a frustrated virgin. He cant get a date let alone lose his virginity. One night when his mother leaves for a date she comes over and offers him a deal, sex in exchamge for a months worth of chores. He agrees and starts to work for her. This would grow to her treating him like a king asking to clean his cock for his enjoyment. 

The Instagram Model: A bratty bitchy model sets up an event where people pay her money for the chance to go on a date with her. A guy wins and they go out together. Being dissapointed by him not being a tall ripped muscly guy she belittles him all evening. When it was time to take her home she reluctatly offers pity sex to him. Being annoyed at her attitude he is rough and fucks her to the point of her mind breaking. She becomes a giggly, flirty and always horny woman for him to enjoy. 

Message me if you like any of those ideas, ive left them up for discussion so feel free to offer your ideas! Hope to hear from you soon

I've had these feelings since early childhood but only started acting on them around the age of 12 (secretly crossdressing in my sister's clothes and praying to god I would wake up a girl). I used to be able to mostly ignore it and push it down in my thoughts but recently it's become a never ending fantasy in my mind. I throw myself into countless transgender posts and even pornography just to alleviate the thoughts but it's just pushing my mind more towards transition with each passing day. I'm scared. I feel alone in this. I have a very close relationship to my family but a large portion of them are extremely Catholic (especially my parents). I'm stuck at a crossroads where I feel I have to decide whether to say fuck it and risk my relationships or continue in the life I have now where I obsess silently over what I could be. I feel lost and misunderstood by my family and peers. I wish I could tell them but I have too much fear of what they might think. I don't know what to do but I feel as if I'll just regret it immensely if I just continue to push down my feelings do nothing.  "

He's a junior, studying computer science major (so kind of geeky). He has been tirelessly looking for who love and an internship but to no avail. He's smart, an excellent student, and has only occasional luck with women. Aesthetically, he's fine, perhaps even attractive, but due to his inability to find proficient work and any long term relationship he may think that he has some kind of physical deformity. We shared an average childhood, nothing to out of the ordinary and our relationship has always been close and intimate but nothing ever resembling sexual. After texting and talking to you continually, I have been confiding in you my various insecurities. Specifically, my declining mood, semi-suicidal thoughts, and delusional physical abnormality. You as well have shared your particular thoughts, emotions, and self-doubt. I'm hoping that the romance can occur somewhat naturally, with you strategically encourage where our romantic relationship leads. At first I may not be into it, so you may have to keep pushing me. We are currently living together and going about our lives in our parents house, so digression is somewhat key but not a complete partitive. Mom and dad own a lake house or some ocean front property beside our regular abode that they don't often visit and since we were are good kids, they let us come and go as we please.

94ia65,2,2018-08-04,Made a video about my channel making a change.,FutimaRS,NewTubers,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewTubers/comments/94ia65/made_a_video_about_my_channel_making_a_change/,"So I decided to upload a video about my channel changing from uploading guides on a single game to a variety of different games based on my mostly single game (Runescape 3) channel. What are your thoughts of me changing my channel? I have 1.3k Subs and built my channel on this game and am slowly losing interest in this game and I want to create different content. I'm very curious of what other content creators think of this. This is what I put under the video (lots of text):


If you have the time, please read this comment.
So I've pumped out most of the guides I ever created, achieved my ""ultimate goals"" in Runescape and I'm feeling a bit burned out from creating so much content in a short time period and I want to take a break from Runescape content after I upload my ""final"" guides.

Why?

I've felt this one coming for a long time and didn't expect my channel to grow as fast as it is growing right now. I want to thank every single one of you for this. I've enjoyed making the content, but felt as if I had to force out videos each day and this is also the reason why I stopped the ""Alt Adventures series"". I have also started to enjoy the game less because I've been playing it quite consistently for the past month. On top of that the bashing of Runescape 3 by OSRS &amp; RS3 players alike is annoying the f*ck out of me as this off-sets newer players from the game, and really demotivates me as a Runescape 3 youtuber, as the potential viewerbase for the game is slowly declining, but might be revived immensely when RS3 Mobile comes out.

The future of this channel

I've always uploaded a variety of games and still intend to do so as you might of seen some different types of games come through the channel like Subnautica &amp; For Honor for example. I intend to start making content on multiple games consisting of videos like:
- Quick start guides
- Game reviews
- Game guides (like the RS ones)
-  Possible let's plays
I've thought about making a second channel but I think it's better to make the content on this one instead of it just dying out or becoming inactive as I think it has more ""status"" with a small but decent subscriber foundation, as I hope you might understand.

The next few videos

The next few videos might consist of a few Runescape guides that I really think I need to make before I make the break, or none at all. If you have any suggestions right now just drop em down here and I might consider creating them. After that I will most likely start with a few Game reviews and once the Summer is over and my Internship starts my free time will become very scarce and the videos will decrease for a period in time. Around this period Dead Frontier II will release and I plan to make a lot of content on that game so if you're interested in that stay tuned.

Keep in mind

This isn't the end of Runescape content, i'll always come back and make videos eventually.

If any other content creator is reading this, please give me your opinion as a fellow content creator on what you think about my decision, as I'm eager to know what you have to say. Thank you.﻿

94ia9x,1,2018-08-04,Mental Health Awareness week - The Blue Tree Clinic,thebluetreeclinicuk,u_thebluetreeclinicuk,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_thebluetreeclinicuk/comments/94ia9x/mental_health_awareness_week_the_blue_tree_clinic/,"Mental Health Awareness Week 2018 (14th-20th May)

Blue Tree intern Maddy Lykourgos promotes Mental Health Awareness Week…

This year’s theme for Mental Health Awareness Week is stress and how we cope with it. Naturally, stress impacts our state of mind, mood, emotions and how we perceive the world. In other words, it majorly affects our mental health.

Essentially, we have good stress (eustress) and bad stress (distress). Both are natural responses adapted to release hormones that alert the rest of the body and mind that action must be taken. An example of the former would be something with a tangible goal, a challenging assignment that’s difficult but doable, or goal-oriented physical exercise. In this case, stress levels return to normal once the task has been completed. On the contrary, distress is harder to combat and diffuse; it often takes longer for the individual to recover, because the body remains vigilant against a potential and non-tangible worry. If this state persists it can lead one to withdraw, feel anxious and even depressed.

When we are experiencing stressful periods of time, our adrenal glands secrete more of hormones called cortisol, adrenaline, and norepinephrine. Cortisol is vital to regulating the metabolism, and adrenaline and norepinephrine produce a reaction to threat: the fight, flight or freeze response. However, in stressful situations, even when there is no immediate threat, our body mimics the fear response and these levels are maintained in excess amounts. This is because, without a threatening stimulus, we cannot respond directly to it – that is, we cannot fight, flee or freeze, and therefore, these levels remain high and we stay hypervigilant towards a threat that is not there. Sustained high levels of these hormones can interfere with learning and memory, lower the immune system and cause problems with physical health, such as increasing blood pressure, cholesterol and contributing to illnesses like heart disease.

Moreover, raised levels of hormones like cortisol can deplete the neurotransmitters serotonin and dopamine that regulate our mood. Therefore, stress is closely linked with depression and anxiety, because the physiological sensations we feel, such as racing heart rate and sweating, tell us there is something to worry about and something we have to be prepared for if we are to keep ourselves safe.

As it’s an evolutionary, and often involuntary, response to get stressed, it can feel like we have no control over it; so, a good way to combat stress is to change your perception of it. Negative situations can be awful to have to go through, but only by going through them do we learn that we’re strong enough to do so. It’s not so much that positive thinking will relieve every burden you have, but more a sense of recognizing that we are more resilient than we believe. We have constantly put in seemingly impossible situations and yet somehow we manage. It means we carry an arsenal of life experience that can get us through periods of stress, mostly because we have done so before.

What can The Blue Tree Clinic do to help?

We offer a range of treatments that can help reduce the harmful impact of stress. Approaches such as mindfulness can help with relaxation techniques, or CBT can aid in reframing some of the negative thoughts that may be helping to maintain the stress. Other talking therapies, such as counseling can help to ease the burden of stress on both our physical and mental health by talking through some of our stressors. In the meantime, it can be useful to make a list of specific problems that trigger your stress, and for those that you can do something about, write down a list of solutions; for those that you can’t do anything about, worrying about it is futile, so stop allowing it to get you down. It seems oversimplified, but distinguishing between problems you can and can’t solve allows us some extra time to schedule enjoyable and relaxing activities rather than avoiding these all together and allowing the stress to persist.

In the spirit of Mental Health Awareness Week, we urge anyone experiencing stress or anything else that is impacting their mental wellbeing to contact us now at The Blue Tree Clinic. Contact our friendly Private Therapist for a safe, comfortable conversation.

I instantly knew I could wanted to be different for her, and show her who I really was and I still didn't. She was from a small country town and was Mrs prom queen, star athlete, who has a 4.0 and plays college softball. I grew up in a big suburban town, and I play 2 college sports and I figured we'd be the perfect match. She constantly was immature and would say things to get a rise out of me or hurt me so when I kept my guard up for the year and a half of our relationship she would get upset that I'm not letting myself love her. I would get so frustrated and shut down and stop communicating and immaturely break up with her and she'd get so upset Everytime but I never knew how to get it through to her that I needed her to be more understanding. And fast forward a year and a half and she just left me one day, we had been doing long distance and she sent me a text ending things. And the last two months anytime i'd be okay and start to move on she'd text me or call me and then disappear for a week. I allowed her to keep doing that but it got to a point where she got nasty and I snapped and was done talking to her and then she tells me shes with someone new. She blames everything on me and is the only person I've ever met that makes me feel like everything is a me issue. I spend every day at my internship just thinking about her, and missing her and I genuinely don't know how to break the cycle. I've tried everything I always do to distract myself, talking to girls, hanging with friends, going golfing or throwing a bullpen. For fucks sake, I agreed to rent a house for my senior year of college at my school to be a whole hour closer to her and give us a place to get away and now I'm just gonna get another 6k in loans out of this; I'm a dumbass. She is the only thing on my mind and it's gotten worse since she left me. I feel so pathetic and weak, and I've never dealt with emotions like this before. This cycle of trying to convince myself that I'm okay, but I know I'm not and then I break down and just wanna call her is so mentally and physically exhausting. 


Tl;Dr Ex dumped me and I'm straight up lost. Not quite sure how to break this cycle. "

I'm already 25 years old and yet I don't feel at all like an adult. 

I went to my nearby commuter school, didn't join a frat, make friends, or studied a meaningful field until it was too late. 

My whole life I've been held back by religious fears of ""living"" my life and doing worldly things, but now that the time has passed I fully regret not being a kid. 

I've been job-hunting for a year now, and securing an internship has been difficult as they want students and not recent graduates. I've been told to apply to entry-level jobs, but the truth is that although I did study the field, I never had any experience to justify a skillset at an interview which is why I want an internship in the first place. 

I've been thinking about going back to school to get a degree in the field I want, and possibly live out the ""away from home"" out-of-state, room-mate, partying and making friends college life that I missed out on but then the anxiety creeps in: How would I afford it? How would I be able to relate to these college kids when I'm 5-7 years older than them even though I don't feel older. 

Ideally going back to college would allow me to live out the kid being away from the parent's phase many go through and ""grow"" and learn to be an individual while also allowing me to apply for internships due to actually being a student which would make things easier. I would be able to network when I didn't before, make friends, secure an internship and confidently apply for a real job after doing the internship and graduating with a better GPA opening the doors to better companies. 

But I feel so discouraged, not only is it an expensive endeavor but I also feel like I'm now too old and that I missed the boat on experiencing this. I dread having to settle for an unrelated job to get by, while my peers are getting married, having kids and starting their adult life in big cities with good careers. 

I feel left behind, and want to catch-up not only socially, but professionally too. I don't know what to do, a time machine would be wonderful but life isn't a movie. "

94kchz,4,2018-08-04,I [21F] feel like my boyfriend [21M] doesn't care about me while at his internship,concernedgf005,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/94kchz/i_21f_feel_like_my_boyfriend_21m_doesnt_care/,"My boyfriend and I have been together for over 2 years. This summer, he got an internship at a company across the country. However, a lot of things have happened during this time that have put a strain on our relationship.

First, he doesn't make time for me. We would schedule when we were going to FaceTime every day, and recently he's ditched last minute or sent me a text an hour before the planned time saying ""Can we talk now? I have plans later."" I want him to make friends and spend time with people, but I'm busy too and I need him to respect my time and our agreements. There's also a time difference which makes things more difficult, because if he goes and does something with other interns on a weekday it's super late for me when he gets back. At one point when I brought up the fact that he kept ditching our plans to talk, he basically said ""well I don't understand why we have to talk every day"" which made me really upset. 

Another issue: Who he's spending time with. The company he's working for provides apartments for the summer, and he just happens to live in a complex with only other female interns. This didn't really bother me, but he's been spending a lot of time with this one intern, we'll call her Katie. For the first month or so he'd do things with big groups of people, but recently he's started to hang out just with Katie too. Since they live nearby and go to a lot of the same intern events, they often carpool, so they see each other almost every day. A few days ago, he told me he was going to a concert downtown with some interns, but he wasn't sure exactly who was going. It turns out that it was just him and Katie going to the concert, which he told me afterwards. This made me uncomfortable. He said they're just friends, and it's not a big deal. I know they do other things by themselves, like go for walks around their apartment (he often neglects to tell me it was just him and Katie doing these things unless I ask specifically who was there). He also told me they're going to a basketball game by themselves next week.

As a side-note, I've flown up and visited him twice during this time. I went to some events with him, and he and Katie seemed really close -- they'd laugh at all each other's jokes and were always around each other. 

At one point, he said a group of interns were going swing dancing, and asked if he could go. I said I wouldn't be comfortable with him dancing with other women. He got upset with me for not letting him spend time with people (even though he sees these interns almost every day), but ultimately didn't go.

Recently, he had cancelled a few of our calls last minute, and I was pretty pissed. I asked him specifically when he'd be free the next day and told him not to make any plans because I needed to feel like I was a priority. He said he understood. Then, 15 minutes before we were actually supposed to talk, he called me. At first I thought he was just calling early, but he told me other interns were going to see a movie that he really wanted to go to, and that he was going. I started crying. I felt like he didn't care about me, didn't prioritize me, and didn't need me. I was begging him not to go so we could talk, but he said his ride was outside, and he had to go. I was still crying on the phone when he said ""I'm sorry but I have to go, I love you"" and hung up.

At this point, I don't really know what to do. I think he thinks I'm overreacting and keeping him from making friends. I feel that he doesn't care about me and don't like that he's spending so much time one on one with Katie. Thoughts?

TL;DR: My boyfriend keeps cancelling plans to talk to me so he can hang out with other people. He's spending time alone with one girl in particular which makes me uncomfortable. "
94kffh,6,2018-08-04,First time financing car with decent credit (740ish),RadiographicAdult,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/94kffh/first_time_financing_car_with_decent_credit_740ish/,"So I'm thinking of buying a used car in the ball park of 20-25k maybe and have enough money to pay like 30% of it down and a stable job to keep making payments for the rest of it.

I have like 6 credit cards total (I only use like 2-3  of them the rest have zero balances) that Ive been using for the past 3-4 years and always made my payments on time (never paid a single cent of interest ever) and a student loan on my credit history where I've already paid off about 20% of it (I'm still in college btw). This is my only credit history.

Somebody told me that no matter what or how good your credit score may, your first time getting a car loan you will have a high APR % simply because you've never had a car loan before.

Is this true or what? I wanted to get a car without my parents cosigning or helping me out (I already pay for my part of the family's auto insurance plan) but if my APR comes out to 10% I'd have to rethink that.

**Edit**: For all the people saying buying a car at this point will make me broke: I have money saved up, and I have a decent promised cash flow from my current job until I finish school and then I have an even higher paying job set up for me once I graduate. I've went over my financial strategy regarding expenses and budgets over the next year and I'm fine. I also live with my parents for now. I'm not financially illiterate.

**Edit2**: For all the people who read this and assume I'm ""overreaching"": I make **25$ an hour** at my current job while going to school and I live with my parents. My current student loan balance is about 7k (subsidized with 0 interest grace period after grad) and my monthly expenses for everything right now before the car is about $600-700 a month. I have enough money for a sizable down payment (30-40%) plus more money (couple thousand extra) in a different savings account for contingency and emergencies. I've been continuously working while going to school since I was 16 (I'm 23 right now) and am aware of how to manage a budget. Right now I make about 3200$ a month after taxes while working my internship full time during summer and when school starts I'll be working part-time (3 days a week) and making almost 2000$ per month after taxes for the entire senior year of college. Then I'll graduate and start my full time job after about 2 months of a summer break and make about $3500 a month after taxes and deductions while still living with my parents. I really didn't intend on bragging about my income while being a student (I didn't even know I would have to give out an entire budget of my monthly personal finances to justify this purchase) but the way people are reacting in the comments requires me to make the situation more clear."

first time poster here. I just received the best compliment i could ever hope for at a job interview yesterday. 

To give you an idea of my current situation, I'm a 21 year old university student living in Germany. Growing up with extremely conservative and religious parents, I've always been really shy and introverted. Never going out, never even celebrating my own birthday with friends, never had a girlfriend, you get the idea. 
I have always been great when it comes to school and academics in general, but socially i was a complete mess and really awkward. Had a lot of insecurities about my looks, always concerned with what others might be thinking about me. 

After i graduated from school I moved out to go to university in a city nearby. In my first year I was really feeling down. Again, I did great academically but i felt like I simply couldn't fit in. Sure, I had a couple of friends that I was hanging out with when I was at lectures or on campus, but that was it. I never learned how to maintain a friendship outside of my workplace (or even relationships in that sense)
Through extracurriculars I participated in a lot of projects and even had the opportunity to lead some really big teams. But I still felt like the same person. 

A year has passed and for a couple of months now, I've been looking for internships to get some experience in a really competitive field. After many rejected applications (20-30) at a point where I almost gave up applying I decided to go for one more round and submitted a couple more. Fast forward a couple of weeks later, I had a phone interview at a fortune 50 company and received an offer. I was ecstatic, but I had open invitations from a couple of other companies. I cancelled all except for one that was in Berlin, just because I haven't been around the country that much due to growing up relatively poor. 
A couple of weeks earlier, I started to talk to a girl again that I met 6 years ago online. At the time we were chatting for hours on end but didn't stay in touch after a while.

She is living in Berlin and we decided to finally meet up, but more about that later.
The interview was alright, while I did good on the personal fit questions I struggled a bit at the case study. But since I already accepted another position I didn't really care. However at the end of the interview, they decided to make me an offer on the spot. During their feedback they highly praised my professionalism and my social skills. I was really taken aback, because I wasn't expecting that at all. All those months where I participated in projects, worked in teams and went out of my comfort zone, I did change. A lot actually. Looking back now, I was a completely different person back then, but I just couldn't see it. My own negativity was the only thing that was holding me back. I spent the next 4 hours meeting up with the girl that I mentioned earlier (something that I never did before) and we had an absolute blast. I finally felt real happiness again in a long time. I even got the impression that she was interested in me beyond being just friends and she insisted that we meet up again. Even if I wasn't having any romantic feelings towards her (who knows, never really knew what that was like) I still felt like at the very least I finally found what I was looking for. 

I was even feeling more content with myself. A while ago I managed to lose some weight. While I still see myself as a slob, objectively speaking I'm considered to be average or thin now (still need to wrap my head around that idea). I also started to work on my wardrobe (shoutout to malefashionadvice) and maintain a well trimmed beard. The only compliment that I ever received in the past was that I'm smart. But now everyone started to complement me on my new looks and especially my beard. It feels amazing.

I don't know where Im going with this to be honest. I know that I still have a lot to learn and catch up on. But Im definitely going to enjoy this journey. 

And to all of you who struggle with social anxiety or a lack of confidence. What helped me was to just say fuck it and try new stuff and work on the things that I could actually change (weight, clothing, etc), it makes a huge difference. 

Good luck :)"

My plan is to do 2-3 internships (spring and sumer or placement preferably) before graduating as my aim is to work in the UK. I know it's kinda hard to go from a tier 4 - - &gt; tier 2 but I'll hope for the best. I hope for an internship in programming and developing as I'm very interested and fascinated by software and also hope to have a career in it.

What should I do to improve my cv/resume? As it's currently non existential.

I go to college in California, but I got an internship with a company in New York that I had been working with for the summer.

The internship ended two weeks before my semester started, so I decided to take a nice windy road trip across the country on my way back to California.

I must’ve been in Nevada somewhere when it happened. I have an old convertible and I was blasting music and driving fast, the late summer air whipping through my car. I had been driving for several hours though, so I was keeping an eye out for a place to stop and get a few hours of sleep.

I pulled off the highway and drove along a road, looking for a hotel. I’d been driving for almost 15 minutes along the road and had almost turned around when I came around a curve and saw a hotel. It looked like a traditional mexican pueblo hotel, that kind of architecture, you know? The kind of building that had a chapel built into it.

The place looked very nice, and very, very expensive. Still, I figured it’d be a nice change of pace from the crappy airbnb's that I’d been using. I pulled my car into the parking lot and walked into the building. I was surprised at how dark the inside of the hotel was; the only lights were coming from the welcome desk.

A man stood behind the desk wearing a bright red vest. He gave me a smile that was almost too wide. “Hello sir. How may I help you?”

I asked him what it would cost me to get a room for the night. He gave a small nod and said, “Our standard rooms go for 30 dollars, but you can upgrade to our master suite for 75 dollars.”

I was more than a little surprised at that. This place looked like it could’ve been a resort. Nice marbled floors, quality wood, the works. Still, I’m not one to pass up a good thing, so I asked for the master suite.

“Of course sir. Ms Garcia will lead you to your rooms.”

A young mexican woman stood in the door holding a candle that looked straight out last century. She stood, framed by its flickering light. “I will show you to your rooms,” she said in a flat low voice.

She led me down the hallway, passing rooms on either side. The woman spoke a little above a whisper as she walked. “You have access to free room service at any time of the day or night with your master suite sir. We can provide you with a wide selection of wines, foods, and desserts at no added cost. Please feel free to call at any time.”

We reached my room, and she handed me an old wrought iron key. I almost laughed at it. Was this hotel some kind of reenactment of how old hotels used to be? I used the key on my door and stepped inside. My room was huge with a canopy bed and a balcony that overlooked the outside.

“If you need anything from me, please just ring the bell,” she said, pointing to a string attached to the wall. “Would you like anything while I’m here?”

I thought for a moment, but shrugged. “Sure. I’ll take a glass of wine. What have you got?”

“There is an excellent Chateau that I would recommend. Would that suffice?”

“Uh, yeah. That’d be great.” I said.

She disappeared, returning in a moment with a tall glass. I took it and thanked her, and she disappeared back down the darkened hallway.

The wine was delicious, by far the best I’d ever had. I didn’t know what to think about this hotel, but I figured I’d just lucked out. I soon I was fast asleep on my bed.

It was several hours later when I was awoken by the voices. It sounded like they were coming from outside my door. It was hard to make out, but they were definitely singing. I only caught a few words, but I remember ‘lovely’, ‘room’, and ‘time of year’. There were dozens of voices.

As soon as I gathered my wits my reaction was to walk over to the wall and pull the bell. The bell tinkled softly in the night, and the voices stopped immediately. Within thirty seconds I heard a knock on the door. I approached it slowly, not knowing what to expect. My heart was pounding, and I cursed myself for leaving my pocket knife in my car.

I pulled the door open to see the small mexican woman from earlier. “How can I be of service sir?” she asked.

“I...uh… What were those voices I heard just now?” I asked.

Her eyes were emotionless. “Our guests,” she said.

“Right,” I said. “Well why don’t you bring me another bottle of that wine from earlier?”

“Which wine was that, sir?”

“The Chateau? I think that’s what you said.”

“You’ll have to see our front desk about that. I’m afraid we don’t carry that brand of wine here. Good night sir.” She strode off into the night.

I shut the door for a moment, thinking hard. This place was giving me a seriously bad vibe, and I wanted out. I grabbed my backpack and made my way down the dark hallway towards the front room. The same man from before stood behind the desk. “How can I help you sir?”

I didn’t want to talk to him, but I felt obligated to make the conversation as I made my way towards the exit. “I was served a glass of Chateau wine before bed, but then was told you don’t serve it here, so I think I’m just going to be leaving now.”

I turned towards the door and pushed. Instead of the glass and painted wood of the door, my hand felt the stucco of the wall. I realized that the old wooden door I’d walked through to enter was no longer there.

“I’m sorry to hear we couldn’t serve your tastes sir. You see, we haven’t carried that brand of wine here for close to three decades. You must have been mistaken.”

I turned around, confused. I must’ve gotten turned around. But no, this was the room. I scanned the walls, looking for the door, and saw nothing. “Gotcha. I must be a little confused. Where is the exit to this building?”

My eyes returned to his face. His smile unnaturally wide, stretching almost to his ears. His teeth were too long, and his hands were splayed on the counter. “Am I to understand you wish to check out sir?” he asked.

My mouth was dry, but I managed a nod.

The clerk shook his head savagely. “You may check out anytime you’d like sir, but you can never leave.”

My body flooded with adrenaline, and I did the only thing that came to mind. I ran back down the hallway towards my room, slamming and locking the door behind me. I tried my phone, but had no service.

I sat in that room for hours and hours. When I finally worked up the courage to try the door, I found it locked tight. My key did nothing.

As the hours passed my phone ran out of battery. A dozen hours must’ve gone by, but it was still dark outside.

I was exhausted.

Finally, I gave into my bodies demands and fell onto the bed, falling asleep almost immediately.

I woke up to the feeling of sunlight on my face. I coughed and sat up, covered in dust. I looked around and saw that I was in the middle of what looked like an abandoned building.

Wait.

It wasn’t just any abandoned building, I was still in my room. Just a version of my rooms that had been left to rot for a few decades. I jumped to my feet and tried the door. It had rusted, but swung open after a few kicks. The entire hotel looked like it had been abandoned the same as my room.

The lobby was the same, but I breathed a sigh of relief when I saw the desk was empty, and an even bigger sigh when I saw the door was there. My car was sitting outside, same as it had been the night before.

I hopped into it, and drove away.

If you want my advice, never stop by random hotels while on your way to California."

Out of reflex my hand shot out, fumbling to turn off an alarm.  It took me a few moments to realize that it was way too early for my alarm and someone was trying to call me.  I blinked blearily at the screen, seeing my brother’s name in blurry letters at the top.  Eventually I remembered how to use my hands and swiped the screen to answer.

“Hello?” I croaked, my voice not yet ready for the day.

“Hey Jay, I know it’s early, but I was just wondering if maybe you could run over to Mom and Dad’s place this morning? Like as soon as you can. I would do it myself but that’s obviously out of the question.”

I sat up a little, trying to wake up my brain.  Last night I had stared at the ceiling for probably four hours, trying to calm my thoughts, trying to find some sleep.  The clock now read 6:10 and I realized I had been asleep for less than three hours.  My head seemed to be vibrating with pain.

“Jay?” he asked after a few moments of silence as I realized I hadn’t answered him.

“Uh yeah, I’m here. You want me to go to Mom and Dad’s? Is everything okay?”

“Well… I’m not really sure.  That’s kind of why I want you to go over there.”

“What’s going on?”
“Well, I spoke to Dad on the phone last night, and he says there is something going on with Mom.  She has been acting really strange lately, and yesterday while driving home from work, she got completely lost and was pulled over and couldn’t tell the cop anything.  Her name, her address.  She could barely talk to him at all.  The cop sent her to the hospital, but Mom refused to cooperate and left before the doctor could even see her.  So Dad said he was going to keep a good eye on her last night and would call me in the morning, but I’m just worried and I know it’s not a far drive for you… I guess I just need a little peace of mind about this.  I’m really worried about it.”

I sat up straight in bed, processing all this new information.  At first I was a little hurt that no one thought to call me last night but I quickly moved on to feeling worried myself.  Mom had the best memory of anyone I had ever met.  She could recite every name of every kid I went to preschool with at the drop of a hat if I asked her to.  She never forgot anything. 

“Yeah, don’t worry about it, Sam.  I’ll get up right now and head over there.  I’ll call as soon as I can to let you know what’s happening.”

“Thanks, Jay.  I really appreciate it. Talk soon.” 

	
The sun was blinding as I headed out onto the freeway, and I felt like I had a hangover despite not drinking anything in weeks.  It was about a forty minute drive to my parent’s house and I knew it would be rough.  Last minute I had decided to bring Lucy with me, and she lay in the passenger seat happily snoozing, the sunshine baking into her dark brown fur.  She was a huge dog, but when she curled up into a tight ball, you would never know it.  I never understood how she fit all of her body into such a tight circle.

The drive went by unbelievably slowly.  There was very little traffic because most normal people wouldn’t be up for a few hours yet.  Saturdays really are meant for sleeping in.  I played a podcast on my phone to keep myself awake and focused on the road, my YETI jiggled in the cupholder next to me, half filled with hastily made burnt coffee.  There was something about the sun shining in my face that made me want to vomit.

Mom and Dad lived on a sleepy street in the quietest of small towns that seemed to belong somewhere in Connecticut but instead found itself less than an hour from Denver.  There were no other cars out as I drove through town, and the only business that seemed to be open was the old diner, though even their parking lot seemed especially bare.  A couple of squirrels were fighting over an acorn in the middle of the street in front of me so I slowed, waiting for them to see me.  Lucy sat to attention, her loud bark making them scurry away.  I patted her ears, her large tail whacking against the seat back.

As I pulled onto the street I grew up on, I instantly started to feel calmer; the throbbing in my head becoming noticeably duller.  There was always something about coming home, knowing I was always welcome, that could make any situation seem brighter.  Dad’s old green truck sat in front of the house and I pulled my junky old sedan up behind it.

When I opened the car door, Lucy leapt over me, out the door and up towards the house.  By the time I had climbed out she was already waiting for me at the front door, her tail wagging uncontrollably.  Lucy loved her grandparents because they spoiled her, giving her treats and new toys behind my back.  Naturally this was one of her favorite places to visit.  It was part of the reason I decided to bring her.  As much as Lucy loved them, my parents loved her even more, treating her like an actual grandchild since they were yet to get any real ones.

After getting Lucy to calm down slightly, I tried the knob but found that it was locked. I had a key to open it, but I couldn’t even remember the last time they locked their door.  People here just didn’t worry about things like that.  I searched my key ring for the barely used key, finding it just as Lucy started losing her patience with me.  She whined at my feet, eager to get inside.  As soon as the lock clicked and the door started to creak open, I could tell something was wrong.  The air inside was stale, like no one had been breathing it for at least a few days.  Lucy bounded in, rushing up the stairs to go find them, but I entered slowly, the uneasy feeling growing.

The TV was off, and there was no one bustling around in the kitchen, no smell of coffee brewing or of bacon sizzling.  None of the normal Saturday morning things that I expected to find.  I could hear Lucy’s paws padding around upstairs, it sounded like she was walking room to room, clearly unable to find them where she thought they should be.  She seemed to be slowly realizing the thing I had known as soon as we entered the house.  No one was here.  Lucy slowly made her way back down the stairs, her tail still, and looked up at me with sad eyes.  I set my purse on the table and did a quick walk of the house, double checking that we were alone, and that nothing was out of the ordinary.  Everything was exactly as is should be, except Mom and Dad were nowhere to be found.  I looked into the garage to find that Mom’s car was also missing.

Lucy was waiting for me on the couch when I came back in.  I sat down next to her and grabbed my phone to tell Sam about this new development.  He picked up after the first ring. Clearly he had been anticipating my call.

“Jay! Any news?” he said frantically.  I took a deep breath before answering.

“They aren’t here,” I said exhaling slowly.

He was silent for a moment.  “What do you mean? Where are they?”

“I don’t know.  There is no one here and Mom’s car is gone.”

I could hear him taking rapid breaths, something he always did when a new problem presented itself to him.  After a few moments he seemed to calm down.  “Okay, here’s what we will do. I’ll call every hospital they could have gone to.  You try calling their cell phones and if they don’t answer, look around town for Mom’s car or ask around if anyone has seen them.  They have to be there somewhere.”

I said I would and we hung up, agreeing to talk in one hour or sooner if either of us heard anything.  Immediately, I called Mom’s phone and then Dad’s.  Mom’s was off which was usually the case.  She hated cell phones and only had one in case of emergencies, but as it went straight to voicemail, I stopped myself from wondering if this may actually be an emergency.  Quickly I left a message urging her to call me as soon as she could.  Dad’s phone was on but just rang for far too long, and an automated voice informed me his voicemail box was full.

Lucy looked up at me with concern and I realized I had started to cry.  She laid her head gently in my lap, and I stroked it absentmindedly, letting the silence of the house and the softness of the couch envelope me.  Where could they have gone?  It was not like them at all to disappear like this especially after such a strange thing happened.  Sam had told me to ask around town but I couldn’t bring myself to leave the comfort of the house where everything was still okay; where I knew I wouldn’t find out anything I wasn’t ready to know.

After a while I decided I had to do something instead of just wait for Sam to call back.  I made my way back upstairs into Mom’s office.  Everything was very neat and orderly like always.  Her laptop sat closed in the middle of the desk, papers were lined up perfectly in an organizer, pencils and pens were arranged by color and size in a metal cup, and a picture of Lucy sat off to the side in a light blue frame.  I pulled out the chair and sat down, letting myself sink into the soft fabric, the smell of Mom’s signature flowery perfume lingered on everything around me.  I felt another well of tears start to come up my throat but swallowed hard to keep them at bay.

The paper organizer held nothing of interest, just bills that needed to be paid, forms to sign up for a 5k, a few credit card offers, and a letter from her sister.  I tried the computer next.  I opened it up to a prompting me to enter a password.  She had been using the same password for the past ten years for everything.  Back then I had helped her set up an email account and told her to pick something that she would always remember.  She thought for a minute but eventually chose neworleans1986 with a smile.  Her and Dad had met at the Super Bowl that year.  She was working there as an intern for an events company and Dad had won tickets from a radio contest.  They got to talking while waiting in line to buy food during intermission and realized they were both originally from Colorado and decided to meet up there a few months later when Mom’s internship ended.

I typed it in but the computer told me it was incorrect. I tried it again thinking maybe I had mistyped it, but still received the same message.  She had changed her password.  For some reason this worried me more than anything else had.  Mom wasn’t really a creature of change, especially when it came to technology.  I stared at the screen, a blurry family photo of all four of us in the background, obscured until I could provide the right combination of letters and numbers.  I tried a few other things including their wedding anniversary, Sam’s birthday, my birthday, Lucy’s birthday, all other significant days in my mom’s life but still I was locked out.  Sighing deeply, I placed my head in my hands.  Lucy was laying on the floor at my feet and I could tell she felt a little uneasy as well.

My phone buzzed in my pocket.  I pulled it out to find a text from Sam.  “I know it’s only been a half hour, but I’m really freaking out Janie.  They haven’t checked in at any hospitals around there.  Have you heard anything?”

Sam never called me Janie; he knew how much I hated it. He was much more worried than I had thought he was.  I texted back a quick reply telling him I had left a voicemail but hadn’t figured anything else out yet.  I could feel my headache returning.  This was not how I had envisioned spending my Saturday.

Lucy and I headed back downstairs after I had tried a few more passwords to no avail.  I grabbed my purse and turned to leave but remembered something before I got to the door.  Walking into the kitchen I couldn’t help but hold my breath, praying that this could give me some kind of clue.  

The drawer in the kitchen island had always been a junk drawer when we were kids but after Sam and I had moved out, Mom claimed it as her own, throwing away all those old rubber bands, dead batteries, and sticky Chinese takeout menus.  She replaced them with recipe cards organized in a small binder, small knock off Scentsy squares, and her day planner.  Everyday she took her planner from the drawer, checked her schedule for the day, and put it in her purse, and every night she would write her next day’s plan before going to bed and place it back in the drawer.  I always thought it was weird, but she liked having a specific place to put it when she was at home that was more convenient than leaving it in her office upstairs.  

I walked to the drawer, the brass handle was dull from use.  Slowly I pulled it open, afraid to look inside, afraid that it would be empty.  Inside the drawer not only did I find her day planner, but also her cell phone.  I pulled both out, setting them on the counter, taking a deep breath.  The phone I turned on immediately, but since it was such an old model, it took a while to boot up.  While I was waiting I flipped open the planner.  The bookmarked page was two weeks ago, which didn’t seem right because she used this thing every day.  That week was filled out like normal with work meetings, book club, a dentist appointment, but the next two weeks including this week were entirely blank.  I stared at the empty boxes, trying to make sense of something that wasn’t there.  After a minute of so, I continued flipping.  Next week was also blank, but the week after that was back to normal.  While not a lot had been written down, a few meetings were there as well as a baby shower for a friend’s daughter.  

I sat there for awhile trying to understand what this meant.  Three weeks of nothing but then everything would seemingly go back to normal.  It didn’t make any sense, especially for someone who was so anal about using their planner every day.

The phone was finally up and ready so I swiped the screen to get to the home page.  Thankfully her phone wasn’t password protected.  Everything looked normal.  The background was a picture of Dad and Lucy from a few months before when they dogsat for me and took her on a hike.  She said it was one of her favorite pictures of Dad, who wasn’t really up for being the center of attention very often.  I scrolled through a few pictures but nothing was out of the ordinary there, checked her scarcely used Facebook for weird messages or posts, and finally scanned her messages for anything that would make this situation make sense.  There were texts from Dad, me and Sam about various mundane things, including more urgent texts from Sam since last night.  A few friends from the neighborhood and book club filled out the rest of the screen.  

I set the phone down again, sighing, upset that I couldn’t get any new information from two things that should have told me everything.  My own phone buzzed in my purse; another text from Sam.  I was getting ready to respond with what I had just found when Lucy started to whimper like crazy.  She wasn’t one to get upset easily so I knew something was wrong.  I knelt down to her, stroking her head trying to calm her down but she wouldn’t stop.  Suddenly more buzzing came from the island above me.  I stood up to grab my phone, figuring Sam was calling me but when I got back up I realized it wasn’t my phone, it was my mom’s.  I picked it up quickly, looking at the screen and immediately I felt a chill run up my spine.  It was my dad.

94mqha,7,2018-08-04,My boyfriend says he loves me but it feels like he does not want me?,ethiopianblogger,love,https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/94mqha/my_boyfriend_says_he_loves_me_but_it_feels_like/,"I've been dating this really great guy for about a year. We've had soooo many up's and downs. I have severe anxiety and depression from being abused and anemic. It's been really hard but he's been with me through every episode and I love him so much for not giving up on me. 

Well, last year my father, who his textbook narcissistic and abusive, cut my allowance significantly. I lived pretty far from campus and have to drive, so gas was a huge problem and so were groceries. My boyfriend helped me out financially and just cooked for the both of us and I would drive us to school everyday. It was working out. 

But, slowly I started to notice that my boyfriend didn't really try to do anything romantic. Once in awhile he'll say cute things like how much he loves me and how when he hears certain songs they remind him of me and I love all that. But, physically he didn't really show it. He stopped putting his hands around my waist as much, stopped holding my hand, less compliments, etc. I've never really received any cute gifts tbh. 

Recently, his ex-girlfriend followed and unfollowed me on instagram (weirddd). They don't follow each other, but I noticed she still had pictures of him on her feed and he still kept them tagged on his account. He looked so much happier w her than he has ever been with me and it's just such an ugly feeling. I remember when we first started dating and we talked about ex's and he mentioned that he went out of his way for this girl. He made 100 origami cranes with each one saying what he loved about her, he would go down to her university to visit her on his free time. They had a fuckin book where they wrote a fantasy love story that was parallel to their relationship. I wasn't expecting him to do all this when we got together but it was amazing to hear he had a romantic bone in his body and would possibly do things to express his appreciation of me. Small gestures like flowers would actually make my heart explode, but he's never once done that. 

We talked about this, too. I didn't mention his ex cause I hate bringing old pasts back. I asked why he wasn't romantic with me and he said it was because he helped me financially, so he thought that was enough? That actually broke my heart. If I had known that paying for my groceries was the peak of his gestures I would not have asked for a penny. When my dad cut our grocery spending in high school, I was eating less than 1000 cals/day. I lost 30 pounds. But, I was still doing well. A little bit of hunger would not have bothered me so much. I unknowingly sacrificed a whole year of potential romance with my boyfriend for some groceries? 

Anyway, this summer I am back home and actually back to my starving ways lol and my boyfriend is off at his internship. I have not asked for anything/money whatsoever in hopes that my boyfriend would realize he has room to actually do romantic/affectionate things. He can send a postcard or get someone else to deliver flowers, just anything, facetime me when he is on break, literally anything that is remotely cute. It's been 2 months and he has not done anything. Barely texts or calls me. He'll definitely call me when he gets home from hanging out with his new friends, it will be like 11pm/12am, and he falls asleep quickkk. It feels like we are just friends.

Every time I mention how unromantic he is, he panics and begs me to not break him up with him and that he actually loves me so much and he's simply bad at expressing how much he appreciates me. I feel trapped. It seems like he loves me but doesn't actually want me. I do love him but theres also this sense of detachment that I am experiencing. Like, now I feel weird expressing any romance because he physically does not show it anymore. It feels like we are friends.

I don't want to break up immediately because he only has one month left in his internship and maybe things could be different if we're together. but for the next month what should I do? pretend everything is fine until he gets back? Or keep trying to fix it now? Thank you for any responses and I apologize for the long read lol."

Smoking history: social tobacco smoker in high school, last smoked 2008


Medications: Oral Contraceptive Loryna 3 -.0.02MG (estrogen/progesterone). Been on similar medication since about 14 yrs old.


Current Complaint:

I had been having what I suspected were gastric ulcers (intermittent pain/discomfort especially after eating, nausea) for about 2 years, which I mentioned to my doc at a visit in June. During that time I was going through my internship and the stress of a new job so I didn't think much of it. She wanted to be thorough and submitted bloodwork (CBC/Chem, H. pylori titer) and sent me for an abdominal ultrasound. 

Bloodwork found mildly elevated alk phos but that was it, negative for H. pylori. 

On ultrasound they found a mass in my right liver lobe that they suspected to be Focal Nodular Hepatic Hyperplasia, but because of its size, they sent me for an MRI to confirm. MRI with contrast was inconclusive for the mass type, but the mass measured 16cm x 13cm x 7cm. The radiologist recommended a biopsy to rule out Fibrolamellar Hepatocellular Carcinoma and a Gastroenterologist agreed that he would like to do a biopsy. 


Main Differential Diagnoses: Hepatocellular Adenoma, Focal Nodular Hepatic Hyperplasia, Fibrolamellar Hepatocellular Carcinoma


I have several questions the Gastroenterologist was unable to answer.

1) I have now read several review articles that state if the mass is &gt;5cm they recommend skipping a biopsy and going straight to surgical excision. This is due to the high risk of hemorrhage and tract seeding. As well lesions this size seem to have a high likelihood of turning malignant, so better to just take it out than mess around with biopsies. 
Is there new research I am missing that is leading the gastroenterologist and radiologist to suggest going through a biopsy first? 

2) Research shows at least for the hepatic adenoma I should go off oral contraceptives. Can I switch to a hormonal IUD (like the Mirena one) to continue keeping PCOS at bay? Or no hormones whatsoever?

3) If it is a hepatic adenoma, obviously no pregnancy while I have the mass for risk of hemorrhage. If it is removed through surgery or regresses after going off oral contraceptives, do I have an increased risk for a new mass if I were to become pregnant in a few years?

Thank you in advance, I plan to attempt to schedule a second opinion with a new specialist on Monday as I am not super happy with my current one. I also need to decide soon whether to go ahead with the biopsy or not. With the physicality and remoteness of my work I worry about this mass rupturing before it is removed or regresses...Hoping for any and all input. I apologize for not posting any images but I am still waiting on the hospital to send me copies.

As always, thanks for reading.*

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

*Next time.*

Those were ominous words, weren't they? It's the type of saying a villain would use after they escaped their enemy. They were filled with revenge and foreboding, and Mina couldn't quite shake them because when would the next time be?

It wasn't as if they had worked out when was acceptable to vulnerably strip down and please each other. It wasn't like she had actually pleased anyone in a very long time.

Daniel was a very hard man to please. It wasn't like him to be caught in the office so routinely, but backlash from his editor, Laney, cause him to stalk the firm, sitting in the chair with his hands behind his head and elbows bent, arguing for a pitch. He didn't really have to argue, the company was half his. Half his brothers. Even so, they were under a large umbrella company, and after a few days Mina was positive he wanted to bend that umbrella over his knee and chuck it off their back deck into the ocean. 

It made *next time* seem inevitably distant, which only seemed to encourage her fantasies as the days slipped by. In them she was often at his mercy, hands bound and legs spread. In them she always looked better, a flatter stomach, shaplier breasts, a freshly bare sex for him to to feast upon.

It caused her to dredge up older fantasies of them, from when they had first met and she wondered how it would feel to have him pressed into her as they covered gasps with fierce kisses in a very public setting. How it would have been to have him kiss her. Take her.

Now she knew how his lips moved over hers. The reality was much, much better compared to her concocted dreams. Potent enough, a shiver raced along her spine and she had to set the manuscript down to uncloud her mind. Only she got stuck part way between reality and fantasy, eyes glazed over and lower lip sucked into her mouth.

Startled when the door swung open she slapped the papers up to hide her face as Daniel huffed, “Perspectives meeting, conference room, let's go.”

“Okay, boss,” she said without thinking and then the entire walk across the bullpen she thought on what she had just said. 

He was her boss, her employer. It was a technicality but it shown on paper and she felt a harsh blush reveal itself on her cheeks as she took a seat with a host of other editors, including Daniel's, who she sat beside.

The woman passed her a summary of the plot for Daniel's fourth book in a series and she held it up to hide her face. She had already read over this sheet several times at home, but reading it again grounded her enough to focus when Laney called the meeting to order.

“So, everyone's read through this, what is missing?”

“A comma in sentence three.”

“A better title.”

“Rip me to shreds people, god.” Daniel joked and cast his steely gaze around the room. “Laney thinks romance is missing between the captain and his once prisoner. This is a man who killed her brother in book one, took her hostage, and blew up the capital building on her planet.”

“Point made,” Laney argued. “This is also the man who saved her ass from becoming an experiment at the hands of her father *and* brother. And she is the woman who gave up her title and broke the most wanted criminals from prison, and then held a gun to her own father's head. Plus they flirt.”

Daniel shrugged, “So, we flirt.” He gestured to Mina making her face turn from crimson to pale in an instant as she floundered, realizing now would be a very bad time to reveal what else they had been doing.

“Leave me out of this,” she tried to smile and dismiss the comment.

“You're a sitting duck,” he argued, “Look, we live together. We've seen our rounds of tension. I'm no nearer falling for her than I am the next stranger who walks through these doors.”

“But the fans want a romance. The polls don't lie.

Can't you talk some sense into him,” Laney flagrantly asked Mina, “You do live with him.”

“My point exactly. I am no less wrapped around her finger because I live with her than Cassius is to Mercy and they have been living in the busted down hovel in space for the last three books. This isn't a romance, they are taking down an unfair, unregulated military enterprise. Let the fans have their fiction, romance would spoil the series. Plus Cassius dies.”

The room broke out into an intense bout of exchanges, arguing over his proclamation - one she new from the very beginning. His eyes went to hers and he gave her a wink. She swore the world could see.

Laney let out a defeated sigh. “Can you at least have them fuck each other?”

Mina had to look away then, unable to see the concentrated smugness on Daniel's face as he simply said, “Maybe. You'll have to wait to find out. Adjourned.”

The crowd dispersed, Laney calling after them - especially the interns - that no one was to let a peep out about Cassius’ death. Mina had known for years without saying a word, but she had a few for Daniel when she found him in her office, lounging in her office chair. 

She was quick to close the door and frown. “Why did you have to pull me into it!”

“You're the one who told me to kill off Cassius because it gave the story a better arc.”

“Not that, you complete ass. About flirting with me,” She hissed, leaning over the table to hound him with her eyes.

“I do flirt with you.”

“No you don't, you torment me.” 

Daniel gave her a half pout, his hand sliding over her, fingers crawling up her arm like vines. “Do I torment you?”

“Yes.” She swallowed deeply, mind far from the meeting and back to the daydreamy place she'd been floating.

“Good.” He spun to face her, giving her arm a tug so she drew near. “You've been torturing me too.” 

“Have I?”

His hands moved up her arm, boldly across her breast, wrapping lightly around her throat for an instant. She gasped and he took advantage of her parted lips, popping his thumb in her mouth.

Mina knew he hadn't found release, at least not through her, so when she sucked on his finger she gave him a little show, questioning where the boldness had come from. It was rewarded by a low groan as she took his whole thumb into her mouth before releasing it with a little nibble.

“Not at work,” she said quickly and moved away from him. “You're technically my boss. I think this breaks some sort of rule.”

“And you love the rules.” There was mischief in his eyes. “I have a few rules for you.”

Her throat went dry, his words had a pull on her even more roughly than hands. That timber, it made her panties intently begin to grow damp “What are they?”

“Rule one, look at me.”

Mina turned and looked, her nipples hardening until he could see them strain against the thin pink of her blouse. She wondered how she looked to him, was it as good as he made her feel? 

“Rule two, come here.”

Mina stood before him.

“Rule three, get on your knees.”

She folded her body, skirt riding up as her knees hit the floor with a full thud. The sound her heart made echoed in her ears as she looked eagerly up at him with dark and questioning eyes.

“What if we get caught?”

“You think I want to get caught, it would discredit my whole argument then I'd lose a battle and have to restructure the last two books.” As he spoke his hand caressed her face, the thumb she had sucked moving across her plump lips.

There was no thinking of fantasy then, the reality too raw as her hands went to his thighs and worked up the material of his jeans until she found his erection straining.

“I didn't lock the door.” 

“Then we better not make too much noise.”

She had already given in despite her argument, addicted to the way Daniel looked at her expectantly. No one had in far too long? Or had he always?

Her hand went to the buttons and zipper. He was wearing tight boxer briefs, the length of him pressed into the material, a shadow of the real thing she had seen not too long ago.

Preferring to expose him fully, hard cock and balls, she peeled down the elastic and he lifted himself enough she could tug the material until full access was granted. She watched as she took his cock in her hand for the first time, memorizing how it felt from curved shaft to swollen head. 

They had only been in her room for minutes and already he was leaking precum. How long had he been thinking of doing this? Since their kitchen encounter?

Mina had always enjoy sucking cock, rarely the opportunity arose for her so when she saw the glistening moisture she didn't want to waste it on her fingers. Wrapping a hand around the base she heard his soft grunt and his their eyes met.

She knew just how to get to him. She always had.

Her mouth moved toward his shaft, lips nearly brushing the skin as her breath washed over him. “Rule four. Tell me rule four.”

The hand that had been softly caressing her wove into her hair, gripping it. He rumbled, “Rule four….suck my cock, Mina.”

The flat of her tongue lapped against the bead of precum. Then again, starting down the length and working up. She pressed just hard enough against the underside to draw a noise from deep in Daniel's throat, before she slid her lips over the moistened head.

One hand was still at the base, her other dug into his thigh for balance as she began to work down his length in teasing tastes, tongue doing most of the work. She felt him grow stiffer and rewarded that by adding suction and a soft moan of her own. 

She wasn't thinking about decorum, other than keeping things muffled. Her attention was directed to the stiff cock she had in her mouth. She pushed saliva out from under her lips, until he was coated as far as she could take him. Only then did she sweep the hand around his thickness up, gathering the lubricant she had provided and began to work him with her hand paired with her mouth.

The effect was gratifying. The hand in her hair seized and she noticed how his knuckles went white on the hand gripping the arm of her chair. His dampened grunts mingled with the sloppy sounds of her mouth.

Her whole body moved as her lips parted over his cock, the suction greater as she pulled away, hungry for him. Part of her assumed he would have been more forcefully. Part of her might have even hoped. 

Part of her knew she would take him again in her mouth at their house when she didn't have an office filled with people ready to witness more than they bargained for - she couldn't believe he had so easily gotten her on her knees. 

Willingly she tried to take him just that much deeper, relaxing her jaw and flattening on her her tongue so the swollen head of his cock hit back of her throat. Lips met her curled fingers and she kept him deep, groaning as she did to add to the height of the moment.

“Fuck….” He hissed, lips contorted as he forced himself to play by her unspoken rule for near silence. “Rule five, look at me as I cum.”

Knowing he was close she sped up, bringing the tight ring of her mouth up and down his shaft with exaggerated strokes and dizzying speed. It was hard to focus on his face, but Mina never drew her gaze from his.

His nostrils flared and body shifted, hips moving as she felt his cock twitch in her mouth. She pulled up quickly as the first shot of his cum released, letting it pool as her tongue worked the sensitive underside of his head. 

He broke just slightly as she did, letting out one cracked groan like a shot fired, his hand as hard as she craved on the back of her head, keeping her steady as he finished, blue eyes attached to hers. There was a new tension between them, the kind that formed only during intimacy. It made her breathless.

Gulping, she swallowed his seed. He released her and she sat back on aching legs, licking at her swollen lips. 

Her voice was shaky as reality came back to her, acutely aware to how she had made a mess of her panties and how badly she wanted his fingers to slip the material to the side. Wanting this badly was reckless. What a fool she had been, losing control in her safe space for the merciless man before her. 

Panting, she turned on him. “Rule six, pull up your pants and get out of my office.”

He nodded, not daring to speak or maybe there was just nothing to say that would make any sense. Instead, Daniel held his hand out for her and aided her onto wobbly legs before he tucked his softening cock into his boxers and fascnented his trousers.

Mina was quick to remove her hand from his, leaning against the desk as she pretended to be fascinated by the clutter instead of how he slowly crept to the door like a naughty boy having been caught stealing cookies. They could have been caught!

Instead she caught that he had restructured a sequence in the manuscript she had been working on, his changes in blue ink and initialed. Quickly she threw a pen at him. 

“You do not just come in my office and correct my corrections! Out, get out!” 

He made haste of the handle as he thrust the door open, the moment of tension seeming to slip into something more bearable between them as her intern bustled past the open door and frantically said, “Ms. Abbott, are you alright?” And more reverently, “Mr. Reed?”

“All good,” Daniel kept laughing. “Just a little light flirting she couldn't handle.”

He departed and this time she did chase him into the bullpen, yelling curses to his back until he was gone, the whole time aching to let every dirty word she knew leave her mouth as he thrust into her.

Next time, she was going to know how it felt to come undone around his cock. "

94nigx,1,2018-08-04,2011 Toyota Corolla vs 2000 4Runner,TheChadmania,4Runner,https://www.reddit.com/r/4Runner/comments/94nigx/2011_toyota_corolla_vs_2000_4runner/,"So I'm kinda on the fence here.

Current situation: I have a 2011 Toyota Corolla, bought new off the lot in 2011, been in the family since, I've been driving it for 4 years now and it's got like 121,000 miles on it. I love it but it was my first car and I'm starting to outgrow it.

I do a lot of rock climbing and camping and I just want a vehicle for some weekend getaways from school. I'm in college and have a decent part time job at a coffee shop and hopefully I'll start some internships that pay a little more and are career oriented. Real talk means I'm kinda broke.

My plan is to sell/trade in the Corolla for a 2000 4Runner with ~150,000 miles on it. My reasoning is that with the places I take the Corolla now and with the engine that's in that thing, a 2000 4Runner would probably last longer than the rolla will. On top of that, once I graduate in about a year and a half and I get a real job that pays an actual salary, I can just get a used hybrid commuter car with good mpg because the rolla only gets like ~28mpg anyways. So if I waited till I got a job to get the 4Runner or similar fun car I'll be stuck with a shittier commuter car then just getting the 4Runner now.

So my real question of all of this is about the pure reliability. Obviously it depends a lot on how well kept the previous owners kept it, and how many miles in a city/freeway driving, and similar things but overall, if I buy a 2000 4Runner with ~150,000 miles and have like $1-2k left over from selling the rolla to get a good tune-up and replace any worn parts, can I expect some solid reliability from it over the next year and a half? What would you do if you wanted to just have a college fun car but already have a somewhat practical commuter car?

P.s. I'm going for the 2.7L 4cyl, RWD, automatic, baby 4Runner. I'm okay with the hit to my mpg but dropping below an average of ~20 would hurt.

P.p.s I would definitely plan on keeping it as my fun car or maybe trading up to a 4wd v6 version but I'd stay with a 3rd gen 4Runner for sure."
94nrch,3,2018-08-04,I'm so angry with God,majsue,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/94nrch/im_so_angry_with_god/,"I guess this is kind of a rant. So feel free to delete if it's inappropriate but I feel like I need to let this out somewhere.

I graduated college back in December and still haven't had success landing a job. I've had so many interviews, to places I want to work at and places that I don't and literally nothing has come about. This made me feel like a failure and inadequate. I'm getting pressure from everyone on why I don't have a job yet. I feel like I'm trying so hard but I'm just not good enough. Things start to look up when I find out that the place I held an internship at last year is hiring for my dream job. So I apply (3 weeks ago). I get the phone interview and I feel it goes great. The hiring manager tells me that she'll call around 2 weeks to let me know if I made it to the second round of interviews. 

I pray, not even exaggerating, almost every hour. When I would wake up in the middle of the night, I would get on my knees and pray. I truly believed that God opened this position for me and everything would be made right again. I've been struggling financially for some months bc I've gotten sick and also needed oral surgery. My family is starting to struggle financially and I'd love to be able to help my dad instead of being another burden. 

Last night I got an email that they found their final candidates to move forward to the next round and I was not one of them. It literally broke my heart in a way that I never felt before. I trusted God and he didn't even try to help me after I literally BEGGED him. I read his word and I saw things like ""Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours"". ""For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened."" And it's all lies. That's how I feel right now.

In my biggest time of need, God has just left me all alone. 

How can I worship a God like that? A God that hasn't helped me since I've been asking in December and still won't answer my prayers. Instead he teases me with having an opening at my dream organization/job and then takes it away after he tells me to ""believe and it'll be mine"". I am so angry and hurt. I've never felt a pain like this. I feel so betrayed."
94nw17,1,2018-08-04,How do I get my boyfriend to have sex with me?,NoSomewhere8,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/94nw17/how_do_i_get_my_boyfriend_to_have_sex_with_me/,"Me (24) and my boyfriend (23) have been together for six  months and we have a great romantic chemistry. Early on, we didn't do anything sexual for a while (probably for the first 3 weeks of dating), but we eventually started fooling around (pretty much doing everything EXCEPT actual intercourse). The reason we didn't have sex early on is because I don't have much experience doing it and didn't want to rush into it, and he knew that and was totally okay with it. He did tell me several times that he never feels sexually satisfied without doing actual intercourse but was happy to take things slow. He told me much later that he values intercourse so much because it helps him feel connected to who he is with on a deeper level.

Fast forward. I left town for 6 weeks for an internship, so we obviously didn't do anything for that period. When I got back we fooled around once and then he just stopped initiating and didn't seem interested when I tried to initiate, so I just stopped too. I told him when I got back that I was ready to have sex with him and he ball is in his court. 

It's now been a full month since we've done anything sexual. I asked him about it last night and he told me that he just isn't interested in sexual stuff at all anymore ""because it's been so long."" He also told me that he never initiates because ""we went so long without it, and it felt like early on I wasn't having sex with him because I didn't want to feel that close connection to him."" He knows that is not the reason we didn't have sex in the early days, but he can't seem to shake it. He told me last night that he now doesn't feel comfortable touching me like that because it feels wrong to do - reason being that we went so long early on and never established that sexual connection that he values so much. He told me that we messed up by not having sex earlier on.

He said that he doesn't know how to fix this and neither do I. I love him and we do want to stay together, but I am totally lost about how to fix this and rekindle our sexual chemistry.

94oy69,2,2018-08-04,"I [M, 20] was in a long-distance relationship with a guy [M, 22] and he broke up with me to ""find himself"".",theitalianstallion97,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/94oy69/i_m_20_was_in_a_longdistance_relationship_with_a/,"Hey Everyone,

So I [M, 20] was in a long-distance relationship with a guy [M, 22] for just over a year and just earlier on in the month he broke up with me to ""find himself"". We met on a dating app, complete strangers to one another, but we had an awesome relationship. We go to schools eight hours away, but we live 30 minutes away when home for the summers. Despite being opposites in many ways (myself being an extrovert and him being an introvert), we got along wonderfully and found common ground in our core moral and religious values. We never bickered or had a huge fight and things were totally awesome.

Around the beginning of the summer though, he dropped the ball completely and saw me sparingly for a month and a half. He had a busy work schedule and whenever he got out of work he claimed didn't want to spend time on anyone but himself. However, throughout the half of the summer we were still together, he planned three trips - one with his family, another with his friends, and a final trip to Chicago to see his cousin. I spoke up about the matter, telling him I felt like I was not a priority and he honestly told me that although we didn't have to do long distance in the summer months, he preferred the space from me.

Fast forward a day or two, he texts me to schedule a date. Ecstatic I confirmed plans and we spent our first day together in months. However, the whole day he seemed distant and emotionally distant. Come 10 or 11 o'clock at night he told me he couldn't be in a relationship anymore and needed to find himself. He also said that he shouldn't have been in a relationship to begin with, but fell for me hard a year ago and forgot. I told him I loved him (for the first time ever, cause better now than never) and He broke down into tears and I comforted him a ton. He said he was stressed out from prepping for his internship and his study abroad and said something had to budge. I literally spent the next hour drying his tears, making him laugh, and reminiscing with him. Obviously nobody wants to break up, but that break up was the IDEAL break-up.

Come a week and a half later, to fill the void I downloaded a dating app to simply scroll over some profiles (not looking for anything serious) and I saw his profile.. updated with new pictures of him and everything. I felt like I had been punched in the gut, so I did the foolish thing and reached out to him through text. I poured my heart to him and four days later he replied with a text saying he wasn't ignoring me and that he had a message he felt was well-thought out. He gist of the message was that we had something awesome, but that he broke up with me when we were at an all time high so he didn't resent the relationship or me in the coming months. Over all, the message was emotionally distant and reeked of ""I'm getting over you, you should get over me too"". A far far cry from him sobbing in my car a week and a half earlier.

It has been a month now - I have deleted him off all social media except for Instagram and have noticed that he dipped down but is now back at the top of my Instagram stories viewers (meaning, he is creeping on my profile).

I don't know what to think of this entire situation, I can't read him or what he wants but I know for a fact I will not be breaking no contact unless he reaches out.

I just want to know if there's ever a chance to date him again, because we had the most unproblematic and pleasant relationship in the world and I loved him (and still do).

In past relationships he was cheated on and treated like garbage and he said I was one of the best boyfriends he has ever had or ever will have. I would surprise him with care-packages, pray with him, give him plenty of alone time, and so much more. I was his first boyfriend that didn't pressure him to have sex and I believe in God just as he does. He said he didn't have to settle with me, like he had in the past. I would do literally anything for him, but he just tossed me aside like I was nothing. I checked all his boxes, but he still left.

I also want to know if ""finding himself"" is just a cop out line or if he truly needs to find himself? He is a very introspective person and I could see that being a true need of his, but him being on a dating app days after breaking up with me seems sketchy.

Thoughts, opinions??"
94pos5,6,2018-08-05,Pretty empty feeling. Any advice?,Slim_Shady1997,survivinginfidelity,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/94pos5/pretty_empty_feeling_any_advice/,"This summer, my GF of 3.5 years F(21) and I M(20) had an internship and pretty much got plastered all the time and had a good time with her co workers. Oh well whatever, I picked her up quite a bit and took care of her when she was blacked out twice and it was miserable but I love her so I got over it. Until one night I felt like she has been hiding something for a while. After investing (I know) she had send pretty vulgur and specific things she wanted to do to her co worker (male) and went on about this dream she had about him. She also went on to say ""and Slim_Shady1997...well...we are ""dating"" but I look to him as a brother tbh and  we only have this apartment until December and I'm 21 and I just want to kiss boys"". So this hit pretty hard and pretty deep. Given she was very very drunk. I don't know what to do. And I'm pretty shook right now and quite honestly I feel sick. She's usually very shy and not outgoing. I have never texted a girl that way sober or drunk so this feels pretty sad. Anyway I'll wrap this up. Does anyone have any advice? I know I have to confront her. And I'm almost debating ending things. But I'm so emotional right now I don't know what to do.

EDIT: Thanks guys! It's been a very very very very long draining night and to realize all this is coming to an end is pretty dramatic and hard to deal with. All of you are pretty much right and I'm gonna have to accept the fact that she has checked out. Thank you all for the support. "
94q88a,4,2018-08-05,Did I choose the wrong school?,confusedthrowaway60,UGA,https://www.reddit.com/r/UGA/comments/94q88a/did_i_choose_the_wrong_school/,"So, I also posted this on r/gatech but I wanted to post it here too for different points of view.

I’m a freshman going to GT in the fall, and even after attending FASET (orientation), I can’t shake the feeling that I’ve chosen the wrong school. My two main choices for college were GT and UGA, and I chose GT because of the location, rankings, and opportunities it would bring. Don’t get me wrong, I love GT and I think it’s an amazing school. But I also love UGA, and needed advice about transferring. Initially, I had said yes to GT and UGA but ended up only paying the commitment deposit to GT. I contacted the UGA department of admissions back in May (after the commitment deadline) because I was having these same feelings and explained that I’d like to enroll after all. They told me that I couldn’t enroll as there were no spots left, and my only option was to transfer in during Summer/Fall 2019 or later. I was planning on spending a year at GT, and if I didn’t like it, I could transfer. This would be fine with me other than the fact that I probably won’t be able to find a great consistent group of friends at UGA since I would be missing out on the freshman experience and most other 2nd years would already have a group. I’d also have to get used to a new campus and location. I tried searching for others who have posted about transferring to UGA from GT but it seems like most people only try and do it the other way around. I thought going to orientation would make me sure in my decision and I’d definitely love it, but I still have a feeling I chose the wrong place. There were some moments that made me love it, like seeing Atlanta (I love cities and atl is a big plus). The campus is beautiful and the people I met were super nice too.

In terms of academics, I’m not set on what I want to do. I’m very heavily leaning towards pre-med right now, but at GT I’d want to major in IE and concentrate in econ because I genuinely love learning about those subjects. I’m also considering neuroscience at GT, because if I transferred to UGA then I’d be interested in their cognitive science major or their double dawgs program. UGA would definitely be better in terms of credits and graduating on time since some of my ap scores aren’t accepted at GT and would be at UGA. I’ve also read that UGA would be better for grad school/med school admissions, because it would be slightly easier to make a higher gpa. GT is noticeable better in terms of opportunities though, and the networking and internship connections are unmatched. It wouldn’t be impossible to make it into a med school from GT either.

I also might be biased because my best friend is going to be a 2nd year there, and I’ve remained close with her and seen her experience at UGA almost first-hand. I don’t know anyone that well at GT and so I can’t speak to the experience there.

In short:

Reasons to stay at GT

1. I may end up loving it (I can only see after I actually go there though lol)
2. Atlanta is amazing and there way more things to do (I already bought tickets for so many concerts and events)
3. Tech’s academics and opportunities are unmatched, the possible alumni connections, and the fact that I know I would graduate with a good job if med school doesn’t pan out.
4. I loved the people I met at FASET (a lot of them were like me)
5. Tech's culture of innovation and their dedication to it is amazing
6. Not many people transfer out of GT, or if they do, it's because they couldn't handle the academics. I talked to a current CS major there and he said that most people would not want to leave schools. But I've seen many people want to transfer out of UGA
7. Rankings don't matter much IMO, but tech is ranked really highly in every ranking out there, it's truly among the world's best universities and carries more prestige. I'm not sure how if it would be important in med school admissions though.

Reasons to transfer to UGA

1. Could be easier to get into med school (more specific and dedicated pre-health program and easier to get a higher gpa)
2. Seeing my best friend’s experience assured me that I’d have a good time there. I'd also get to be close to her and another close friend who is transferring.
3. Most UGA grads find a good job after graduation too, and UGA produces many Rhodes/Fulbright/etc Scholars, so it's a school where people can achieve a lot if they want to
4. UGA athletics
5. I know some people at UGA already through my friend, and all of them seem like great people that I’d get along with.
6. This might be something small, but UGA's dining, dorms, and parking/transportation services seem to be way better than Tech's. This is what I've gauged from the two schools' subreddits and my friend.
7. It's way easier to get other classes in different fields/majors there. Registering at FASET was hell because most classes are major restricted and I want to explore other areas. And UGA has a bigger variety of classes and fields to choose from. This is really important to me because I love the humanities just as much as I love STEM.

TL;DR: I’m going to GT but also love UGA. If I don’t like GT I could transfer but I don’t know if I could make a solid group of friends at UGA as a transfer and there’s certain things I love about GT too. Any thoughts, opinions, stories of others in the same situation are appreciated. Thanks :)"

“God has made us for a reason, for a cause, and a purpose. A purpose is what we are made to do, the reason why we were created and the cause of our living. I believe that we were each born for some higher purpose and it’s our cosmic mission to find it.”

It is safe to say that Dra Farrah Arsenia C. Agustin-Bunch is a woman with a passionate mission. A woman determined to make a difference in the world of medicine; she is a graduate of St. Louis University in Baguio City while completing her internship in China and Scotland and also completed a Holistic Health Practice from Natural Healing College in Los Angeles, California.

Her passion stems from a deep desire to go beyond a diagnosis to determine what the cause of a disease, particularly cancer is. To fulfill her purpose, Dra Farrah, along with her father, the world-famous herbalist, Sir Antonio Agustin. The patriarch developed the first natural cancer treatment center in the Philippines in 2000 and together with Dra Farrah; they later on developed The Dra Farrah Method.

The method named after her is unique because of its different approach to treating cancer.

“In conventional medicine, the focus is the disease, in alternative medicine, the focus is the patient,” she said.

Dra Farrah believes in a treatment called Integrative Medicine, an approach that combines conventional medicine with alternative interventions that help overcome and compensate for the abject failures of chemotherapy, radiation and surgery.

Her method works to reach the cause of cancer by eliminating toxins eradicating both the cancer and the cause. Treatments are entirely tailored to the individual, as works closely with her patients to determine the best way to treat them.

The Dr. Farrah Method has made Dr. Farrah the leader in the field with 15 years of experience in integrative cancer treatments as well as introducing the word “immunopathy” to the world. The cornerstone of the treatment is Boston C, invented by Dr. Farrah herself, as well as other support system necessary for the patient.

I am having several problems, the main one being that I am not retaining the material I study whether it is for school or personal development. I keep having trouble reading for even 10 minutes and have not found what is the best way for me to retain that material.

My job is extremely flexible as I can make my own work schedule. However, I have been finding it dull and not challenging enough anymore, because of this I work the bare minimum to pay my bills instead of working longer hours to pay my student loans and save money. The sole purpose for staying there is that next year I will be integrated into the company with high pay (intern at present time), even as an intern it pays very well and there are great benefits.

My last issue, is that I have been developing horrible eating habits. I keep eating junk food and eating out a lot, thus not only am I wasting money but I am also rapidly gaining weight. Although this is not my highest priority to solve, it feels like it makes all other issues even more difficult. I know how to cook healthy food, but am always craving sugary and junk food. It has become a vicious cycle of consuming bad food and being clumsy/tired throughout the day. 

Any advice for any/all of these is appreciated! I hope everyone has had a great weekend/day!"

After some particularly bad days, my family informed me that my mom is actually emotionally abusive. 
It’s effected me in more ways than I thought, as my communication skills are not what they should be. I don’t have the courage to tell people things that they might not like, and I can’t deal with conversations going south. I’m afraid of conflict. Me saying my opinion has never gone well so I just disregard my own thoughts because I don’t think they matter.

These conversations never go well no matter how far in advance I tell her.  She starts yelling at me saying “what if we had plans”, which we didn’t. I always apologize saying that I’m sorry that I didn’t think, and then I’m called self centered. 
I’d like to mention that I have a language processing disorder (dyslexia). My mother is well aware of this, she has it, too. 
Keep in mind, I’m a good kid. I don’t do drugs or smoke weed. I don’t come home drunk, or bring boys over. I get good grades, and I like to think that I’m a very kind and respectful person. I was accepted to all 5 colleges that I applied to, and I’ve gotten several academic and athletic awards. I’m really not a bad kid. I’m not rebellious. I’m not disrespectful. I don’t yell, I don’t slam doors. I’m incredibly chill and open to anything, as I have to be to mentally survive. 

Sorry that this post might be disorganized.

Whenever I go to my dads house, she is constantly either texting my sister and I what we do wrong in our life, or she is trying to hang out with us, every day. For example, during Christmas break, we spend 2 weeks with her, and 2 weeks with our dad. Seems fair, right? Well she kept inviting us to events and lunch dates. She wanted to see us every day. She doesn’t like us being with our dad, obviously. She’s rather us hang out with her 24/7. 
Now, my dad isn’t a bad person. He left my mom  almost 2 years ago. His health had been deteriorating and he just didn’t know how much emotional abuse he could take, and how much he could watch us take. Now that he’s away, he’s doing much much better.
I’ve bent over backwards my entire life trying to make her happy, but with not much success. During the divorce, she was actually really nice, and I was confused. Weird, right? I can’t do anything right. It’s like walking on egg shells every day. It’s terrifying. 
I can think of several times she has gas lit me, two in particular. The first was during the summer of my sophomore year of hs. I had signed up for several volunteer opportunities to keep me busy (as my mother hates when I have time to myself). I got accepted to all of them, so my mother told me to drop one, as I didn’t have time for all of them. I did. She finds this out, and things got loud quick. I cry, she yells more. “What are you going to do this summer?!” Well I have other things to do, so those?! As usual, I’m the foolish one. She slams the door shut and I go to xc practice balling my eyes out from being so confused. 
The second one was recently. I was manipulated into coming home for college instead of finding an internship somewhere else. My mother had told me that I shouldn’t bother finding an internship or job this summer, as we’ll be traveling all summer so it will be hard. Constantly, I’ve been yelled at for not having a job. I get it, I should have one, but I was told specifically not to get one so we could have more family time. The more I tell this story, the less it sounds true, honestly. 
My mother, despite this, is very loving and caring. I no longer tell her my feelings though, as everything I feel sad about, makes me get yelled at, as everything I feel sad about, is my fault. I could of prevented it, but I didn’t bc as usual, I don’t think. 
Side note, my mother cut off all communication to her family and has never let my sister or I talk to them or visit them. They didn’t do anything wrong to her. She, as a lot of people say, is crazy.
This summer has stressed me out more than I could of imagined, which is why I will start therapy as soon as I get to college. I won’t be coming home next summer, I’ll find an internship somewhere else. I don’t ever want to come home again. It’s too stressful. That’s an unhealthy view, but I’ve been living in a stressful environment for so long, that I would just like some relief for longer than a school year. I chose to go to college out of state just so that I could get away and be happy. I’ve really enjoyed it, but I’ve mostly enjoyed the freedom it’s given me to be my own person."

[I wrote about the first time here.](https://old.reddit.com/r/gaystoriesgonewild/comments/8tcjmp/gonna_be_a_good_summer_got_fucked_by_a_19_year/). He is living with some conservative relatives that always wonder where he is and want him to date nice Christian girls they keep trying to set him up with, so he comes over to my apartment right after work, fucks me, washes his dick, and then heads home for dinner. He's real hot. He's 19, 5'9"", top, with buzzed blonde hair and is a complete bro. You wouldn't know he likes guys until you see his dick up a dudes hole.   I'm 25, blonde and am starting to get some muscles on me. I've been going into work 30 minutes early every day this summer so I can leave 30 minutes early so I can shower/get cleaned up if he wants to come over after work.  

The intern didn't have much technique when he started fucking me except for the ability to cum twice in 20 minutes. My hole likes cum so that was just fine with me. He is a good kisser but he didn't do much when it comes to foreplay except put a finger up my hole. I realized this the second time and started lubing myself after showering, but after four or five hookups I really wanted his tongue in my hole or some other foreplay.  

When he texted that second week asking if I wanted fucked after work, I said yeah but asked him why he never rimmed. He said he did it once and didn't like it. I asked if he was up for trying it again and he said maybe.  I asked him what else he was into and he said he liked poppers but didn't know where to get them. I had not used poppers with him yet but I buy them online and have them at home. I asked if he could get out of work a little early today so we could have more time to play today and he could, so I could have a full hour with him before he had to go home for dinner. He said sure, and I went home early to get cleaned up.   

I opened the door to my apartment in just a jockstrap and he came in and started kissing me. He is always really aggressive on kissing, but because we had extra time I made him slow down. I had poured myself a vodka soda before he came over and he could taste the vodka on my breath and asked if he could have one too. He poured himself one and I stripped him down to naked and made him sit on the couch. I took poppers out of the table beside the couch and when he saw them his eyes lit up. He took a hit and I started blowing him and he got aggressive and tried shoving his cock down me. I took a hit and then my throat opened up and I started going deeper. We made out again as I went back up. I told him to slowly finish his drink as I worked on his dick. I kept switching to just sucking on his balls to make sure he didn't cum too quickly.   

When he was done with his vodka, I took the poppers and moved him to the bedroom. We got on the bed and I flipped to a 69 and started blowing him again. For the first time in four hookups he started sucking my dick. He wasn't that good at it, but I kept encouraging him and telling him to take it deeper. I put him on his back and told him to use poppers again. When he did I got into a 69 above him and had my hole now facing him. He got the hint and started kissing the outside of my hole. He groaned and I figured the poppers were working and then he started really getting into it. I could feel his stubble on my ass.   

I pulled off the 69 and had him take poppers again and then I layed on my back and pulled my legs up. He got between my legs again. I shoved his face onto my balls. He started licking them, and I pulled my legs up and told him to lick under my ballsack. He got the hint and started licking my taint and I could feel him licking down closer to my hole. I pulled my legs up and told him to eat my ass again. He got really into it. I was moaning. I grabbed the lube and told him to use poppers again and then lube his dick up. He did and put his dickhead on my hole. He slid in the fastest he had ever done and his eyes got real wide in surprise. He just did a few thrusts when he said he was going to cum and went deep inside of me. He shoots really big loads and I could feel it and I know my eyes got real wide in surprise as it felt like the biggest load he had ever fucked into me.    

When he pulled out and we both caught our breath he said he was surprised how hot he found eating my ass to be. I pulled him in and gave him a big kiss and told him he was going to fuck me again. I kept stroking his dick. It was lubed up both with lube and with his cum. He didn't lose his hard on and I flipped onto my back and I could feel him mounting me again and I felt his dick slip in.    

His second fuck always goes much longer and he fucked me real hard for about 15 minutes. He stopped a couple of times to use poppers. This time I used poppers too. They always make me real slutty and I usually beg for cum in my hole when I use them. I was begging for his load and telling him to fill me up. He started speeding up and I could feel his dick getting bigger. On my stomach with his dick in my ass I couldn't touch my dick and so all of the feeling was on his dick in my ass. He gave me a bear hug and his thrusting got really aggressive. He told me he was going to cum in me and I could feel him shooting his second load. He kept thrusting until his dick got too sensitive and then pulled out. I flipped onto my back and told him to put a finger into my ass and I started jerking off, and came in just a couple of seconds.   

We got cleaned up and we showered together. He said eating my ass was hotter than he thought it would be but he didn't know if he was doing it right. I kissed him and told him he had the entire summer to figure it out.  

We dried off and he went home to his conservative family for a home cooked dinner, and I poured another vodka, ordered a pizza and lazily fingered the cum in my hole until the delivery guy arrived.   "
94trj1,14,2018-08-05,T30 for $7.50 installed kubuntu - Unsecure passwords - story,kidfitzz,thinkpad,https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/94trj1/t30_for_750_installed_kubuntu_unsecure_passwords/,"Interesting story I thought you would all enjoy.

Last week I found an old T20 IBM lenovo thinkpad in my office storage (im a tech intern). I fixed it up and got windows 2k to boot up!! The admin user had no password associated and I got right in without a problem!

So imagine my surprise when I take my girlfriend out to a local thrift shop and spot a T30!!! There was no price listed so i found an employee and they priced it at 15.00 for me. But it was half off day so I got it for only $7.50 (side note I now have four thinkpads.......). It was pretty dirty and sold without  a charger but I thought that I would be able to fix it up and restore it back to life.

I bring the laptop home and find that it has kubuntu installed and 1gb of memory (fun fact this was listed as max 1gb of ram but it can handle 2, and I think i have some old ram at my work that they will let me use). I load up the system and of course I have no idea about the user name, so I tried all the standards (root, password, etc) and I found out that I have root access with just a little change in the spelling of the full distro. I log in and find the other user is ""travis"". I looked at the password hash and I could see just from looking at it that the password was probably not anything difficult. I log in with the password ""travis"" and TADAH! full access on the laptop I bought! Now I'm no nefarious hacker I was just REALLY CURIOUS and happened to get in with a bit of guess work. Just remember people that even if I didnt guess the password, if you have root access you can get the password hash - and from there my main desktop would have no problem brute forcing an all lowercase password. 

RESET THE LAPTOP BEFORE YOU DELL/DONATE

now... what to do with this thing...."
94u6fj,13,2018-08-05,"My [24F] long distance bf [24M] puts everyone before me, acts like nothing is wrong",throwaway93852456521,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/94u6fj/my_24f_long_distance_bf_24m_puts_everyone_before/," Using a throwaway bc my bf knows my username.

I've (24f) been living with my boyfriend (24m) for the past year. We've been dating for almost 2 years. Everything was absolutely perfect, we live well together and always get along and there are very rarely fights. The only problem I have is that he played video games \*constantly\*. From the moment he wakes up until it's time to go to bed. The only time he stops is if he absolutely has to do something (i.e. go to class, buy groceries, take out trash, sleep). Even then he plays the video games on his phone. Whenever I brought it up, he said he plays to keep in touch with his friends from home. He has a group of 8-12 friends who he was raised with from birth, but they're super aggressive, and if he doesn't play video games for any period of time, they bully him and call him names, they tell him I'm a bad gf, etc. He calls them every single day, for hours and hours at a time, regardless if I want to do something else with him or go out. He's always put me second to them in any situation, which bothers me a lot, but I understand the importance of friends, and I appreciate how hard he works to keep contact with them even though they're far away.

So now, we had to move out and go back to our parents' houses for financial reasons. Neither of us have a job so we're living with our parents until we can find employment. He's \~600 miles away now. We decided to stay together long distance until we know how things are going to end up with jobs/finances/etc. We want to move back in together if we can. We've been long distance before, for a few months when he took an international internship, and everything worked out okay. It's been a week since we moved.

He's been catching up with his friends every single day. He won't answer any of my calls if he's around them. He hung up on me without a second thought because he thought he saw a friend pull into his driveway. He only Skypes me at the very end of the night, after he's done playing his video games with them, and only for 5-10 minutes because by then he's too tired to stay up to talk to me. Yesterday, he spent 9+ hours just sitting around with them, but he \*never\* used to do that with me when I'd ask, because he would claim that it makes him too bored and he needs video games to keep his mind active.

I've been having a lot of trouble adjusting to being home. I've been struggling with severe depression and suicidal thoughts, and I can't afford to seek professional help. On Friday I asked him for help, but he seemed to not care at all and would barely respond. He hung up on me to play more videogames because he said he made a commitment to his friends that he'd play with them.

Every time I try to bring up that I feel like I'm being treated like less than everyone else, he blows me off and waits for me to get over it and not be mad anymore. I don't like holding a grudge so I try to just get over it so I don't feel bad all the time. He doesn't make any effort at all to consider my feelings or fix anything.

Yesterday I got upset with him about how he's been treating me, and he said he'd try to do better and promised that he spend all day Sunday (today) with me today on Skype, since he had nothing else to do.

Now, the morning of, he called me and said he's made other commitments to these friends to go rock climbing and go out to do stuff, and that he never actually meant he'd Skype me ""all day"". He said he would never waste an entire day just Skyping me since that'd be too boring, even though he used to do that with his friends all the time when we lived together. He said it's my fault for misunderstanding what he said before. We got into a really bad fight, and I was begging him to just stay and skype me and not go. It ended with him hanging up to go rock climbing.

I feel like at this point I should just break up with him, but I really don't want to. I've blocked him on most social media platforms after our phone call this morning, because I was so angry with him. We never used to fight at all, let alone let it escalate to this. I don't understand why I am being treated so much worse than all of his friends, and he doesn't seem to care at all. He's never the one to call first or initiate conversation, but he says he loves me and wants to stay together. I really think he genuinely has no idea what he's doing wrong, even though I'm spelling it out for him.

I feel like if I break up with him then I'm losing the last good thing I have right now. I'll really have nothing worth waking up for. This whole situation has me so sad all the time. I feel like I'm always going to be beneath his friends, and as long as they're telling him to do something, he will never make time to talk to me.

I'm looking for honest advice. I'm not sure what action to take, if I should forgive him and keep trying, or if enough is enough. I honestly can't tell if I'm overreacting because this has been happening for so long that I don't have any tolerance for it anymore."

94unhz,1,2018-08-05,"Only I have made the effort to visit [M/20, F/19]",gowiththeflow02,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/94unhz/only_i_have_made_the_effort_to_visit_m20_f19/,"First time post here, I just need to talk.

I have been with my SO for over three years, and for the first year she lived in Canada and I lived in the United States. For the first year her parents would not let her visit, so I did several times. For the past two out of three years, we have gone to university in the same city, which closed the distance gap during the school year; however, she still has not made the effort to come visit me in the US, even though I still continued to go back to Canada as much as possible. Our relationship is wonderful besides this one issue, but I am finding it unbearable. The last time she met any of my friends or family was 2015, which I find to be unacceptable, considering that she lives in a city with easy access to two airports. I have had to make a 2 hour trip to the airport every visit. She only made the trip to visit once for one weekend in June of 2016, but that was because she had an internship in NYC that summer, so none of the visits have been just for me. I know all of her friends and family and none of mine know her, which creates this really strange dynamic. There have always been excuses, whether its a family vacation or work (she need to travel abroad for work), and simply finding one weekend, even over the summer, has been difficult even though I have been ready and willing every time. I cannot help but feel resentful, and part of me selfishly feels that she needs to make up for all the times I visited over the years. I brought this up to her yesterday, and she promised me that tomorrow she would book a ticket to come visit, but after all this time I still feel depressed. I just needed to rant. I am not sure what to feel anymore."
94unvv,1,2018-08-05,A lot a rather small problems makes them bigger,ShinyChatot,sad,https://www.reddit.com/r/sad/comments/94unvv/a_lot_a_rather_small_problems_makes_them_bigger/,"Dear redditors, I feel you can help me here. I mostly would like to say what I need to say. Maybe it's the wrong subreddit but I think I'm right.
Well first of all, I'm a 23yo virgin so needless to say it begins to bother me a bit. I'll do trainings (internships ?) next year so maybe I'll meet someone. Ironically, I'm in a field with 90% girls and can't find one because either they're already with someone (most cases), either we dont have the same views of the world. l still have no contract but I sent my résumés late so I wait until the end of the holiday season to send them again.
Also, a much but weirder important problem is that I have some weird things happening in my mouth. As I live with my parents I cannot do everything I want like going away even for an hour without telling them. Plus the problem was going away. It got worse but now is getting better again. I have the feeling that my parents don't care, like ""ok I'll call the dentist if it gets worse"" but even when it does I have to insist. It's lasting for about 3 weeks now. Normally we'll call the dentist in 2 days, but I'll try to insist to call her tomorrow (we're not home for the moment but come back tomorrow afternoon) so that I hope we could have a date sooner, even a short one between 2 patients (which my dentist does sometimes). Also, another problem is that almost everyone in my country (especially the media) uses wrong spellings and it annoys me a lot. Some spellings even have a political meaning so it's worse. Talking about politics, it's bad and it makes me sad. And the last thing is that more and more websites spread a theory I don't believe in, which made me go away from a famous French forum and 9gag so that I found a shelter here. Maybe I'm wrong in beliving this theory is wrong but it's not proven and changing a thing for another when almost no one complained and that neutrality is biased is not right.
Thank you very much for reading all this and taking the time to answer."
94usip,4,2018-08-05,SpongeBob SquarePants made Simple,MyUsernameIsReallyOk,BikiniBottomTwitter,https://www.reddit.com/r/BikiniBottomTwitter/comments/94usip/spongebob_squarepants_made_simple/," SpongeBob SquarePants which is a show with a target demographic of young kids, ten and below, and teenagers and college kids scanning through to make memes. It's most well know, obviously, for the main character SpongeBob SquarePants. This is his name, as he is a sponge and has square pants. 

The show encapsulates SpongeBob SquarePants' ( For future reference, we will simply call him 'SpongeBob' ) adventures. It takes him across the ocean and simply to his job. He, SpongeBob ( SquarePants ), is a fry cook at a local restaurant that resides in Bikini Bottom named The Krusty Krab. 'Krusty' is normally spelled as 'crusty' but it was spelled with a K ( 11th letter in the English alphabet ) as the letter C ( third letter in the English alphabet [ alphabets started with the Phoenician alphabet, apologies for not clarifying with the letter 'K' ] sound similar. Both of these letters make a 'ca' sound or, a 'ka' sound. The same thing is done with 'krab'. 'Krab' is usually spelled with the third letter from the English alphabet, C. It is done this way as to be more unique. SpongeBob's ( SquarePants ) job at The Krusty Krab ( as said before, Krusty and Krab are normally spelled with a 'C' ) is, as mentioned before, acting as the resident fry cook. He makes 'Krabby Patties' ( 'Krabby' is normally spelled with a 'C', making it crabby ) which take the appearance of hamburgers, or cheeseburgers ( Hamburgers and cheeseburgers are made from beef, which comes from cows ). What the Krabby Patty ( Krabby Patties, as said first is the plural version of Krabby Patty ) is actually consisted of is unknown. This, leads to the main antagonist, Plankton ( He is named Plankton as he is designed after a Plankton [ Plankton are normally far smaller than Plankton { The character from the children, teenager and college students show, SpongeBob SquarePants } but he is enlarged for the sake of the show ] ) whose main goal is to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula ( a 'secret formula' is a recipe that is kept hidden as to keep it exclusive ). He, Plankton ( I didn't specify before, and I apologise, but his full name is Sheldon Plankton. This makes 'Plankton' his last name. He goes by Plankton instead of Sheldon because he prefers Plankton over Sheldon. [ Another example of this would be Christopher Turk from Scrubs, an NBC sitcom about the life of John Dorian who goes by JD which is taking the first letter from John, J, and the first letter from Dorian, D, and making it into a name which is JD. John Dorian, we will call him JD, starts off as an intern at Sacred Heart hospital which is run by Bob Kelso. Bob, as often done, stands for Robert. The NBC show Scrubs shows John Dorian's, or JD's, progressive advancement through the feild of medicine ] ) is married to Karen who is a computer. The relationship seems to be platonic, as Karen seems to have fully functional AI ( AI stands for Artificial Intelligence ) and consented to the marriage. Plankton runs a restaurant named the Chum Bucket. The Chum Bucket resides across the street from The Krusty Krab ( crusty crab ). The Chum Bucket sells chum, as is seen in the same of the restaurant, which is The Chum Bucket. The Chum Bucket does very bad in business and gets almost no customers throughout the entire show. This is because 'chum' is usually made from fish. Most of the characters in the show ( SpongeBob SquarePants ) happen to be fish. This is the reason he wants to steal the Krabby ( crabby ) Patty formula, as to improve his restaurant. Plankton fails to realize that even if he did sell Krabby ( crabby ) Patty formula that people would still attend the restaurant they usually do, The Krusty Krab ( crusty crab ). Back to The Krusty Krab ( crusty crab ) is owned by Eugene Krabs ( Mr. Krabs is what Eugene Crabs usually goes by. The Mr. Is commonly put infront of the last name as to be more formal, hence Mr. Krabs. ). Eugene Crabs is commonly seen as greedy man, paying his employees as little as possible and keeping as much as he can for himself. Eugene Krab's employees are Squidward Tentacles ( Squidward Tentacles is SpongeBob SquarePants' neighbor, residing in a house that appears to be a tiki head. Squidward Tentacles is an artist creating such things as Bold and Brash. Squidward Tentacles also plays the clarinet on the regular. Squidward Tentacles is normally seen as a grouch and a 'meanie' [ a mean person ] by children, but adults relate to him as Squidward Tentacles is constantly annoyed by his neighbors, SpongeBob SquarePants and Patrick Star [ Patrick Star is SpongeBob SquarePants best friend. He resides under a rock, and is a starfish. Patrick Star is normally seen as a simpleton and not the brightest bulb. Patrick Star and SpongeBob SquarePants like to do things such blow bubbles. On one occasion, Patrick Star and SpongeBob SquarePants planned to go play golf but it happened to be raining. Patrick Star and SpongeBob SquarePants decided to play inside SpongeBob SquarePants' house { a pineapple that fell to the bottom of the ocean from a boat } instead. ] Squidward Tentacles is supposed to be a squid, but is missing two tentacles. This is due to the fact that it is easier to animate with two less tentacles ) and SpongeBob SquarePants. Eugene Krab's also has a daughter, who is named Pearl. Pearl is a whale, while Eugene Krabs is a crab. This is impossible, so we assume adoption. Pearl was designed to be like a stereotypical highschool teenage girl. She appreciates make up, dresses, and of course, boys. Eugene Krabs and Pearl Krabs both reside in an Anchor  made into a home. 

SpongeBob SquarePants' other friends that appear frequently through the show, are Gary the Snail ( Gary the Snail is a snail that is designed to be like a cat ) and Sandy the Squirrel. Sandy the Squirrel lives in what appears to be a biodome underwater. It has a tree and grass to produce oxygen as she can't breathe in water, which the other characters do ( this though, is incorrect. They actually breathe dissolved oxygen found in the water ). She wears a suit that looks to be a sort of space suit, but for underwater. She uses this to breathe when not in her home, the biodome. When in the biodome she only wears her underwear is is oddly sexual for a children's show ( I have stated that it is also a teenager and college students show, and this is correct. At the time of the making this was not the intent and only became such due to memes.[ Apologies for not clarifying before, but memes are funny images posted online ]  ). 

SpongeBob SquarePants goes through many other adventures throughout the show, but this is a very simple and basic summary of the show. I would recommend watching it as it still airs on Nickelodeon.  "
94ux10,1,2018-08-05,My husband is switching careers and needs help finding a position in programming.,Banafrit,OKCJobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/OKCJobs/comments/94ux10/my_husband_is_switching_careers_and_needs_help/,"As the title says my husband is switching careers. He currently has a masters in political science and a background in direct sales and works on commission. He is currently finishing a bachelors in computer science and wants to get a job or even an internship to build experience.

It seems companies see that he is well educated and pass him up. He is willing to work from the bottom up. He is a hard worker, he just needs a break.

If anyone has a lead on a job or internship it would be greatly appreciated."

It wasn't easy, but being both college students and having our academic calendars line up, it wasn't too difficult to coordinate things and see each other. We ended up seeing each other about four times during the year. This summer we're back together, I graduated and I've found work in DC. She found an internship in DC as well, and we lived together. It has been the most incredible thing ever. But summer is ending, and she has one year left of undergrad before graduating. I don't want to go back to LDR, I really hate that. I know that we will be fine, I just know I'm going to have a hard time readjusting once she leaves. Also last year we were only two hours apart, but now that she is returning to the West Coast, we'll be three hours apart, and it'll be harder to sync up our schedules. We'll be fine, but I almost got used to the idea of living with her. For a while, we had a normal relationship. I'm not stuck on this, I'm not letting it affect me or how I am with her. We've shared briefly how much we didn't want this to end, and we're going to make the best out of the last two and a half weeks that we have together, but I just need to write this out and share this.

Hey! I’m looking for someone willing to play long term, and so many characters. As for me, I would like to play a young Taylor Swift or Dove Cameron. Somewhere between the age of 16-19 and coming off a smash hit album (or show). That first one was totally innocent but now, my manager (played by you) wants me to get little more risqué. Show some more skin, sing some filthier songs. Maybe even get some body enhancements. 

Essentially this is a slow but steady bimbofication prompt that centers around a celeb (either Taylor or Dove). I might be open to trying another celeb but you’d have to convince me. 

Characters you’d likely play (this could expand or shrink based on how you wanna do this): my manager who’s pushing me into the bimbo world for his filthy reasons, other slutty artists I’m now forced to collaborate with, maybe the office intern who falls for me as I under go my transition or more!

My kinks are humiliation, facials, excessive cum, lactation, anything with my ass, queefing, bimbofication and so much more. Only limits are toilet, gore and animals. 

I’ll try to get to as many people as I can but bare with me. "
94wnr9,5,2018-08-05,Schmoedown Reddit League 06/8,Heald,Schmoedown,https://www.reddit.com/r/Schmoedown/comments/94wnr9/schmoedown_reddit_league_068/,"First off, I would like to say I have spent the week studying my numbers and now can officially confirm I can count to ten! Sorry for the screw up with the questions last week, me brain wasn't with me it seemed! However having two very hard questions and letting you pick which one you can answer seems like more work for me but a good idea for question 10s going forward. If you guys are down with that I can start implementing it. 

We turn the page in the calender to August and end the month of July with 2 sitting pretty at the top of the monthly league u/Maverick1905 and u/tmitche23 only dropping 5 points during 5 weeks of play! June's winner u/SarmerBinlar is in second only 1 point behind them after having perfect week  and u/Silence_of_the_Hams and _thedroflegend taking bronze with 39. 

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c3fOUTo8Q2A2v_aI_U8uMl3A1aLdenl7klEHeakRBz0/edit?usp=sharing 

As I mentioned Sarmerbinlar ran the board last week getting 10/10 (even if he avoided the topic he requested!) Maverick1905 and Tmitche23 took 9 each along with thedroflegend along with recent debutants u/Maulbert and u/MichaelCampbeII. Silence_of_the_hams, u/EntZec, u/hiptones and u/tkerrig share the spoils of 3rd with 8.

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ETXrX5fp_TlS6QO_pE0s664nElaVUdSV_LSRxRfRHiM/edit?usp=sharing 

In the overall Sarmerbinlar extends his lead to five but below him has started to heat up  with 7 points separating 2nd and 6th. None of them have scored less than 7 last month but if any of them were to start August off poorly they'd be in for a tumble. Also for the first time since this started I've gotten to put someone back on the table! Welcome back u/harleyspuddin!

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g2LJouhO6PtmYdsO7wZ0frMXk43s3DXjwFBWN6Y33tw/edit?usp=sharing 

If you're new you don't need to ask for permission or anything like that, all are welcome! Just post your answers and you're in!  All I ask is that you don't look at other people's answers prior or Google. There's no fun in cheating.

Good luck!

94xhr4,3,2018-08-05,Why do I never feel like I'm doing enough?,avt2020,AnxietyDepression,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxietyDepression/comments/94xhr4/why_do_i_never_feel_like_im_doing_enough/,"Throughout my life I feel like I've never really been able to have fun. I live in a small town and I don't really have many friends because I don't feel like anybody (except my partner) understands me. I've been trying all of my life to get out of this place and I feel like a disappointment being 21 and still stuck at my first job. I hate it. I want to quit so badly because of all the bad memories but there's almost nothing that'd hire me seasonally in my hometown. I graduated from high school early and have a business degree. I'm currently studying drawing and I'll graduate in 2 more years. I have been almost constantly working since I've graduated high school. I've saved the most I possibly could while still doing things like getting tattoos and going on trips but I still feel like I'm not doing enough to get myself to where I want to be.

Throughout my life my parents haven't really supported me. My mother has actually said she wished I could be like the ""normal"" kids that are my age. She got mad that I'd be going to school for an extra year because I changed my major after I got my Associate's degree.
I've never felt like I've belonged in this town whatsoever and I just don't feel welcome here. I feel so free elsewhere and it seems like no matter what I do, it's always too far away from me.
I've spent this summer being stressed out because of a job I should've quit years ago and applying for different jobs. I didn't get anything paid but I got an internship that could lead to a paid position with a big company. I feel great that I got that position after about a month of passively looking for jobs but I still don't feel like it's enough.
My boyfriend today said something that actually hit me: he said I should focus on relaxing. I honestly don't feel like I'm fully capable of relaxing completely. I don't feel like I've ever had a moment in my life besides being with him, away from my town, where I feel free. At home, I have so many headaches. I feel so depressed. At my job, I just gave up because I was assaulted there. I gave up on trying to find a new job because it didn't feel like anybody else would want me to work for them.
I really hate this feeling and I don't know what to do to make it go away."

94yj1m,4,2018-08-06,what would've happened,beforethwaves,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/94yj1m/what_wouldve_happened/,Sometimes I feel almost completely fine and other times are really hard. Today was hard. I started my last week at my summer job and you would've told me how proud you were of me for making it and giving a shit about this minimum wage job. And you'd tell me next summer when I have an internship in New York that kind of mentality will come in handy. And I would brush you off but inside I'd be overjoyed knowing that you believed in me when my parents don't and even I don't believe in myself. But that didn't happen and that never will happen and instead I'm alone in my room eating my 50% off sushi that you'd make fun of me for and dropping my computer science course next semester that you told me I could handle because I underestimate myself but now I won't be able to handle it without you.
94z0pf,6,2018-08-06,How to become an architect as a philosophy major finishing undergrad? [ask],novamateria,architecture,https://www.reddit.com/r/architecture/comments/94z0pf/how_to_become_an_architect_as_a_philosophy_major/,"Hello,

I’m a philosophy student who was set on doing a PhD until I went to a weeklong conference (fully immersive, hotel and everything) and changed my mind. The things that I perceived to be lacking in this path were: 
1) the concreteness and objectivity of the subject matter
2) mathematical/scientific exposure
3) the opportunity to map out schematic frameworks/structures (believe it or not philosophy is usually very micro-level and most papers focus on unraveling one small logical fallacy. The historical greats who integrated the parts of reality into a more comprehensive whole were mostly writers unaffiliated with universities, who achieved fame organically through their fascinating yet controversial theories.)
4) the ability to create something real and solve problems that are universally-recognized as problems 
5) a definitive path to a job.

After that I had to do a bit of soul searching and think about what I really valued, as well as take some distance to evaluate the faculties that weren’t being developed or satisfied by philosophy. Eventually I thought of architecture as a possibility. Realizing that I liked theory, art, design, geometry, mapping, categorization, problem-solving, and conceptual schemes (the idea of proportion, representation, etc.) I realized that architecture could be a field that checked many of these boxes, and might have been overlooked previously. 

After some preliminary research, I became more and more intrigued. I began emailing some architects and architecture professors in my area. A few were kind enough to meet with me or even share books. I also connected with one or two architect alumni from my school to have a chat, then began buying architecture and urban planning books, as well as casually drawing. My drawings are awful but from what I’ve been told I have some pretty promising ideas about spatial orientation, so I’m hoping the artistic skill will come with time and be supplemented by conceptual creativity. I’ve had a lot of fun dipping my toe into this pond but I’m afraid that I’m lying to myself about the feasibility of this path.

All the architects I’ve spoken with have agreed that the M.Arch is essential for job and internship experience. Since I won’t be able to get studio time in school, this means I’ll have to hack at my portfolio alone, and develop architectural literacy of my own accord. Philosophical revelations are good for a statement but you can’t go from dasein to design without true talent! (I apologize for the Heidegger reference but I couldn’t avoid slipping in a pun at least once.) 

Here’s the thing- I can talk anyone’s head off about architecture from a theoretical standpoint, I’m attuned to the details, I’m willing to learn what I don’t know, and I love thinking about how to rearrange space to solve different conundrums. I think those things could serve me. 

However, I’m a shit artist, and I need to fix that. I don’t know if I’m shit because I never drew long enough to get good, or if I’m shit because I’m shit. Perhaps I should have growth mindset and believe that it’s pure practice that will take me where I need to go, or perhaps I should see this as a red flag and consider a different direction. If the latter is true that sucks because I feel like this could be really rewarding if I can make up for lost time. I’d love to start my own practice based on interpretations of the Platonic forms and other philosophical schemes (don’t hate me lmao) then go into academia in my old age to discuss architecture from a semiotic perspective. 

If the former is true, how the hell do I learn what I need to throw together an application to grad school? Exhaustive lists welcome. I’ll do whatever it takes, as long as I actually have a shot.

1046 / 3 = 348 single summons and 2 remaining quartz alongside 113 single summons from tickets

Year One NA FGO gave out enough resources for 461 Free Summons in its initial year

901 / **4** *(4 SQ to 3 SQ cost change occurred in 1st Anniversary) =* 225 singles summons and 1 remaining quartz alongside 98 single summons from tickets.

I expect maybe 3% margin of error, I may have missed some things or ~~I'll blame quickmaths~~ so please feel free to check out the sources if you feel the numbers are off:

[NA Site](https://webview.fate-go.us/)

[JP Site](https://news.fate-go.jp/)

edit: go ahead and downvote this to hell if all you want to do is complain, the numbers are there and properly sourced. but if you want to face check go check for yourself, everything is linked maybe i made a mistake somewhere or forgot some things and the numbers can be changed drastically

or you can argue for the sake of arguing, do whatever you like

edit 2: if people can make long winded posts to hate on a company, why does that make any post that does the opposite automatically ""written by an intern"" as so many of you put it

edit 3: what you should be taking from this is that in NA most of the quartz was given during the game's start up, but at the same time, more quartz was given away due to social media campaigns and to announce what cons the game would be at

edit 4: as by this [comment ](https://www.reddit.com/r/grandorder/comments/950f6d/1st_year_quartz_and_tickets_comparison_na_vs_jp/e3pr4ug)i missed out on quartz and tickets, here is revised final calculation

|NA FGO Year 1 2017/6/25-2018/7/7 (377 Days)|JP FGO Year 1 2015/7/30-2016/7/30 (365 Days)|
|:-|:-|
|1,057 Quartz and 113 Tickets|1,001 Quartz and 112 Tickets|
|465 Single Summons and 1 remainder quartz|362 Single Summons and 1 remainder quartz|

edit 5: the only quartz that was refunded in JP FGO was quartz that was spent on expanding storage, but the refund occurred on the 1st Anniversary so in this post those quartz will count as have been used towards summoning

edit 6: quartz gotten via story and free quests as well as event quests have also been omitted due to those being quartz **everyone (both servers in this post) gets**

edit 7: to put a perspective into this, JP got around 30% of their quartz from maintenance whereas NA got around 10% from maintenance

final edit: this post looks at **possible single summons solely due to the fact that in JP's first year, summoning cost 4 Saint Quartz** whereas in NA's first year, summoning cost 3 Quartz, so therefore looking at Quartz and Tickets given would not be an accurate representation of what you could have used the resources towards"

I run Overwatch @med settings and even then i mostly cant hold my 144hz.


BTW. There are no thermal problems my GPU stays at around 65°C during gaming and my CPU is at ~ 57°C.

I also tried uninstalling the Display Driver with DDU and then reinstalled the newest one.

Edit: I also tried moving the game to my SSD without any improvement.
Also i tried changing the resolution from 1920x1080 to 1280x720 not even this makes any difference.
CPU Usage at ~ 50% while playing CS:GO
GPU Usage at ~ 40% while playing CS:GO

Edit: I rerun the benchmark and tried it with the Intel HD GPU unplugged and deactivated on BIOS:http://www.userbenchmark.com/UserRun/10102782
No difference

950ney,0,2018-08-06,White Female Hubris,TOROBAND,Braincels,https://www.reddit.com/r/Braincels/comments/950ney/white_female_hubris/,"This is not an AmA. I just need answers and I'm providing context.

I run a bug crush fetish business and have since 2013. We hire girls to step on insects. We also have both remote models and local models. So given that, we hire in person and online. Basically I've noticed a trend in how easy it is to hire women both irl and here on Reddit in order from easiest to hardest:

Non-white women &gt;&gt; eastern european white women &gt;&gt; Australian white women &gt;&gt; Southern white women &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Mainline western white women

The last group is who we are concerned with. This is an easy job and nothing to it It also pays quite well (possibly too much). We don't even allow nudity. Of all our models, 58% of them are non-white with the remaining 42% being mixed race, christian white conservative southerners, or Australian.

There is a reason for this that I have personally noticed. The 'mainline western white women' as I called them are caucasian females living outside of the US bible belt, Australia, or Eastern Europe as those seem to be the exceptions. The rejection rate, arrogance, and obnoxious nature of this group makes itself apparent and I will outline the two reasons below

&gt; **""I'm too cool""**

This is not explicitly said, but heavily implied by context and attitude. Although I have hired nurses, a future Google employee, honor students, etc but these women think themselves too high quality like most white women and scoff at the mere suggestion that they do anything for less than $1000/hr even if they are loser female NEETs on Discord

&gt; 
&gt; **I'm a vegan and bugs have feelings!!**

I've hired girls from a tiger conservatory (no joke), two vegans, and a veterinarian intern. Although most people seem to be aware that bugs do not even feel pain and don't have nociceptors. Not to mention we only use feeder insects anyways, they're bred to die.. This will not stop the emotionally charged western caucasian women from feeling otherwise. Why was I able to hire the aforementioned people? They weren't a part of the demographic we are discussing. 

This is not to say that others besides this group will say never say no, but when they do it is far more pleasant to deal with. They are not smug. They will not try to DDoS my site. They will not try to get me banned from wherever. They will not lecture me. They will not bait and switch. They will not play games. 

I am also not saying all women should run around doing bug smushing videos just because they're asked if they want to (still a good deal though). However, how you deal with things and respond to people shows what kind of person you are, whether you find it distasteful or not.

Why am I making this thread? Well people who browse this subreddit are either incels who are redpilled or honest normies. I'd like your two cents on why it is so hard to hire this demographic. Should I give up on even asking them anymore, or should I not generalize and consider possible exceptions you can make me aware of? 

God I hope this doesn't get deleted..."
950rw7,1,2018-08-06,Slow SQL queries,Maartin94,SQL,https://www.reddit.com/r/SQL/comments/950rw7/slow_sql_queries/,"Hi,

So I've got a task at hand to see if we would be able to speed up our report generation, I'll admit that I have only basic SQL skills but I do know how most of it works.

So we basically have a report generating software that sends SQL queries and creates reports from the results. 

When I start the report generation it takes about 30minutes to finish and we would like to reduce that time and now I'm trying to figure out the cause of the slow speed.

So I've been analysing the slowes queries and one of them is a ""tag"" that update its value once a second and stores that as one row of data, and the sent query retreives 4 rows for each day for a period of a month, which equals 120 rows. So a query like this usually take about 15 seconds, and I'm wondering if that is because there is 2.5million rows of data it goes trough just to get the result of 120 rows?

The report software sends thousands of queries like this in that half hour time it takes to generate the report.

So how would I speed up this? Is it just too much data? In that case it would be possible to create summary tags at maybe one hour intervals instead of going through those 2.5million rows it would be about 700 rows in a month. Would this be the solution or is there something else that slows it down?

I'm asking this as I'm helping investigate this in my internship while my colleague that gave me the task is on vacation, and is supposed to find some solutions for this.

Thanks in advance!"

I received a total of 303 responses (of which 290 were usable). The following are reasons that certain data was disregarded for purposes of this survey:

- Salary was in terms of hourly wage
- The result was for a non-public accounting position
- The result was given in terms of foreign currency
- The result was clearly too low to be taken seriously (ex: $5 for salary)
- The result was a joke

** I was on the fence about using this data as I believe the position was either incorrectly selected or the response was a joke. If not, whoever submitted this needs to ask for a raise.

**How to interpret this data:**

Each position's overall average salary is stated on the left of the graph. Different data subsets (average by department/firm size) are then averaged out on the right to be compared with the overall average. For example, if we look at 'High COL - Staff 1', the overall average salary for all people who fit into this demographic was $60,750. If we compare that to the average salary of people who were specifically in the audit department ($58,724) we can see that, on average, people in the audit department were paid less than the overall average in this survey.

Each position by applicable COL compares the overall average salary to the department and firm size of the people in that sub sample. If the category does not appear in the graph, no data was given for that particular result. 

#Bonus

[Bonus as a % of Salary](https://gyazo.com/817ab85f4eaaf67a780f35ff7f6fa3ec)

The results of the survey regarding bonuses was a little difficult to quantify. A significant portion of the responses indicated that they were currently unaware of the bonus they would receive (likely due to this survey being conducted well before year-end). As such, the results of the 'Bonus as a % of Salary' included only those individuals who reported their bonus, it does **not** take into account any of the people who reported no bonus/unsure of bonus.

I was wondering about the opportunities given at UTA for the CS department.

My current goal is to land a SWE internship for Summer 2019, like many fellow Mavs/College Students. I will be planning my first classes at orientation next week. My questions are

1) What Clubs/Orgs are good to join based on my interest? I couldn't find much on the Org Portal they have 

2) I've heard the math at UTA is quite challenging compared to that of TCC (Where I came from). How beneficial is having math taking at UTA than versus TCC to do well on the ML/CS courses?

951nkg,10,2018-08-06,"My fiance's father committed suicide not long after a dream about a creature:""It"" said she's is next",Xolotlitzquintli,ParanormalHelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParanormalHelp/comments/951nkg/my_fiances_father_committed_suicide_not_long/,"Okay so how do I start. My fiance has had a lot of past trauma (sexual,verbal, and physical abuse) which has caused her severe depression, suicidal thoughts, disassociation, and more. Her father suffered from Schizophrenia and ended up committing suicide when she was 18 years old (now 25). 

I've always been skeptical about her paranormal experience, but after being with her for 4 years with her immediate family also having experiences, and one of my own because of her, I have to be open minded. Especially for her safety. 

So she has always talked about seeing a dark figure since she was a child, and that it has popped up every now and then throughout her life. Her father had mentioned seeing the same thing. Right before her father committed suicide she told me that he had a dream he told to her about. In that dream a dark figure was chasing him, and caught up to him and killed him. As he was dying, he remembers that the creature than said it was coming for her next. She said he told her this dream only a few weeks or months before he committed suicide by hanging himself. 

We have gone to therapy and she is currently on ALOT of meds just so she can get through the day. She is the 1 person who has had problems with every mood stabilizer she has been prescribed and her psychiatrist is running out of options. Today I found a note she wrote that she is going to give to her therapist and I read it. She talks about how she doesn't feel happy anymore about anything, keeps hearing things and having suicidal thoughts, and just feels like giving up and every day is just hard. 

I don't know if this ""figure"" is a way for the brain to materialize and try to make sense of depression or schizophrenia or just a ""bad feeling"". Or if there truly is something weird going on... She's been tested for Schizo but isn't and so I just have no idea what to think.

A little bit about us: I'm a successful illustrator and game designer, I work every day and great things are coming out of my work, we have both finished art school, she currently has a great internship at an art museum, and we are saving up while living at my parents house while I'm getting my graphic novel published. So we aren't doing bad or are lazy people with too much time or reasons to be depressed or sad.

I know it sounds weird and I wouldn't believe it either, but seriously, that dream she told me about terrifys me. I don't know what to do. We have tried everything with medicine and therapy, but it's just not working and this ""dark figure"" seems like its really getting closer... metaphorically as in her depression and suicidal thoughts is getting worse, but could this thing really be ""A thing"" that is after her like her father said? 

If anyone can help or give advice about what to do, I would seriously appreciate it. I don't know what to do because all I can say is everything is going to be okay, but I know it's not because it's getting worst. This is all crazy to me honestly, but  I want to be open minded so I can figure something out. Please help us out with whatever tips, resources, or service. Please don't come at me with a bullshit you're wanting to sell. I need serious advice and tips.

TLDR: My fiance's father had a dream about a dark shadow creature killing him and then saying it was coming after my fiance. He committed suicide a couple of weeks after, and my fiances depression and suicidal thoughts have gotten worse since 8 years ago when it happened. I need advice or help since we have already tried therapy and psychiatrist."

Virtue House III:

-----


Virtue House has 3 basements but we keep the dungeon on the 58th floor just because we don't want to have a literal 'basement dungeon.' We're refined like that.

Typically you work on the 79th floor, next to me, the only one allowed into my office without a formal introduction. After all, you're the one who *makes* the formal introduction. How would you introduce yourself? I already know you, in and out.

In your 6 months as my compradora you've been to almost every other floor in Virtue House, from the technology division on 23, where you stood by my side as I gave a speech to the engineers thanking them for their work on our latest smartphone breakthrough (the vibration quality is fantastic. I tested it on you myself). You've negotiated deals on 50, the conference floor, working in stead of me, insisting I was quite very busy while I saw to clandestine and urgent arrangements with our hidden colleagues and investors. And you've rearranged offices on 40, hired a new batch of interns to work on floor 2, and fired nearly half of our medical supplies subsidiary on floor 33. Afterward you returned to my office on 79 and fell into my arms, trying your best not to spill tears on my Armani suit, but failing and knowing you'd take the punishment that came with your mistake.

I just rubbed your shoulders and pulled you into my lap. I'd fired people too, mi adora. People who did their best. Business is business, and we run the company.

There was no punishment that night. Only love and tenderness.

Tonight is different.

----

""You ignorant fucking *slut*!""

You cry out as the bullwhip's lash falls against your rear, cringing forward for a moment before fear overwhelms you and you stick out your ass again like I demanded, letting it quiver this time.

""King Hill is our biggest rival! Did you think they wouldn't put in an 11th hour bid?!""

They're not, and you did. King Hill only found out the terms of our deal with TechnoBid through a web of spies and bribery that you're still trying to untangle. You'd be working on that mystery literally right now if you weren't, well, tied up.

Literally tied up, with your wrists bound above your head, your ankles bound as well, tight by knots made in my hand and ropes made by our home-supply subsidiary. A blindfold slipped over your messy hair hides my angry visage from you. You tell yourself a gift. I've never made you this upset, and seeing me so distraught would make you cry for my pain.

I make my pain yours with another lash.

""300 million in projected *first-year* profits! How many cocks would you have to suck to make up the difference?!""

You've never been with any other man since you gave yourself to me. Yes, others have flirted with you. Some put hands on your wrist and your back. Even women, straight women, rich older women, want you, and aren't afraid to show it. You've gotten better at maniuplating social situations and rooms to avoid people, but you sleep easy at night knowing that with a simple sentence I can have those lechers reprimanded, demoted, fired, or killed.

You've let me do the former three before. We're still waiting on the latter. Maybe soon. Maybe never.

In any case - you're no whore. The furthest thing from.

But when my anger boils over, it crashes like magma down a mountain.

""I'm sorry, SIR!"" you shout, as the whip comes across your shoulder blades. ""I'll do whatever I can to -""

""Oh! So you want me to put you on the streets!"" My hot breath washes down the back of your neck. I pull your hair back hard, forcing your mouth open. ""Or are you blowing men in the private sector for me? Hm? Whose cock do you fantasize about having in this mouth?""

I stuff two fingers in and you automatically suck them with the perfection I've trained into you. *Yours,* you want to cry, *Yours Caudillo, only yours, I only dream of -*

""Puta,"" I rasp, spanking your ass hard until you finally have to yelp my fingers out of my mouth. I hiss, and you hang limp in your binds, humiliated, saliva dribbling down your chin, pussy juice flowing down your thighs.

""You're lucky your name is signed on the Compradora's Oath,"" I say, voice returning to its low, dark rumble. ""If anyone else missed something so obvious I'd have them fired.""

You didn't miss a thing. You warned me - subtly at first, then directly - that the TechnoBid CEO was a friend of King Hill's CFO from their Eton days. You showed me the pictures of the two of them on the soccer team. I told you it was called football (Fùtbol) and waved the issue away. In fairness I had 18 other more pressing matters on my desk, but you had a woman's awareness that a man would miss. I thought I'd won the TechnoBid CEO over with my charm and gallantry and back-slapping.

Some bonds just run too deep to be broken. I should know that best.

Perhaps I won't forget again. I'm the one who fucked up.

I can't fire myself. I can only resign as Caudillo, and, in the long-term, this is far from the worst thing a Caudillo has ever done.

Yet it's the first *major* mistake in our time together.

And it's the first time you've been on Floor 58.

More tools shift on benches behind you. Whips and floggers and paddles and perhaps even El Gato, the feared Cat o'nine tails built by my ancestor, Caudillo Jaime, 'El Bandito.' No one knows what he used it for except the highest-ranking members of Virtue House.

That is, you know.

And when I'm done with you, you'll know first-hand.

""Tell me you're sorry,"" I demand.

You do, fully believing that you did this, you deserve the punishment, and, worse, that you *want* to be punished.

You always wanted this.

To be owned by me for better or worse, for my love and my rage, which are really one in the same.

Just as you are eternally my beloved compradora - and my miserable, pathetic slave.

Here's how it's gone so far.

# BG1

[This is Nailah](https://i.imgur.com/4K1iO87.png), an Elvish MT.  I plan to have no use for Wisdom, Charisma would be augmented by the Ring of Charisma in BG2, and Constitution above a certain amount does nothing.  Everything else maxed.  Everything goes to finding traps until it's 100%, then stealth.  We will be stealthing quite a bit in the trilogy.  Starting spells are Blind and Sleep.

### Walkthrough

**Overview**: get XP fast enough to not get insta-killed by a bandit waylay.  To do this, grind until we have 1) a reasonable amount of HP and 2) access to some spells beyond first level like Mirror Image and Invisibility.  Then stealth through the entire game, picking up valuable items where possible, killing bosses as specified.


**Low Level Grinding**:

1. Buy a shortbow and 60 arrows and leave Candlekeep.

1. Run away from Imoen, unlocking the east map before running south to High Hedge.

1. Unlock Beregost, but then run west to kill Shoal for 5K XP.  Run to Beregost.

1. XP from Marl and Silke, using Blind on the latter before speaking to her.  Unlock the south map but go east to the Temple.

1. Stealth across the Temple map and unlock Mutamin's garden, but instead of going there go south of Beregost instead.

1. Run south to the Nashkel Mines map, stopping in Nashkel to get the Ankheg armor.  Get the Wand of Frost and run north to Mutamin's garden.

1. Use stealth to scout, Korax to walk distract Basilisks while the Wand of Frost takes them down.  Blind Mutamin before he can accost you, and try to finish him with arrows so you don't lose his items.

1. Continue taking out Basilisks until you lose Korax, then run to High Hedge.

1. Sneak in the building and buy Mirror Image and Invisibility.  Run to north of Beregost.

1. Sneak up north, then go around the Friendly Arm Inn to go north, snagging the Ring along the way.

1. Prepare Mirror Image and Blind.  Get right next to the south border and cast Mirror Image.  Rest.  Repeat until woken by an ankheg and cast Blind immediately.  If they save, run south then north to try again.  Otherwise, kill them with arrows and repeat, leveling up until you've got 20K XP total.

1. Stealth into the ankheg nest with Mirror Image up, grabbing everything and immediately casting Invisibility.  The Wand of Fire is the only important thing, but the other items are good for XP and gold that we'll want later.  Leave the nest, unlock the north map but go to the Nashkel Mines.

**Stealth Through Game**:

1. Invisibility through Naskhel Mines, deactivating traps as you go.

1. Blind Mulahey before he ever reaches you, then kill him with the Wand of Frost and arrows.  Try to finish him with arrows so you don't ice chunk his stuff.  Exit mines.

1. Steal the Potion of Invisibility, then get the Wand of Monster summoning the following way: A) memorize Invisibility, B) walk up to sarcophagus with the wand in it, C) grab wand and immediate walk to back of room, D) cast Invisibility on yourself.  The three ghasts should be shambling towards where they saw you last, allowing you to swiftly exit. DO NOT GET TRAPPED BY THE GHASTS.

1. Kill the mage in the south east with the Wand of Fire offscreen. Do the same for the adventurers in the north west, grabbing the Potion of Invisibility.

1. Swing by Nashkel for the Mulahey symbol XP, sell what you can at the store and exit east to Beregost.   Steal a Potion of Invisibility from the mansion.  Don't go near the main road where the assassin is waiting.

1. Blind Tranzig before killing him with arrows or a wand.  This will take a lot of resting, but fortunately you have the Ring of Wizardry and a 1 GB bed right downstairs.

1. Sneak to Bandit Camp and into the main tent.  Disarm the chest trap and grab the scrolls.  Cast Invisibility to sneak out.

1. If you have money, sell ‎Thalantyr the Wand of Fire and buy it back for 50 charges.  Otherwise, buy the Necklace of Missiles from the Carnival.  It comes with 10 charges at first, but 25 if you sell and buy it back.

1. Sneak all the way through Cloakwood, using a Potion of Invisibility if you're [waylaid by wyverns](https://i.imgur.com/vqZqYU8.jpg).  Hopefully you've stockpiled enough to get you through!

1. Get the Boots of Speed by shooting Fireballs from off screen with the wand or necklace.  Run through the mines all the way to Davaeorn, stopping only to pay 100 gold to free the slaves.  Use the back entrance to get into the jail cell and exit front after recasting Invisibility.

1. Disarm all of Davaeorn's traps, surround him with monster and get away.  Let him use all his spells on them.  After a while, surround him again and until wolves kill him.  Stay away from his spells; he should remain totally off screen.

1. Go to Baldur's Gate, using Potions of Invisibility to avoid Wyvern waylays. Accept Scar's offer to kill dopplegangers.

1. Buy a few Potions of Absorption and some way to get 100% fire resistance if you don't already have them.  Get scrolls of Knock, Otiluke's Resilent Sphere, Dispel Magic, Chaos and 2x Minor Globe of Invulnerability from Sorcerous Sundries and recharge anything you can afford to.  Go to the SW of the city.

1. Kill Dopplegangers with wands and report success to Scar.  Talk to the Duke and go to Candlekeep.

1. Run to the top of Candlekeep and go to jail.  In the caverns, deactivate the traps leading to the Tome of Strength.  Use the fire/electricity potions if you can't deactivate the traps, and even then use them anyway  :-)

1. Sneak past spiders, use Knock on the chest and get that 19 STR!

1. Sneak all the way out of the caverns and go back to Baldur's Gate.

1. Sneak up to the Duke and take him to the Harbormaster.  No need to fight the fake healer.

1. Go to north-central Baldur's Gate and then go east, stopping by Ramazith's tower to get the intelligence tome (Invisibility up, Invisibility down).

1. Go to the Blushing Mermaid and sneak to where Slythe is.  Make some monsters from the wand, put up your Mirror Image and lure Slythe back to the monsters and away from his wife.  Cast Invisibility immediately once he starts hacking and step back to safety, then kill him with the Wand of Fire.  Cast more monsters as necessary to keep him busy.  Grab the invites and exit.

1. Go to the palace and enter the rightmost door.  Fill the room with as many monsters will fit and cast Mirror Image.  Position them around the Dukes, then cast the resilient sphere on Liia Jannnath.  Let Belm talk, cast Chaos into the Dopplegangers then stand back and support the monsters chunking them using Haste and arrows.  Get teleported to the thieves den.

1. Grab the tome of dexterity and recharge anything you can afford.

1. Invisibility through the maze after protecting yourself from fire/lightning with items.  I still pause to disarm the traps around the skeleton warriors because old habits die hard.  BE CAREFUL OF THE TRAPS IN THE SECOND-TO-LAST-HALLWAY.  They need to be disarmed or could magic damage you to death.  Bad way to end a run, trust me.  Finish sneaking to the Temple of Bhaal.

1. Props goes to u/bloodweed for teaching me this.  Inside the Temple, throw a Dispel Magic at Sarevok from offscreen to disable his haste.  Then cast Minor Globe of Invulnerability on yourself and let him see you.  Lure him to the center of the room, then go Invisible.  Find the sweet spot on the floor that just continually trigger traps, and once you hit it recast Minor Globe just to be safe.  Stand there and wait for Sarevok to die.

[Here](https://i.imgur.com/N70uS0S.png) is how Nailah [and her gear](https://i.imgur.com/N2wHpYU.png) looks at the end of BG1.

# BG2

The upgrades from the BG1 engine to BG2 are welcome.  We exploit gaining XP from scribing and thieving, using the Z-button basically as a heal-all button and being able to remain paused on the inventory screen.  Since all proficiencies and skills are reallocated, put everything to picking locks and finding traps, since those get us XP first.  Proficiencies just require Quarterstaff; nothing else matters.

### Walkthrough

**Overview**: get the Staff of the Magi immediately out of Chateau I.  Sneak through the game past the Underdark, getting Use Any Item along the way.  Get the Shield of Balduran and grind Gauths under the Temple until Planetars happen.  Use Planetars to win game.

**Get Staff of the Magi**

1. Walk through CI using Invisibility, using Mirror Image and MMM to kill the mephit portals.  Get the Fire Wand and Cloudkill Wand and grab enough money/items for the next step.

1. Buy a Potion of Mastery Thievery or two to complement the one you got from the starter dungeon.  Steal 2x Scrolls of Protection from Undead, and 6x Scrolls of Skull Trap (3x from the scroll store, 3x from upstairs in the Adventurer's Market).

1. Speak with Gaelan and recharge your wands by stealing.  Go to the Docks and steal a Rogue Stone from Mae'Var's bookie.  Make sure your pick pocket is still high from the potions here because it's an insta-chunk if you botch it.

1. Go to the Bridge and memorize Mirror Image and as many Skull Traps as you can.  Best to also memorize Minor Globe.  Enter the Twisted Rune with the Rogue Stone.

1. Throw down all the Skull Traps from the scrolls and spells right around where the beholder shows up.  Trigger the conversation until the Lich teleports, then run towards the entrance and throw up a Protection of Undead as fast as you can.  **Cross your fingers and hope to hell the Skull Traps kill the Beholder**.  If not, use the Wand of Fire to hopefully finish the job, and then immediately use the second undead scroll to put back up your protection if the Dispel Ray brought it down.

1. Kill the unarmored fighter guy with literally anything.  Why is he even there?  Is he like an intern or something?

1. Walk up to Layene and run back immediately.  She'll waste a Time Stop if she can't find you.

1. Walk up to her again and run back to the Lich.  Layene will shoot a Meteor Swarm at you which stings but won't kill you.  Immediately run up the steps out of the area of effect.

1. A beautiful thing happens here.  The Meteor Swarm hurts the Lich, who then walks up to Layene and kills her for you!  Go get the SotM and whack the lich to death for XP.  Kill the vampire with the Wand of Fire if you don't mind a good chase.

1. Exit the Twisted Rune with staff in hand, knowing the game is 80% done.

**Sneak to Underdark**

The game is pretty self explanatory with the SotM in hand.  Just run through the chapters, adding all your proficiency points to picking pockets from now on.   Your main source of income is the cutpurse who sells scrolls at night in the west of the Bridge district.  Sell him wands and steal them back, making sure to also get his level 6 scrolls.  Use thief potions until your skill is innately high enough for this to not be a gamble.  Literally nothing at this point is hard if you're aware of the insta-death traps and always have a finger on F2 to activate the SotM.  Of course don't forget to rescue the Boots of Speed from Spellhold. 

**Underdark**

1. Steal the Light Gem from the duegar, then get turned into a drow, staying away from the invisible-seeing fish things.

1. As a drow, go back to the scroll salesman at the beginning of the level to steal better spells, including Mordenkainen's Sword.

1. Steal the Dragon Eggs and murder as many drow as you feel like.  My favorite way is to F3 to become visible, let them swarm me, then F2 and step away from the group, then Cloudkill mass murder them from offscreen.

1. Before going back to the dragon, memorize Death spell and put up a bunch of defenses and improved Haste.  When you teleport to the opening, cast Death to clear the path to the exit then run like hell.  There will be a parade of fish behind you that you need to get away from.

**Grind Gauths**

1. Back in Athkatla, get the Shield and go under the temple, completing the Eyeless Cult quest until you're in the beholder area.  I use the Simulacrum helmet and undead scroll to kill the lich for the Ring, later on.

1. Clear the beholder map, using Cloudkill for the human party and the Shield for everything else.

1. Level up to 6M XP by resting and letting Gauths kill themselves on you.  I had to do this some 220 times, but YMMV.  I got pretty efficient at it by finishing them with Flamearrow and using Z and Esc keys to rest quickly.

1. At 6M XP, memorize Planetar.

**Win Game**

With Project Image and Planetar, the game is over.  Even with only 2x level 9 slots, it's possible to get about 6x Planetars out in a relatively short time and clear a map, a dragon, a final boss, whatever.  I used Spike Traps for the first version of Irenicus and Planetars for everything else.

If you made it this far, here are [Nailah's final stats](https://i.imgur.com/WPbQBIz.jpg) and [equipment](https://i.imgur.com/VpkX0yK.jpg).  As you can see I finished the Ring of Gaxx quest but just about nothing else that wasn't just XP grinding.

Next stop is ToB, which TBH I'm kind of dreading because I'm already maxed out for XP and the game isn't really fun w/o progression, but I am very excited to try to use the Project Image/Spike Trap combo to kill the Ravager.  Planetars for everything else.  Thanks for reading!

Edit: forgot to mention, the pictures are from MtG cards.  The big picture is [Sorceress Queen](https://magiccards.info/scans/en/5e/56.jpg) and the small one is [Word of Command](https://magiccards.info/scans/en/cedi/45.jpg).  The idea was I wanted a picture of someone who looked like a magic-practicing rogue, but was basically invisible all the time.  I think these two nailed it."
952c9b,0,2018-08-06,Fresh graduate looking to attend language school and find work,Substantial_Anteater,movingtojapan,https://www.reddit.com/r/movingtojapan/comments/952c9b/fresh_graduate_looking_to_attend_language_school/,"Hello guys, I'm a fresh graduate from SEA (no working holiday visa) looking to improve my Japanese abilities (currently around N4 level, haven't taken JLPT though) and ultimately seeking employment in Japan. I have went there before and confirmed that I want to live and work there. I have a bachelor in Comp. Eng. and my interests/skills are primarily software/web development. I don't have work experience aside from an internship and a freelance project.

I have a plan in mind to go to a Japanese language school in Japan next year. The reason is because nowadays there are plenty of job expos or similar events that recruit ASEAN students to work in Japan (such as[ this](http://workjapan.nikkeihr.co.jp/en/)). However those events primarily target students or fresh grads within 3 years of graduation. If I study language in Japan for 1-2 years hopefully I can get decent language skills ( I can already recognize \~1000 kanji so I think that will speed it up a bit) and still get job opportunities as a fresh grad.

The other alternative plan I had is to work in my country for several years (probably 2-3?) while slowly working my Japanese. After I get to maybe N2 level I will then go to a language school in Japan to get N1 or higher. That way I will already have better Japanese language abilities and some work experience when finding for jobs in Japan.

Please note that I am not looking for a particularly high salary as even working part-time 4 hrs/day in Tokyo will earn me more than most full-time jobs in my country (as a fresh grad). Any kind of job is pretty much fine.

So, my question is which plan is more reliable for me to find work in Japan?  Is it harder to find a job in Japan as a fresher or an experienced worker (especially experience in software dev)?

Or what are your recommendations if there is any other way for me to set foot in Japan?"

I have around 7 months of total experience of dish-washing from culinary arts school and an internship at a lunch cafe, so I know the basics.

And what I want to do now is to impress some local restaurants with my work ethic and reliability, but I'm not really sure how exactly to do that other than always being on time and giving it my all. 

I'm going to work for a employment agency so I believe I will be changing restaurants regularly, so it's going to be a great opportunity to do some networking with the local businesses and that will hopefully help me get a chef job after I finish my culinary schooling. 

So do you guys have any tips? I always try to give it my best and I'm always on time and reliable, though I still think that there is some way that I could improve my performance but since I haven't really worked in a real kitchen, 

(We had a student restaurant that made food for real customers but we still had teachers watching over us and a really large workforce)  I don't really know some of the small things that I can do to impress my peers.

(Note: I know people here really dislike culinary art schools, but I live in Finland and you pretty much can't work in a professional kitchen unless you have gone to a state sponsored vocational schooling for a few years.)

Thanks."

First post here, but I greatly appreciate all the advice/info I've gleaned from the sub so far.  Look forward to being better able to contribute in the future.

I am heading into my 2nd clinical internship (8 wks at a SNF) and could really use some direction for material review.  When I spoke to the facility's rehab director, he told me I could see anything from post-op THR to stroke and to brush up on ortho, neuro, cardio, gait training, transfers, and bed mobility.  The breadth of these topics has left me a little overwhelmed and I wondered if anyone with SNF experience could help me narrow it down to what will be the most useful during my internship experience.  Further, if anyone can point me in the direction of some good, concise review materials for these topics, I will be forever indebted to you!

I was able to pull a few neuro topics from a previous post re: a neuro hospital internship (https://www.reddit.com/r/physicaltherapy/comments/33bm3w/neuro_question_what_neuro_material_should_i/) and I will certainly be reviewing them and taking some time to review OSullivan.

I am so so grateful for any additional suggestions or ideas."
952kte,22,2018-08-06,Didn’t get offer due to review by senior,Blueballs4lyfee,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/952kte/didnt_get_offer_due_to_review_by_senior/,"Audit internship ended recently and during my exit interview I was informed that I would not be getting an offer. They cited one of the reviews I received by the senior on a 2 week engagement I was on. I recieved 3 total and the other two were above average I would say. The bad review was by a senior that is well liked in the office.

The senior noted that I should be more engaged while I was being explained the tasks. I always had my notepad with me and took notes of everything. They also said there were a handful of tasks which I didn’t completely on time but that I improved on this in my second week. In my first week I was still getting used to the software we used and the general process of how things worked on the engagement, so I thought I would get some slack on this. But most of the times I asked how long I should spend on tasks I was told to “work at my own pace.”

This was my first audit internship and everything was new to me and I was only on that engagement for two weeks. I feel pretty discouraged about not receiving an offer and I thought I wouldn’t have to go through another recruiting cycle again. 

This is more of a venting post but any comments or thoughts would be appreciated."

Ive had a couple interviews but never got chosen. I’ve been applying to jobs across the country but mostly trying to get one near home so that I can live at home or live near home. 

It worries me that I don’t know how long I will be unemployed for after this internship and it makes me insecure/feels like I’m falling behind that my friends and former class mates are already starting their careers and making good cash and I’ve only made a few thousand dollars

It worries me more that if I got a job I will be living in a different state by myself. I lived on my own this internship in a studio apartment and it was awful but I have no idea how i would find a roommate who is also looking for a place to live in the same area or the same work as me. Everyone I know seems to be rooming with people they know.

And to be completely honest I don’t even know how to cook decent meals. My dad would make me a weeks worth of pasta over the weekend that I take back with me to have lunch for work then I typically get take out for dinner 
(I don’t have a kitchen in my studio. I can probably start trying to cook at home on my own with my dads help while looking for a job )

I have such high hopes and dreams of where’d id like to see myself in 5 years but how I’m going to get there is much harder than I’m imagining and making me feel hopeless. I know this is part of the whole “welcome to reality” phase but all my life i seem to makes everything harder or more of a struggle to overcome or complete than what a normal person could do 

I’m currently sitting here st work  feeling unmotivated, sad, and anxious about the future
I truly don’t know how I’m going to make it. And this is just the basic adult hood part
The being social/trying to talk women part  is gonna be a whole other issue to tackle

I feel like I’m going to be struggling a lot all by myself. 
I seem to be the only one who feels this way out of the people I know so it hard to admit it or talk about it in person 
I’m expecting the majority of people who read this will agree/say that this isn’t normal, I’m doing something wrong, and I’m falling behind and will be struggling a lot 

I just don’t know

I really need some advice here as it'd be greatly appreciated! Long post ahead, sorry!


Anyways, my boyfriend and I have been dating for 1.5 years now. In the beginning, everything was amazing. We never fought or complained - in fact, the only thing we ""fought"" about was convincing each other that we actually have want to pay for each other's meal. Anyways, last year October, I finished an internship and started a new job at a corporate sales position. 


Long story short, I cried almost everyday due to the stress and tried to quit about 4 times in the last year. My boyfriend's been supportive of me whenever I broke down crying, telling him that I can't take the stress anymore and being with me while I burnt out. I've tried looking for other jobs, but to no avail. I have a place that I'm renting and I need to pay the monthly bill, hence that's why I haven't quit yet.. I feel trapped honestly.


Anyways, this lead to me being in a great depression whenever I saw my boyfriend on weekends and it was obvious. He had burnout and he was always trying to make me feel better. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't always down and I tried to be the best girlfriend I could be, even with depression. I bought him gifts, cheered him up when he was down and did surprises lately.


Cut to yesterday, I woke up to him sitting on the couch, and he just breaks down crying saying that he's happy but at the same time he's not. I knew automatically what it meant. He said how he felt drained because he felt like he always had to be there for me. I agreed 100 percent. I ended up talking for an hour straight (yes, I'm a talker lol) and had this crazy ephiphany about how my depression came in between us, and I looked back on all of my past wrongs. It was mind-blowing... I realized how much I hated my work and how my depressive thoughts kept someone I loved so much from being happy. Our weekends would literally be me sulking over work and laying in bed.. I knew that girl wasn't me and I could be alot better.


Anyways, I told him that I want to change, I'm going to quit my job somehow and focus on my depression and overcoming it. He then looked like  he was happier but still confused. I asked him for another chance and he seemed weary to which I told him he's free to make whatever choice he wants.. he said yes thankfully :)


But my question here is... Am I doing the right thing asking to get back together with him? I should be happy but I'm not because I'm scared he only said yes out of pity..I want to feel like he's happy with this outcome too. I can't explain it bit, how do I feel like he's happier being with me? Am I being selfish for wanting another chance? Sorry if it's a bit confusing..any advice would be amazing.


I did ask him he says he is but his demeanor said otherwise...


Tldr; boyfriend almost broke up with me but didn't after I told him I'll change (which I will). Am I being selfish for holding on to this relationship?

Abruptly ending GIAW's reign on top, Charli XCX's recent single, 'Girls Night Out', takes our hot-shot debut, with almost 2,000 total points, more than double Ariana's 3rd week, 'God is a Woman'. 

This week's chart sees a large abundance of debuts, The Chainsmokers' /r/popheads favorite, 'Side Effects' boasting a number 3 debut, followed closely by Tinashe's 'Throw a Fit'. Charli XCX rounds out our top 5, with 'No Angel' receding one spot. 

Outside of the top 5, Brockhampton and Robyn both lodge lofty debuts, and Charli XCX holds tight to the top 10 for a third entry with 'Focus'.

##How The Chart Works:

These charts are created based on how frequently each song appears in the top 10 songs/albums for all of the users signed up for the chart. If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurrence, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for the last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each.

On the issue itself, I am working with Internet Explorer because I have to since the company's application I am supposed to be creating test scripts for is a browser application that only runs in IE. 

My main issue that I am having at this point is that I cannot manage to change window focus when a new window is opened, which is necessary to what I need to be testing.

I have tried multiple different ways for changing what window is being focused on, and have gotten one way to work in Chrome so I do not believe that my code itself is the problem. The IE settings are locked into place by the company, and the security settings for the Internet zone is Medium-High and protected mode enabled. 

If anyone could recommend any fixes to circumventing this roadblock it would be very helpful. I am using the latest version (3.13) of the 32 bit IE Driver, and I writing the scripts in java within Eclipse IDE.

Thanks

953pe2,2,2018-08-06,Nowhere/one to talk to anymore...,mocha-coffee,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/953pe2/nowhereone_to_talk_to_anymore/,"Its almost 2AM at the time of writing this but I have no where else to go anymore to contain these feelings and tears are slowly rolling off my eyes as I type this...

My then girlfriend broke up with me last December while on a long distance relationship of half the world around. We were supposed to meet just a few week or 2 later in January... I wasnt given a very clear answer on why we broke off but right after the phone call where she broke it off I couldnt comprehend what happened except the fact that we’re no longer in a relationship...

She graduated last year May where I still had to stay until the end of this December. We had a clock ticking when this relationship started as things were uncertain for international students in the US and we were from different country in the world... but after she graduated and return we kept in touch, and thus the long distance relationship started, things were hopeful...

She was the very first person who love me as much more, no. Even more than I did to every one else in my life. 

I found out she removed me from her social media, “meh, whatever I thought” 

Feelings hit me real hard around April and May during the busiest weeks of the semester. The only reason I survived that hell week of the semester was by drowning myself with final exams and projects, burning out myself until I collapse in bed. Else I just kept on working. 

Once the finals ended, I saw cheap tickets to her country almost bought then but sent a text to her asked how she was doing...
...
She started seeing someone, someone who is much more capable than me, top university, prestigious career, much more stability something that I dont have... obviously I didnt bought the ticket then...

 I cried again, I cry myself to sleep for lots of nights...

I want to be happy for her, but yet I’m sad, devastated... I got an internship in a country near her home country, yet we dont talk, its as if someone who was the most important person in your life passed away... she’s there, yet she’s not... people have come and gone in my life, I’ve accepted it as a fact of life since 15, everyone is temporary... yet I let my guard down... she too, left...

5-7 years ago I told myself to not ask for the “what ifs” as they have already passed, theres nothing I can do and just keep moving onwards, and yet these pass few months all the “ifs” and “what ifs” lingers... there are a lot of self anger and self hatred, “I’m weak” “I’m not good enough?” “What did I do wrong?” So many questions with no answers, whatever I say or do will not change anything...

Now if you’ve read this far... I’m not asking for pity, I know theres more to life, and one day I’ll hopefully be able to love myself and learn to be happy by myself... yet the thought of losing someone whom I love so dearly has vanished from my life... 

I was assured by my mentor whom I look up to, asked him, “have you been through a heartbreak before?” “Lets go get coffee” he said... conversation went by, I got great advice and life lessons... but I’m still in the process... 

Whomever you are... thank you for reading this far..."
953so7,27,2018-08-06,Drama in r/france,dogDroolsCatsRules,Drama,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drama/comments/953so7/drama_in_rfrance/,"Drama in r/france over a mod demonding other mods.

So, effort posting is my greatest ennemy, so I am just going to copy paste in deepL the [timeline](https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/951q9m/l%C3%A9tat_de_la_mod%C3%A9ration/).

Hi, everybody,

A priori we have to do com', nobody pushes himself to do it at home so I stick to it. We see all the crazy theories so I'll try to be exhaustive, for transparency's sake!

You noticed some time ago the wild demod of /u /hycanlox. This will be our starting point for this story which I hope will make your Monday.

Chapter I : RIP Hyca

So a little over a month ago, it was the middle of the day, surprise! A message for everyone: Hyca finds himself demod by /u /Stereo.

A brief explanation follows, after multiple complaints against the interested party and a consultation between ""former"" moderators, Hyca finds herself unemployed on the interns. The rest of the team didn't agree with the form of this decision, not necessarily on the substance, so we got together (yes I am illiterate daredevil) to put the points on the i.

A debate is therefore organized as a first step, to see what the grievances are. To summarize, it turns out that Hyca has an unfortunate tendency to go back behind colleagues to reverse their moderation decisions in addition to having a communication that is at the very least expeditious, if not totally aggressive with the rest of the team. Is this enough for demod a mod? That is the question that was put to the vote, whether or not she should be reinstated. After a good two weeks of nothing at all because of a tie in the vote (and incidentally the former moderators totally afk) and a record abstention, some of us decided to change our vote to unblock the situation.

Chapter II: nothing at all.

Yes, during these two weeks we were able to see several problems within the moderation. It turns out that our private conversations, especially our debates, are leaking elsewhere on the internet. We're not going to lie to each other, it doesn't create a crazy atmosphere when we know that everything we say is susceptible to leak. We can still see this today, with screens to pull the trigger... Finally.

Chapter III: Hyca's reintegration

The vote has spoken, Hyca is back in and we are working relatively normally. Right up to the big drama. Another leak, a long debate, a modmail and a confession! u /afrofagne admits having transmitted private information to others... BOOM, the sentence falls, Stereo punches, he demod afrofagne. The team remains in shock, /u /frensoaria admits in turn... Second shot. Confusion sets in. What does Stereo do? we try to talk about it, unfortunately many moderators are on holiday or on the move... We're looking for a compromise... Unfortunately no, nothing gets through, the parties no longer want to work together.

Chapter IV: the root of the problem and the current drama

As you can see, we have a team problem. There are clans in moderation, the team is not united and if it stayed there, we could always work together. Unfortunately, it doesn't stop there and Stereo decided unilaterally to part with two historically loved moderators for these stories.

Why Stereo? He has been moderating the sub for over 7 years, reddit works like this, there is a hierarchy induced by seniority. Nobody can demod it in the state and its decisions find their justifications in :

    Confessions of the interested parties
    The team's inability to work normally, cohesively and consistently

He wanted to punch his fist, and show his shaving bowl with this atmosphere that continues in moderation. Yes because, know it, there was a recruitment of moderators because it is precisely this nazy atmosphere which made the elders flee.

PS: I could see a screen breaking here or there from a private conversation where I say ""if we say everything, we'll get run over"". Well, we say everything, it's not exciting, it's just a team that can't work together. It's particularly a shame for Frenso with whom I loved working and Afro who was an excellent contributor, but I at my level couldn't do much.

PS: we fire the other ""megathread"" you will have here a relatively official version at the general request, if I am wrong or I forget things it is possible, and you will have understood it even we, as good wankers, we do not agree on X version, so I have done something relatively neutral. I invite those interested to express their POV, no worries. And please, stay cordial, an internal drama shouldn't trigger so much hatred on the sub, it's a shame for everyone this story, especially the poor mods who didn't ask anyone and who see their workload triple on a Monday for something not very interesting.

Edited for the pings."

954edw,4,2018-08-06,My [23F] boyfriend [23M] of 1.5 years is clueless about his finances,mette3518,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/954edw/my_23f_boyfriend_23m_of_15_years_is_clueless/," About  me (23F) - graduated in May, starting grad school this month, no  student loans/debt. I was very fortunate to receive scholarships for school and have parental support with living expenses during undergrad. I was also raised to be very financially conscious and growing up my family always talked about money.

My  boyfriend (23M) of 1.5 years is in a different situation. He just finished his 4th year of school and has two more to go (doing a combined  bachelors/masters). He has told me his family has taken out student loans for his education, and he also owes money to his grandparents/parents for living expenses/car/study abroad. We are  attending schools in different states, long-distance, and we just spent  the summer living together for internships. (It was amazing!)

The  main issue I'm experiencing is that my boyfriend knows nothing about his loans. He said his parents always handled paying his school bills  and didn't really involve him in the process. He can't even guess at the  amount he owes. This really bothers me as I am 100% aware of my  financial situation and always trying to plan for my future.

Lately  I've been talking with him about this more. I told him that I don't  care how much he owes  - I'm not going to break up with him over a certain amount.  But I told him it really bothered me that he doesn't  know how much he owes, and  doesn't seem to care. I told him this was a  big red flag for me, as it indicates he won't be able to handle future  things like buying a home. When the subject comes up his usual response  is that his parents always told him not to worry about money, they  would handle  it. He feels that he is powerless in this situation -  since he is still in school, the loan payments are postponed so why  should he care now?  He is committed to finishing his degree so the amount of loans don't matter, he says -  they are what they are.

He  has been taking steps to find out his loan situation, but his parents  seem hesitant to tell him. Just today, he was asking his dad about the loans,  and his dad sent him a list of what my boyfriend owes them (his parents) for living expenses, etc (no student loans tho). When my BF followed up about the student loans his dad said he didn't know and  would need to ask his mom.

His family seems to do okay financially. They just put in a pool and they are paying for me to go on vacation with them this winter. My boyfriend  seems to feel like they have it under control. But I can't help but have a feeling of dread. Thinking that he probably owes thousands of dollars, our future lives will be constrained by loan payments, it all makes me feel sick to my stomach.

I'm seeking advice on how to handle this and help my boyfriend. He says he doesn't even know how to find out how much he owes - this can't be true, right? What are the main things he needs to know about loans?  Obviously he needs to focus on paying the student loans back first, not  so much his family loans (no interest on those)? Is there anything he  should be doing now to get ahead on his loans coming due in two years?  How do you think this will affect being together long-term? And what reason would his parents have for keeping this from him - he thinks they don't want to worry him. 

I appreciate any advice. I believe my BF is willing to learn as our past conversations about money have gone well. And to his credit, I feel he has made good financial decisions otherwise - he went to a community college  for 1 year before attending an in-state school, he's always working, driving an old car, and is frugal with his spending.

Also - we have a great relationship. He is my best friend and I want to  spend the rest of my life with him. I also really like his family and overall everything (except this) is a great match. Any advice on how to get on the same page is much appreciated.

P.S.  - I know there have been situations where the parents are misleading  their kids about their loans and misusing the money. I truly don't think that's what's happening here but I'm aware that it could be.

**tl;dr My boyfriend doesn't know the amount of his student loans and I'm worried. How can we get on the same page financially?**"
954my4,19,2018-08-06,Money and friends are a bad bad combination.,tiddlywinks10,weddingplanning,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/954my4/money_and_friends_are_a_bad_bad_combination/,"My bachelorette weekend is coming up and back in May I booked an 8 person suite at a nice beach hotel for all of us to stay at. I pre-paid for the room personally (around $1400) so that we could get a discount for booking early and confirm our reservation. A beach hotel in August books up pretty quickly around here so I grabbed the room while it was available. Originally all 7 girls rsvp'd yes and we were planning on splitting the cost between all of us, which would have been within everyones budget (confirmed this with them several times). One person had to cancel their rsvp a couple weeks later due to a work event that they can't miss. Bummed they can't make it but they let us know as soon as possible and its not ideal but its fine. The price per person went up, but still within everyones budget to split 6 ways. It worked out to be around $230/person for the weekend. I know that's a lot for a couple of the girls, but that is literally the ONLY expense for the trip. Everything else is basically included besides what they order if/when we go out. The whole weekend is just supposed to be beach/pool time, and I've already shopped &amp; packed more than enough booze, snacks, and meals for the weekend so they won't have to expense for that. I'm driving there, so they don't have to worry about gas. I already have all the cheesy games and decorations from being MOH at other bachelorette weekends. So honestly, all they are expected to pay for is their share of the hotel. [Side note: If it sounds like I'm throwing myself my own bachelorette weekend, that's because I am. I love my friends to death, but they are the very definition of procrastinators and I honestly could not trust them to throw a successful event if it saved their lives. I'm also a biiiiit of a control freak and like to know whats going on.] Probably fair to point out that I make more than I think all of them, so I'm fine with covering a bigger portion of the weekends expenses BUT they've had over 3 months to pay me back for the hotel, AND they all confirmed they were comfortable with the cost back in May. No one has paid me back still but I'm trying not to get too annoyed until the weekend has past and we'll see where everyone stands. Best part, my future SIL told me TODAY that she can't come. She has a new internship in a different city and she doesn't want to fall behind by missing ONE DAY. So we started with 7 at $200/person, then to 6 at $230/person, and now down to 5 people. I don't think it's fair at all to have the 5 people left now have to pay $280 each and I would never ask that of them. But I don't really want to eat the $230 that my future sister in law is bailing out on, but based on the conversations we had, shes not going to pay $230 for a weekend that shes not even a part of. $230 isn't worth starting a fight over, but I am trying to plan and pay for a wedding over here sooooo what to do?

To answer my own question/rant I guess I'm going to eat the $230 ($460 total, assuming the other girls ever pay me back). I know I took on this risk when I booked the room ahead of time without actually getting payments from the other girls first, but I was giving them the benefit of the doubt that they'd follow through on their commitments. At the time I didn't want to spring an ""unexpected"" cost on them and thought giving them time to come up with the money would be helpful. It sucks that this is causing so much stress and already putting a cloud over what should be an exciting weekend. What I would really love is just telling them that it's off and taking future husband on a nice beach getaway instead. 

TLDR: Bridesmaid (Future SIL) bailed on bachelorette weekend, not sure how to cover her share of the costs. Tired of all of this, want to run away. "

**Interview # 4: Lindsay Buescher, Marketing Manager at Lisk**
*By Yanis - August 6, 2018 - 5:40 pm* 


&amp;nbsp;


It has been several months since part of the Du Coin team has been following the progress of the Lisk project. After introducing the project as an article, we recently had the pleasure of talking with the brilliant Lindsay Buescher, Marketing Manager at Lisk. This interview is an exclusive Journal Du Coin, made possible thanks to the accessibility of the LiskHQ / Lightcurve team that I want to personally thank for the professionalism they have shown since the beginning of our exchanges.


&amp;nbsp;


*Hello Lindsay Buescher , and thank you for this interview! Can you briefly
introduce yourself and Lisk ?*


&amp;nbsp;


My pleasure! Thank you for reaching out. I began working at Lightcurve as a Marketing
Manager exactly one year ago. My professional background spans over 10 years with a
special focus on performance marketing. You could say blockchain has taken over my
life, so I do spend a fair amount of time researching projects in my spare time. Having
been interested in crypto and blockchain for several years, I joined Lisk as I saw an
opportunity for the project to solve scalability challenges faced by other platforms. Lisk is
a blockchain application platform based on its own network and token (LSK) offering a
framework for developers to easily build and deploy custom dapps. What makes Lisk
unique from other blockchain application platforms lies in the ability for developers to
customize their own blockchain as a sidechain.


&amp;nbsp;


*First tricky question: do you know the website ""Le Journal du Coin"", which deals, in
French, about cryptocurrency and blockchain technology?*


&amp;nbsp;


I’ve actually been familiar with Le Journal du Coin for quite a while since we have many
community members based in France and Belgium. Although I studied French for four
years in high school, my ability to understand everything I read in French is a topic for
another discussion.


&amp;nbsp;


*The LiskHQ teams have recently moved to new a location, and your new
offices can now accommodate hundreds of people. Should we expect to see your
membership grow again this year?*



&amp;nbsp;


Yes, that is correct. We moved into a brand new office within the
WeWork Atrium Tower in Berlin that accommodates 160 people. To give you a better
impression of our growth, eight new employees were onboarded in the month of July and
there are at least nine more employees in the pipeline to start in August and September.
Our hiring goals are quite ambitious as we hope to increase the Lightcurve headcount to
at least 80 by December.


&amp;nbsp;



*You have been one of the first to implement an alternative to the proof of work
consensus (PoW) called the delegate proof of stake (DPoS). Could you please explain us this
choice?*


&amp;nbsp;



It is often argued that DPoS is the next step in the evolution of consensus protocols by
drastically increasing speed and scalability of blockchains. These are two important
factors for Lisk because we are building a blockchain application platform for dapps to
scale.
Not only can DPoS be a more democratic system, but it also has the capability to be
more efficient in terms of speed and energy usage. When it comes to speed, DPoS
systems are much faster than traditional PoW and PoS systems. For example, the
selection of block producers allows for transactions on Lisk to be validated in 10
seconds, rather than 10 minutes on Bitcoin’s PoW system. Energy efficiency is another
strong case for choosing DPoS when comparing the costs and environmental impact
that is often criticized with PoW hashing algorithms.
Consensus protocols are highly sensitive and heavily debated in the industry. I’m happy
to say that these discussions are stimulating innovation at Lisk where our dedicated
Science Team (Iker, Jan and Andreas) is working to optimize our DPoS consensus
protocol.


&amp;nbsp;


*The release of the new Lisk Core 1.0 is one of the greatest achievements of your
development teams! Could you reveal your roadmap for future developments?*


&amp;nbsp;


It certainly is the milestone we’ve all been anticipating. Lisk Core is the application that
implements the protocol, enabling participation in the network. Many significant changes
come with Lisk Core 1.0 including, but definitely not limited to the completely new and
improved Lisk API.
Max, Oliver, the development team and the science team are preparing the product
development roadmap, which will be revealed and communicated transparently after the
release of Lisk Core 1.0.

*Recent developments have required months of work. Do you think that
communication on more modest goals isn’t a more agile alternative?*



&amp;nbsp;


You are absolutely right. Several valuable lessons were learned with the release of Lisk
Core 1.0. Internally we have already made structural changes on the team to
accommodate a more agile development approach. From a communications
perspective, it is very important to us to keep our community up-to-date about our
development progress and for that reason we have a weekly development update on the
Lisk Blog . After Core 1.0, the development team is planning bi-weekly release cycles
with a minor release every other week. The upcoming development roadmap will reflect
a prioritized list of feature rollouts and protocol optimizations.


&amp;nbsp;


*Transaction fees are currently of 0.1 LSK per transaction. The cost to improve our
Lisk wallet security is 5 LSK. We are talking about dynamic fees and a change in the
registration fees. Would you like to tell us more?*


&amp;nbsp;


Iker Alustiza, from our Science Team, has revealed his strategies for the dynamic fee
system on Lisk’s subreddit . Until Lisk Core 1.0 is released to mainnet, I cannot reveal
more at this point in time.


&amp;nbsp;


*What is your view of the actual use cases of blockchain applications? In your
opinion, is the technology mature enough to be adopted by the big industry?*


&amp;nbsp;


We are still in the nascent stages of blockchain real world usage. As a reality check, the
top five dapps on Ethereum are averaging 1,244 daily active users and 17,603 monthly
active users as of today. We are far from mainstream adoption, but despite that, there
are plenty of breakthroughs taking place. For example, IBM is using blockchain to
monitor carbon offsets in China and the National Agency of Public Registry is storing
land registry titles in Georgia on the blockchain.
The blockchain industry is not quite mature enough for widespread adoption, however,
several enterprises such as IBM , SAP and Microsoft are already offering blockchain
solutions. I would argue that two of the biggest hurdles for enterprises adopting
blockchain today are legacy infrastructures and the legal complexities of regulations.

The blockchain industry is not mature enough to be widely adopted, however, several companies like IBM, SAP and Microsoft already offer blockchain solutions. I would say that two of the biggest hurdles for today's blockchain companies are the existing infrastructure and the legal complexity of regulation.


&amp;nbsp;


*Have you ever been contacted by firms that would like to start developing on Lisk
Blockchain? If so, can you tell us more?*


&amp;nbsp;


Yes, we receive many inquiries every week and that is one of the (many) reasons why
we are building out a Business Development team at Lightcurve.



&amp;nbsp;


*Last question but not least. During the Lisk Relaunch event last February,
we were able to see employees of the Kraken company. Exclusively for the ""Le Journal
du Coin"" website and for the French speaking Lisk community, can you confirm that this
Exchange will list soon the LSK token on its platform?*


&amp;nbsp;


Lisk has had ongoing conversations with a few of the major exchanges that we're not
currently listed on. Kraken is one of those exchanges. Some of these exchanges may be
waiting for the Lisk Core 1.0 release to mainnet in order to avoid the migration.
As mentioned above, we are building out a Business Development team who will also be
responsible for managing exchanges. We currently have a business development intern who
has made great progress in the last month streamlining communication channels and setting
up a structure for the team.



&amp;nbsp;


*Thank you Lindsay for taking the time to answer our questions, thank you also to Mat and Liskpro for making this interview possible.*

I've never been SUPER skinny, and my mom never failed to tell me that every single day. Everyday she tells me I'm fat, ugly, stupid, achieved nothing in my life, unable to do anything, waste, disappointment etc... list goes on and on. When she yells at me, she doesn't stop until I am in tears, and even then she keeps going and laughs even. She blamed everything in her life on me, and anything inconvenience she would take it out on me, including her marriage. My dad cheated on her multiple times, he wasn't around that much. Now hes 60, hes still talking to another woman, but hes getting old so he expects his child to be nice to him. All the trauma they caused me still greatly affects me.

in highschool, I was obsessed with counting calories, i hated myself every day and I was skinnier. I was constantly dieting, exercising, and I would wake up because I want to throw up due to starvation.Even through this, my mom called me fat everyday and said i'm disgusting, no one will want me etc... fast forward, im in college. 22 years old, and i have gained around 15 lbs.

she still does that, and you would think that after all this time i would stop taking it personally, but i still do. Yesterday she went on another rampage and said i should be ashamed of how I am, that I have no accomplishments, and I look like shit. She said this in a restaurant and people around heard. I just wanted to disappear.

Even though I gained weight, sometimes I feel okay about myself. And sometimes I am okay with how I am now, but every time I make any progress its all gone. I am trying to get a new job at a better company, and my dad said you should lose some weight its shameful for you to look like that working somewhere nice. arent you embarrassed?

Mymoms rampage yesterday pushed me off the edge, and I could feel my younger self crying her eyes out inside. and I could feel any motivation to do well disappearing. My friend then told me, oh you should try to eat healthier and lose some weight its just your legs are fat. and today when I  went out, I saw a old friend and she was just like ""are you the same person? i didn't recognize you at all?"" ""why do you look so sad? whats wrong with you?"" 

After hearing more shit about my appearance, I went home and saw that I might be kicked out of the internship program due to my GPA. In my initial years in college, I had a really hard time and got onto academic probation, and it affected my GPA.

I have so many bills to pay, not enough money. I don't earn enough. And my friends comment about how I should save my money. I don't want to do this anymore. I do want to lose weight, but I never had a reason other than superficial and being miserable cause of my mom. 

I am miserable now. the only one on my side is my boyfriend who says I don't need to lose weight, and I am fine now, but he is also getting tired of hearing me complain over the same things. and im sure he is also sick of my attitude.

i don't have any motivation or clue where i should go. whats the point of life?"
956hzl,0,2018-08-06,"My fiance's father committed suicide not long after a dream about a creature:""It"" said she's is next",Xolotlitzquintli,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/956hzl/my_fiances_father_committed_suicide_not_long/,"I was told to post here from my post in the r/paranormalhelp forum so hopefully I can find help here.

Okay so how do I start. My fiance has had a lot of past trauma (sexual,verbal, and physical abuse) which has caused her severe depression, suicidal thoughts, disassociation, and more. Her father suffered from Schizophrenia and ended up committing suicide when she was 18 years old (now 25).

I've always been skeptical about her paranormal experience, but after being with her for 4 years with her immediate family also having experiences, and one of my own because of her, I have to be open minded. Especially for her safety.

So she has always talked about seeing a dark figure since she was a child, and that it has popped up every now and then throughout her life. Her father had mentioned seeing the same thing. Right before her father committed suicide she told me that he had a dream he told to her about. In that dream a dark figure was chasing him, and caught up to him and killed him. As he was dying, he remembers that the creature than said it was coming for her next. She said he told her this dream only a few weeks or months before he committed suicide by hanging himself.

We have gone to therapy and she is currently on ALOT of meds just so she can get through the day. She is the 1 person who has had problems with every mood stabilizer she has been prescribed and her psychiatrist is running out of options. Today I found a note she wrote that she is going to give to her therapist and I read it. She talks about how she doesn't feel happy anymore about anything, keeps hearing things and having suicidal thoughts, and just feels like giving up and every day is just hard.

I don't know if this ""figure"" is a way for the brain to materialize and try to make sense of depression or schizophrenia or just a ""bad feeling"". Or if there truly is something weird going on... She's been tested for Schizo but isn't and so I just have no idea what to think.

A little bit about us: I'm a successful illustrator and game designer, I work every day and great things are coming out of my work, we have both finished art school, she currently has a great internship at an art museum, and we are saving up while living at my parents house while I'm getting my graphic novel published. So we aren't doing bad or are lazy people with too much time or reasons to be depressed or sad.

I know it sounds weird and I wouldn't believe it either, but seriously, that dream she told me about terrifys me. I don't know what to do. We have tried everything with medicine and therapy, but it's just not working and this ""dark figure"" seems like its really getting closer... metaphorically as in her depression and suicidal thoughts is getting worse, but could this thing really be ""A thing"" that is after her like her father said?

If anyone can help or give advice about what to do, I would seriously appreciate it. I don't know what to do because all I can say is everything is going to be okay, but I know it's not because it's getting worst. This is all crazy to me honestly, but I want to be open minded so I can figure something out. Please help us out with whatever tips, resources, or service. Please don't come at me with a bullshit you're wanting to sell. I need serious advice and tips.

TLDR: My fiance's father had a dream about a dark shadow creature killing him and then saying it was coming after my fiance. He committed suicide a couple of weeks after, and my fiances depression and suicidal thoughts have gotten worse since 8 years ago when it happened. I need advice or help since we have already tried therapy and psychiatrist."
957g60,217,2018-08-06,The Tale of Greaseface (screenshots of today's roast included),CastielGalafran,JustNoSO,https://www.reddit.com/r/JustNoSO/comments/957g60/the_tale_of_greaseface_screenshots_of_todays/,"Alright y'all. I've been sitting on this one for a while. I was so busy with the Saga of AnimeAssassin and ranting about Doge that I'd forgotten all about this scrub.

Allow me to fix that.

Once upon a time I was a wide eyed college freshman. I was abundantly unaware of the fact that I was at all attractive and felt extremely insecure that I'd never had a boyfriend. I felt that if I was worthy of love I'd have found it by now, and at the ripe old age of 18/19 my shot at it was long past. So, full of angst but also that thrilling excitement of being on a big college campus, I dove headlong into my new life as a physics major. And I was fucking \*killing it\*.

One evening, I left my lab for a coffee break. I was entering the elevator when a lanky, brown haired Junior bounded up, calling for me to hold the door. Immediately upon him entering the elevator my nostrils were assaulted by the distinct stench of B.O. and unwashed hair. But this was the physics department, and personal hygiene seemed more difficult than quantum mechanics among its inhabitants so I thought little of it. We chatted during that elevator ride. He got off on the third floor to return to his research lab, and I got off on the fourth to return to mine.

Almost as soon as I sat down, I got a notification on Facebook. The stinky Junior had messaged me and was asking for a coffee date. Thrilled beyond measure that a real life boy had shown interest in me, I agreed.

Thus begins the Tale of Greaseface. 

We went on a coffee date that Saturday. I don't think he had showered since that elevator ride but who cares?! I was on \*a date\*! A real date with a living, breathing male human! I sat enthralled as he rambled on about how smart he was, about how every other member of the department was inferior to his intellectual prowess, and how he was probably going to win both a Nobel Prize and a Fields Medal by 30. He was sure to remind me that it was very cute that I thought I could hack it in physics and that I should be prepared to inevitably change my major.

Our following dates were no different. As each week passed he began to act more attached to me, though he refused to kiss me or acknowledge me any time we were on campus. He would rage if I even said ""hi"" to him on campus or if I commented on one of his Facebook posts. He told me that he would be ashamed if anyone knew we were together, that I was an embarrassment, and that he would never admit to even knowing me. Once, he told me that he would be ashamed to introduce me to his friends and family. 

The night of our first kiss went as follows. I planned a romantic double date with my best friends. We were all to dress up in our best clothes, eat Thai food, and just look fly and have fun. I spent \*hours\* getting ready. Greaseface hadn't texted me all day, but no worries. We'd confirmed our plans multiple times by then so I had no doubt that he would arrive at my best friends' house at 6.

Well, 6:00 came and went. 7:00 came and went. Finally, by 8 he texted me back and said that he had never agreed to this stupid date but he guessed he'd go anyway if I paid. Also he wasn't going to waste money on the bus to come to me so I had to come to him. So me and my best friends piled into the car and drove to campus to pick him up. We waited in the parking lot for another 45 minutes until he arrived, slouching, dragging his feet, and reeking, as always, to high heaven. We took a photo together on that date. I was beaming in my red dress and he was scowling. I posted the photo on Facebook. He raged. I deleted it.

Another week, I learned about summer internship programs called REU's. In those, a university pays you thousands of dollars to live on campus and do research for them for ten weeks. I wrote up my applications, got professors to agree to write letters of recommendation, and was all ready to submit when I made the mistake of telling Greaseface I planned on applying.

He scoffed, looked me up and down, and said, ""You really think they'd accept \*you\*? There are kids from MIT applying. What makes you think \*someone like you\* would get in?""

So I trashed my applications and gave up (let it be known that the day after our relationship ended I applied to ten REU sites and was accepted into at least two, a rare feat for a freshman). 

Greaseface also enjoyed reminding me how unattractive I was. Every time we were in public he pointed out every woman who was more attractive than me, following up that reminding with a jiggle of my thighs for good measure. 

But for my desperate, freshman self, I saw nothing wrong with any of these events I just related to you. The real, major issue was sex. I had made it clear early on I did not want to have sex until marriage. In those days I was much more religious and, frankly, was scared of sex. But I never wanted to make a man feel trapped, so I was always very clear about my limits early on. That way, we could end things amicably if we were incompatible in that area.

Well, just like with AnimeAssassin, Greaseface promised me up and down that he was just fine with waiting for sex until marriage. He told me I was worth it. He told me he didn't need sex anyway. I was thrilled! 

This lasted all of two weeks. He started pressuring me for sex. At least he did me the courtesy of not denying he had said he'd wait. He quite bluntly admitted that he only said that so I'd become more attached to him and it would be harder for me to say no. But I may have been a desperate girl but I was also a stubborn one. I refused to give in. I did not want to have sex with this man. 

Greaseface was also stubborn. When we went out in public and he pointed out the prettier women, he also reminded me that he could easily get with them and would if I kept saying no. When we kissed he'd force his hand ""down there"", and I'd have to force it away each time. If he ever ended up on top of me while making out, he'd ask for sex and, when I said no, go dead weight on top of me. He'd remain there, like a rotting fish, for an hour, his hard dick poking into me. Every attempt to speak to him or move him off me was ignored. 

Our time together lasted two months until he broke up with me for ""not putting out"". The night we broke up, I told him that I hope he finds someone he's compatible with and wished him luck. He shrugged and said, ""Yeah, I'm going to hook up with someone after I'm done here so let's hurry up."" 

Within a week, he tried getting back together with me. I ignored him. Since then, he hits me up every six months or so with some new insult. He also spent a year harassing every freshman girl and every new member of the physics organization I ran. The one and only time I spoke to him since the breakup was when I issued him his official notice that he was banned from the organization and further action would result in action from the department itself. 

Recently, I decided to change my career from nuclear physics to patent law. I had been accepted into but declined the offer from the best nuclear physics grad school in the country, and I made a post on social media about it. That was weeks ago.

Today, I got a message from Greaseface. He had always been vocal that I would never make it in physics and that anyone who left the field was stupid and a complete failure. So, I sent him a nice reply and promptly blocked him. My friends think my reply left him nicely roasted, \[so here it is for your amusement.\]([https://imgur.com/a/QrcePNz](https://imgur.com/a/QrcePNz))

Edit: to be clear, we aren't friends on social media. He had been defriended and blocked the night we broke up. I unblocked him when I was notified by members of my organization that he was harassing freshmen on Facebook so that I could see what he was saying. I forgot to reblock him after that, and I guess that's how he managed to hit me up. I don't know how he learned I was doing patent law, but I was well known in the department so I'm not surprised someone mentioned it to him.

Edit 2: I also forgot to add, I once told AnimeAssassin about Greaseface. He proceeded to look up Greaseface's Facebook profile, browse through it, and remark, ""He doesn't seem so bad. I could be friends with him"". BIRDS OF A FEATHER FLOCK TOGETHER I GUESS"

I am in my final year in college, majoring in electronics and communications engineering. The problem is that I haven't really realized how much of an actual problem colorblindness is until now. I had trouble finding internships because I failed every single medical exams because I failed the ishihara tests. Not a single one of the companies I interviewed for accempted me. How much harder getting hired would be when I do apply for a real job?

Engineers, I'd just like to ask, in what field are you in right now and how hard was it for you to find a job? What other fields can our skills be applied to without colorblindness getting in the way?

Programmers/developers has colorblindness been a problem in your job? Do you think without a CS degree, I can find a job similar to yours? I have been studying java and python, i don't know what to do with that skill yet though.

Thank you. Have a great day :)


Edit: Woah. Thank you so much everyone! You don't know how much better you made me feel!"
958md1,32,2018-08-07,Current roommate is moving out after only 3 months into our lease. Demands me or the next person who fills her room to pay for our shared furniture.,erwinsarm,AskNYC,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/958md1/current_roommate_is_moving_out_after_only_3/,"Long story short my current roommate is planning on moving to Chicago for whatever reason after staying in our 1 year lease apartment for only 3 months. 

The furniture in our room is our own and we paid for those by ourselves. However, the shared furniture such as the sofa, bathroom shelf, kitchen shelf etc we split 50/50 when we bought them since ya know, we originally agreed to live together for a year (surely at the end of our lease we would have decided to either throw some (cheap) ones away or keep a fair share of the furnitures, either way, something to decide once our lease ended.)

Does anyone else think it's unfair that she's demanding me to pay for the remaining price of the shared furniture? I personally find it a bit weird because 1. she also used those furnitures during the 3 months and 2. it was her sole decision to move out this early into our lease and out of any of my control

I'm currently tight on money as i literally just started a new paid job (was doing a barely paid internship during the last 3 months) and can't just give her the $100 she's demanding. She also said if i didn't want to pay for it then the next person moving in can, which also sounds weird to me????? I have never heard of someone who moved in and had the people who have already been living there demand money for furniture that was bought before they moved in.

My friends have told me she's being ridiculous and i just need more opinions so i can argue it out or something

TL;DR: current roommate moving out after 3 months during our 1 year lease. Wants me to pay for the half she paid on our shared furniture.

I know this might sound like I'm being petty and fighting over paying for furniture, but really it's more of how she's trying to get back every penny while breaking our lease and possibly leaving me with a random stranger moving in and having to deal with that on my own while she gets all of her money back and finds a new place.

----------

EDIT: her taking any of the furniture is out of the question. She's moving from NYC to Chicago, and if she's asking me to pay her she's obviously not going to pay to take any of them with her that far

EDIT 2: thanks everyone for your input, i really appreciate it since this is my first apartment in NYC after dorming throughout college.

my roommate is (was? lol) a friend and literally the last thing i want to do is to sue her or get the super/landlord involved which is probably gonna screw both of us. I told her straight up I'm not paying her half of the furniture and she eventually agreed. I told her if she was that desperate she can sell the couch (i barely use it anyway) but that was it. 

As for finding a new sublet to replace idk what's gonna happen yet but i told her if she let's some weirdo in I'm not gonna stand for it. Idk if you guys care that much but I'll update as this progresses."
958mo4,7,2018-08-07,My Ideal Spider-Man Movie,harriskeith29,marvelstudios,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/958mo4/my_ideal_spiderman_movie/,"**This is a rough draft for my hypothetical ideal Spider-Man film! Apologies for the length, feedback's welcome:** 👍

Tom Holland is high-schooler Peter Parker with elements of Maguire's origin (spider bite during a field trip to Oscorp, fighting Flash, wrestling for cash to buy a car to impress cheerleading captain Mary Jane, tragically losing Uncle Ben).

Similarly to **TASM**, he initially patrols for Ben's killer but is shocked upon tracking him down that this is the robber he let escape, after which the man falls to his death. Peter's pal + school celebrity Harry is fascinated with Spider-Man.

He accurately theorizes that this must be related to Oscorp's genetic engineering and insists on Peter's help to secretly research the company's different strains of super-spiders, searching for the species that (unbeknownst to him) bit Peter.

Harry's dad Norman meanwhile faces his board members outing him to sell Oscorp, pressured to test their military program's performance enhancers on himself. Enter: Green Goblin (mutant with the flight suit &amp; glider, not a mask).

After graduation, Peter works at the Daily Bugle to help May pay rent and befriends classmate + Oscorp intern Gwen Stacy. Eventually telling her his secret, he struggles with her dad NYPD Captain George who's pursuing Spider-Man.

Harry's neglected by his mentally deteriorating father whose dark side progressively worsens despite self-medication. Spider-Man meets Goblin at the Thanksgiving parade. George witnesses him save Gwen, rethinking his opinion of him.

Goblin resolves to find the wall crawler's identity by ANY means necessary, targeting Jonah Jameson to lure him out before tranquilizing him. He proposes a partnership with Spider-Man, taunting that he could kill his foe now if desired.

After a fight with Spidey in an apartment fire, Norman visits for Thanksgiving dinner but catches clues in Peter's room in spite of Parker's best efforts to hide his equipment. Norman frustrates Harry by leaving early, his ""illness"" acting up.

Poor young Osborn feels like a third wheel with Gwen, his spider research still fruitless while Peter claims he can't share his photos of Spider-Man. Norman notices his son's pain and promises to be a better father, to ""rectify certain inequities"".

Some time later, Goblin hospitalizes May. Gwen visits her with Peter and they talk before sharing a first kiss. Gwen is conflicted however and leaves. May then awakens, encouraging Peter to stop worrying about her and go after Gwen.

Goblin calls though, Peter realizing his cover's blown. Unable to reach and warn Gwen, he speeds to her ransacked home, finding her mom dead and George fatally wounded. When questioned at gunpoint why he's here, Peter reveals himself.

George reluctantly accepts that the city needs Spider-Man now but knows he'll make further enemies. He begs Peter to save his daughter but also promise to leave her out of his life after she's safe. Peter begrudgingly agrees as George dies.

Following news reports to the Queensboro Bridge, he's cornered by Goblin into choosing between saving Gwen or a Roosevelt Island Tram car of kids. Managing to save both, Spider-Man lands Gwen on the bridge before Goblin strikes.

Their battle spans across the bridge cables, alongside police helicopters, and into a condemned building where Peter's beaten down. Refusing to abandon the man she loves, Gwen steals a car and drives off before the cops can stop her.

Tom Holland is high-schooler Peter Parker with elements of Maguire's origin (spider bite during a field trip to Oscorp, fighting Flash, wrestling for cash to buy a car to impress cheerleading captain Mary Jane, tragically losing Uncle Ben).

Similarly to **TASM**, he initially patrols for Ben's killer but is shocked upon tracking him down that this is the robber he let escape, after which the man falls to his death. Peter's pal + school celebrity Harry is fascinated with Spider-Man.

He accurately theorizes that this must be related to Oscorp's genetic engineering and insists on Peter's help to secretly research the company's different strains of super-spiders, searching for the species that (unbeknownst to him) bit Peter.

Harry's dad Norman meanwhile faces his board members outing him to sell Oscorp, pressured to test their military program's performance enhancers on himself. Enter: Green Goblin (mutant with the flight suit &amp; glider, not a mask).

After graduation, Peter works at the Daily Bugle to help May pay rent and befriends classmate + Oscorp intern Gwen Stacy. Eventually telling her his secret, he struggles with her dad NYPD Captain George who's pursuing Spider-Man.

Harry's neglected by his mentally deteriorating father whose dark side progressively worsens despite self-medication. Spider-Man meets Goblin at the Thanksgiving parade. George witnesses him save Gwen, rethinking his opinion of him.

Goblin resolves to find the wall crawler's identity by ANY means necessary, targeting Jonah Jameson to lure him out before tranquilizing him. He proposes a partnership with Spider-Man, taunting that he could kill his foe now if desired.

After a fight with Spidey in an apartment fire, Norman visits for Thanksgiving dinner but catches clues in Peter's room in spite of Parker's best efforts to hide his equipment. Norman frustrates Harry by leaving early, his ""illness"" acting up.

Poor young Osborn feels like a third wheel with Gwen, his spider research still fruitless while Peter claims he can't share his photos of Spider-Man. Norman notices his son's pain and promises to be a better father, to ""rectify certain inequities"".

Some time later, Goblin hospitalizes May. Gwen visits her with Peter and they talk before sharing a first kiss. Gwen is conflicted however and leaves. May then awakens, encouraging Peter to stop worrying about her and go after Gwen.

Goblin calls though, Peter realizing his cover's blown. Unable to reach and warn Gwen, he speeds to her ransacked home, finding her mom dead and George fatally wounded. When questioned at gunpoint why he's here, Peter reveals himself.

George reluctantly accepts that the city needs Spider-Man now but knows he'll make further enemies. He begs Peter to save his daughter but also promise to leave her out of his life after she's safe. Peter begrudgingly agrees as George dies.

Following news reports to the Queensboro Bridge, he's cornered by Goblin into choosing between saving Gwen or a Roosevelt Island Tram car of kids. Managing to save both, Spider-Man lands Gwen on the bridge before Goblin strikes.

Their battle spans across the bridge cables, alongside police helicopters, and into a condemned building where Peter's beaten down. Refusing to abandon the man she loves, Gwen steals a car and drives off before the cops can stop her.

As Goblin threatens to give Gwen a painful end, the bloodied Peter snaps and pummels Goblin to the point of Norman pleading for mercy. He uses this opening to try killing Spider-Man with his glider but stabs himself when Peter dodges.

The dying Norman asks him not to tell Harry before blacking out. Gwen then shows up behind Peter, having found the building. He kisses and professes his love to her but Goblin takes one last dying breath to say ""Godspeed, Spider-Man"".

9599a5,4,2018-08-07,My girlfriend(21/F) of 3 years and I(23/M) just finished our first deployment and says she doesn't see a way our relationship can continue. What can I do?,bananaboi4,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9599a5/my_girlfriend21f_of_3_years_and_i23m_just/,"We have been together for a little over 3 years now. We meet in college, but we attended different colleges due to similar clubs and mutual friends. It was about 2 hr drive away from each other. It was considered long distance for some people as we could not reasonably see each other each day but have to schedule weekends to see each other. Everything worked out. A year ago, I decided I wanted to join the navy and we had a long talk about what our relationship would be like and if she wanted to stay. We decided that we should try to make it work and a few weeks after our 2nd anniversary, I left for boot camp. The 2 month period plus learning that my orders are across the country, put a real strain on our relationship. I came home to be with her for 2 weeks and everything seemed to be fine. We talked about our future and would try to make it work. At this point she said that she doesn't want a relationship like ours because of the distance and uncertainty of me being in the military but is scared to breakup. We agreed to postpone our discussion until after my deployment and see if our feelings change. I headed across country and started my first deployment while she was finishing up school and started a summer internship. She has one more year of school left. We were both quite busy and couldn't talk or write as much as we wished to, but it still seemed to be fine. After deployment, i came back home to visit her and halfway through the week, she said that she wants to break up.

Her are her concerns that she learned after being apart for a year and minimal contact for 5 months:

* Does not want to move to where she knows no one.

* Does not want to be dependent on me financially. aka moving and being just a housewife.

* Does not want get married because she doesn't feel ready.

* Really misses physical contact and affection

* Not being able to do couple things like holidays, dates, couples projects, etc

Some pros

* Can't see herself with anyone else

* Says nothing wrong with me, just the situation  

* Happy throughout relationship and really enjoys our time together

There is no thoughts of cheating going on or other people being involved to make it simple. She rather start the process of moving on than being sad until we see each other every few months. We are both mature enough that agreed to spend the rest of my week together and then call it quits after. I find it really hard to let her go because she is so perfect for me and that if I didn't leave, she said there would be not reason not to spend the rest of our lives together. How can either convince her to stay with me(move in with me after college) or how can I accept the outcome and move on?"

And if she is, how can I find ways to endure her actions before moving out?",nmojns,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/959cn9/is_my_mom_an_nmom_and_if_she_is_how_can_i_find/,"I'm 20yo female, and I live with both my parents +I'm an only child. I feel like my parents genuinely care about me (esp my dad) but I question my mom's actions a lot and makes me feel like she's an nmom sometimes, but the next moment she's very understanding (???) so I have difficulty trying to decipher her.

I ask for my parents permission a lot because I live under their roof and respect their decision on things... Sometimes. It's gotten to the point that if I ask them if I could do certain things, they say no, unless it's school or work related. So honestly? I lie about 90% of the time. I asked my mom if I could go to Florida with my boyfriend and his family for a week, and she said ""No, because he doesn't love you enough to visit me."" To be fair, I don't want him to because she's going to torture him like she tortures me. With guilt. All the time.

I'm in the midst of college, so I endure a lot of her behavior and actions because I'm afraid my parents aren't going to help me with the out of pocket tuition. I can't afford that plus living expenses if I lived alone. I could move with my boyfriend, but I can't afford tuition even if he helped with living expenses. There's just no way.

If I go out with my mom, I need approval of what I can wear out (in her eyes, it's for ""in case you look fat""). She's legit embarrassed to be seen with me. She doesn't want me to cut my hair because she just doesn't want me to and because she says I'm fat. She says I can't wear dresses size 2 because I'm fat-- even though I fit them. She got upset because yes, I did get approval of a tattoo from her, but she's mad because she didn't get to choose what it was. She comes into my room barging in without knocking, and doesn't really care for my privacy. She's also always demanding things from me and when I say I can't because of school, she's very petty. 

But the thing is, she's occasionally nice. She leaves some food for me at night when I come home from a really late shift (like in the AM). She told me she would help support me if my internship is unpaid and I need to relocate. She pays for my gas (my dad pays for insurance and car) but that's from an agreement we made. If I stay at home for college, all of that + food and everything is paid for. Once I move out, I will be cut off completely financially. 

I need help to motivate myself to keep going. How do I avoid her constant negative behavior? It's taking a toll on me emotionally. I'm not locked in a prison, but the idea of not being able to make my own decisions independently makes me feel really restricted. I understand I'm an only child, but this feels really far from that. Me wanting to travel to Japan for the summer is unrealistic for me because my mom says I can't travel until I graduate because it's only school school school.

But I feel heavily guilty if I don't follow the rules. Like I feel like it's my job because I'm the only kid they ever had, but I feel really stressed out because I take care of them and my grandmother, as well as occasionally my uncle since he can't depend on his own untrustworthy daughters. 

TLDR; is my mom an nmom? What can I do to keep myself going even though I'm falling into depression from living with her? I'm financially unstable without her help and I'm in University."
959iyn,0,2018-08-07,Friend 1 [M 21] blocked me on everything but Facebook. Plan to visit his place to talk in person. How should I approach this situation? [ LONG ],EclipseLV13,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/959iyn/friend_1_m_21_blocked_me_on_everything_but/,"Backstory:  
We were great high school friends. Throughout most of the year me, along with another good friend [M 20] who I will call Friend2, always hung out together and had the best times together. 

After me and Friend2 moved to college, things changed a lot. We each got into serious relationships whereas Friend1 did not and did not attend college. This created a divide in our friendship. The 3 of us stopped communicating throughout the year. 

During summer 2016, Friend1 was excited that we returned back to visit. However, it seemed as if he always wanted to hang out and did not take our serious relationships into consideration. As a result, mine and friend2's girlfriend thought negatively of Friend1. For example there were discussions about our girlfriends prying us away from Friend1 and so the gfs were mad about this. Regardless we continued to hang out regularly but it never seemed to satisfy Friend1. Friend1 was fed up at the fact that we never paid enough attention to him or committed enough time to the friendship in his eyes. Friend1 was fed up with this at the end of summer. Friend2 and I headed back to college, however, it worsened things since our communication dropped. At this point in time Friend2 began to fade away as well and dropped communication with me.

Fast forward to Summer 2017. I reached out to Friend1 on all platforms (social media &amp; video game chats). Eventually I broke through and spoke with Friend1 for a week. He explained how it was difficult to move on from me and Friend2. He was happy that I was still together with my gf which gave me hope that our friendship could be revived. We planned to meet up within a week when I returned from college, and as soon as I returned he ghosted and Friend1 never responded. This time he blocked me on almost everything apart from Facebook. During this summer I had an internship so I didn't have the time to visit him in person and headed back to college after it ended.

Fast forward to the present day. 

I recently reached out to Friend2 and we began talking weekly. In 2 weeks I will visit home and we both plan to visit Friend1 to confront him about where our friendships stand. Friend1 does not know we will show up. 

I would like to revive our friendship since we were on the brink of it 1 year ago. I believe Friend1 is a true friend. He feels betrayed that we didn't think of him or cared about him. I feel bad that I was not there for him when he might have needed me or that I wasn't able to make him happy when we hung out 2 summers ago. At this point in time my gf understands how important friendships are to me and felt bad that I lost Friend1. 

I wanted to ask how should I open up about this situation to him when we talk in person? 
I intend to inform him that I believe this is a friendship worth fighting for no matter what since after all this time, I never made true friends at college. 
Is there anything I should avoid saying? 
Should I not speak about our girlfriends and let him bring up the topic? 
Should I talk more about how we had fun times in the past?
Should I try to message him on Facebook at the risk of him blocking me?
Left one voice mail already, should I leave more voicemails?
Should I try to call house number to try and reach him or should I wait until we visit him?

I don't want to mess this up because I feel as if any slight error could ruin my chance at getting Friend1 back in my life. And this might be the only time I visit him in person.

Tl;dr
Friend2 and I got into serious relationships. Friend1's jealousy led to tension between the 3 of us. Friend1 did not attend college while Friend2 and I did. Over the past 2 years we stopped talking. Friend1 blocked blocked us both. He supposedly feels betrayed. My gf is more open to my friendship with Friend1 now. Recently, I spoke with Friend2. We plan to visit him in person in 2 weeks. What should I say to rekindle our friendship?



I will be actively responding this week while I can, and will give an update after I see him hopefully. Thanks for all the advice in advance."
959z7m,40,2018-08-07,Coils Chapter 3: Hazardous Studies,unexpectedlykinky,Tentai,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tentai/comments/959z7m/coils_chapter_3_hazardous_studies/,"(Sorry for not uploading! I lost my motivation between the couch cushions and found it thanks to all of your support!)

Melissa Rodgers watched with the rest of her staff as the squirming, obscene outline of a D-class slid down one of SCP-5127's many tentacles, his struggling body soon disappearing into the tangle of appendages that was the anomalous creature. It's been several months since the arrival of SCP-5127, and since then a surprisingly small amount of data has been recovered, much to her frustration and the site director's growing impatience. 

Attempts to see the internal structure of 5127 has proven futile. Human-sized dolls with cameras were immediately destroyed. D-class outfitted with external cameras and, in one instance an artificial camera eye surgically replacing the subject's organic eye, have only resulted in the cameras destroyed by the mucus, regardless of if they were waterproof.

Tests have shown that, while SCP-5127 will consume other animals to fulfill its diet, humans have shown to be the most receptive to 'hugs's drug-laced excretions. The mucus-like slime has proven to be a powerful aphrodisiac to human subjects but a mild toxin to all other exposed animals, causing them to expire before the ingestion process can be completed.

SCP-5127 has also shown signs of rapid growth, needing a newer, larger tank on two separate occasions over the past 6 months, costing Site-66 two engineers in a breach during the process, and may need another in the coming month. The growth rate increases as SCP-5127 is fed D-class over time, however starving it of human subjects has caused SCP-5127 to enter what is dubbed a 'starve state', in which SCP-5127 will enter a frenzy in an attempt to find more prey. This has caused the damaging of one reinforced containment tank and the loss of three security personnel. Methods to slow or halt SCP-5127's growth without endangering the staff have proven inconclusive. However, SCP-5127's regular feedings will not be halted, as per the orders of Dr. Rodgers.

These feedings have given the staff no new points of research, only proving that SCP-5127 will accept both male and female prey of adult maturity and will sexually assault both before ingestion. These feedings were not done for science. They were done for Dr. Rodgers. 

When Dr. Rodgers witnessed D-0372 be thoroughly cocooned in rubbery, firm tentacles, she didn't pay attention to the way SCP-5127 secreted mucus at a faster rate than without prey, or how it ingested its prey. No, she paid attention to how 5127 pressed its many firm, slimy tentacles against D-0372's holes. The wet sounds punctuated by 0372's throaty, muffled moans of pleasure were ingrained in Dr. Rodgers' mind as she watched 0372 be pulled out of sight into 5127's grasp. She watched the sucker marks form on 0372's hips and thighs as the tendrils readjusted to better hold her captive. But most of all, she locked eyes with 0372's lust-filled gaze. Rodgers didn't see horror, fear, or pain. She saw unbridled bliss before the D-class was taken out of sight.

When she closed her eyes in the subsequent weeks, all she could see was that face. In silence, she'd hear the groans, the cries of ecstasy, the sounds of wet, slimy movement off in the distance. Every time she thought about it, a spark began to light deep inside her belly, a warmth that grew in her nethers. Melissa hadn't had contact with someone so intimately in years, and under her cold and professional demeanor, she knew she wanted that contact with someone. 

The following week when another D-class was sent to 5127 for testing, a young man who was struggling to accept his fate as a meal for this beast, her attention was once again drawn from the scientific study, and instead to the carnal acts forced upon the man. Her eyes followed the two tentacles cocooning his cock, stroking him as his body rocked and his mouth emitted grunts of delight. She watched his virgin holes stretched by the instinctual beast, his chest heaving as he gagged on the fat, slimy, musky appendage and his stomach bulged from the animalistic pumping he was subjected to. 

Watching the D-class's head disappear into a tube-like tendril, the saliva dripping down his body as his torso was engulfed and his cock sprayed cum all over the glass, it made Dr. Rodgers realize something. She didn't want contact with some*one*. She wanted contact with some*thing*. This *thing* that could pleasure her and make up all those years spent celibate due to her work. It was a thought that she knew was insane, absolutely unthinkable! And yet, it excited her more than even she would admit to herself. The idea that she could leave all this work and stress and simply live in pleasure without consequence.

She'd dream of being entangled in those strong, rubbery tendrils, and the feeling of those suckers grabbing her skin and leaving marks. The thought made her tremble, and every night she'd feel her hand wander as her mind found itself thinking about the last D-class fed to the beast. It made her want to see more. She scheduled feedings more often, some set for far after the staff had gone, and she could have her privacy to watch her little show. Even now as she watched the young woman's bulging body disappear into the tentacle pile, surrounded by her coworkers, she could feel her wetness dripping down her thighs and her nipples hardening against her bra to the point that even the slightest movement would make her hand quiver and her breath hitch. But it wasn't enough.

She found it difficult to imagine herself in those slimy situations with those orange jumpsuits the D-class were given. The footage of 5127's recovery helped for a time, but soon she found even that lacking. She wanted to see something closer to home, something to heighten her fantasies. She grimly wished for another breach. She knew nobody would get hurt, and the 'victims' would *love* it. As fate would have it, she would have her wish, when one of the safety hatches leading into 5127's tank became stuck.

It happened during one of the head researcher's ""private sessions"", much to her dismay. Dr. Rodgers was first struck with professional worry, but as her gaze fell upon the faulty equipment, her worry was replaced with lustful excitement. This was an accident waiting to happen, and as it just so happened, Dr. Rodgers had two fresh researchers that would make a mistake as simple as going to fix the hatch themselves without supervision, right? It was all an *accident.*

She pulled out her radio, switching to their frequencies specifically as to not gain any unwanted attention. ""Dr. Mathison, Dr. Hawkins, can you both come to SCP-5127's cell? The hatch got stuck again."" Within minutes, she was greeted with the tall, slender young man and his shorter, pear-shaped co-worker both walking across the catwalk towards the stuck hatch. Normally, this was no big deal, and with all the mucus 5127 produces, the hatch was getting stuck almost daily. However, *normally* there was a control room full of staff that could temporarily stun 5127 with an electric shock, should the second hatch be opened by an overeager SCP. But there wasn't a control room full of staff. There was only Dr. Rodgers, and her heartrate quickened as the two junior researchers got closer.

The two glorified interns stopped at the stuck hatch, staring down through the glass tank into the nest of tentacles that were already latching their palm-sized suction cups onto the glass and popping off in an instinctual hunger. The two looked down at the hatch, opening it fully to get it un-stuck, and would look up just in time to see more tentacles reaching for the secondary safety hatch. There was the sound of a mechanism shifting, Dr. Hawkins screamed at the top of her lungs, and Dr. Rodgers shifted in her seat in excitement at the sound of moving hatches. 

Her excited smile fell, however, when the two doctors got the hatch closed just as 5127 got the safety hatch open. Dr. Mathison was already reaching for his radio to report the incident while Hawkins was beginning to back away from the hatch after securing it tightly. Rodgers watched in shock as more tentacles tried to open the hatch, to no avail, trying to reach their meal. It was so close. *Melissa* was so close. Her mind was so fogged in her own sexual frustration, that her one most powerful fantasy was about to play out in front of her only to be denied, that her professional facade collapsed. She felt her hand rest on a button before she could realize what she'd done, and the mechanical whir of the primary hatch opening filled the air. 

Neither of them had a chance to react as the fat, slimy tentacles poured out. Hawkins was caught first, her head lost under coils of rusty-red meat as her face was coiled up and her hearing was filled with the sound of wet, ravenous sucking. Her hair was matted to the tendril's flesh as she was tugged head-first towards the opening to the containment cell. Her screams were so weak and muffled. Her struggles to pry the tentacle off were futile as her skin and nails slid off of 5127's thick hide. The sight of her being drawn head-first into a sexual hell made Dr. Rodgers find the urge to caress herself through her clothes as she watched. 

Mathison let out a panicked gasp and tried to run, but found his ankles securely bound by two more warm, strong pseudopods. He fell flat on his stomach, knocking the wind out of himself, and giving 5127 just enough time for it to reach out with more hungry tendrils and slip them under the leg openings. Mathison squirmed breathlessly as the outlines of the tentacles stretched his trousers and reached his inner thighs. The young man struggled and grabbed at the invading appendages, but his hands only found the slime seeping through the cloth. 

Hawkins was dragged through the hatch and into the pile of tentacles, Rodgers sliding a hand down into her pants and massaging he wetness as she saw tentacles with sucker-shaped tips slip under Hawkins's collar and into her shirt. She tensed and thrashed as her bra was pushed aside by the tentacles and her small, perky breasts were met with hungry, swarming arms. She let out a mix between a moan and a cry through the tentacles grabbing her face as her shirt bulged and stretched with every sucking motion of the tendrils latched onto her tits. Her work pants weren't sacrificed either as they began to rip as more tentacles began to do to her what was already happening to Mathison.

He watched as his pants began to tear from the throbbing tentacles grabbing his legs. he felt the wash of warmth over his boxers before the smooth appendages latched onto his cock and began to stroke him. He cringed as he felt another tentacle slip over his ass, planting a sucker on his tight pucker to help him get hard from this new, strange stimulation. Dr. Rodgers couldn't help but let out a choked moan as she watched a tendril slip into Mathison's pants and over his cock, swallowing his hardness in a sloppy, slimy tentacle-blowjob. The head researcher could hear the wet sucking among the groans, and it drove her wild. 

Hawkins felt the tentacles around her head readjust, releasing her mouth and giving her a moment's scream before a wet tentacle gagged her. She could taste the salty slime as it dripped down her throat, the appendage pistoning into her mouth and making her head bob with every thrust. As her pants were pulled and stretched, her body grew hotter and hotter from the strange drool the creature was feeding her. Her moans were getting louder, her struggles weakening, and the tendrils became more feverish. She could feel them tear her panties, sliding up and down her slit and latching suckers onto her clit while her ass was spread and squeezed. 

Mathison felt the tentacles slip out from the waist of his pants and under his shirt, slowly dragging him towards the hatch. as he writhed in the creature's grip. His hands grabbed at tentacles without much success as they crawled over his chest and back, drenching him in viscous slime. He was hard as he's ever been now, the constant sucking and milking drawing him closer and closer to orgasm as he felt the tip of one thick tendril prod his ass.

Hawkins began to suck on the monster meat in her mouth, her tongue swirling over its slimy, salty skin. Her bobbing head moved willingly and her hips gyrated to the grinding. Her body was at its mercy, and she began to love it. She screamed in pure pleasure as her pussy was stretched wide, the tendrils teasing her finally slipping into her sopping wet hole. She moaned with every thrust, her belly bulging from the pounding her body was taking. She felt more tentacles reach around her, squeezing her stomach, restraining her arms, and one finally thrusting deep into her ass. She began to tense as more tentacles piled onto her, tasting every inch of her skin, and as her orgasm subsided, she disappeared as the tentacles within the chamber claimed her.

Mathison was much less lucky, his arms and head now under thick coils of 5127. He felt his head get tilted back as two tendrils slithered into his mouth. They stretched his jaw wide, making him gag, and making his eyes roll back when his throat stretched from their immediate savage pounding of his mouth. His cock throbbed in the wet, tight hole his cock was stuffed in. He twitched and shuddered as his legs and waist were quickly dragged into the hatch, his uniform inflated by tentacles swarming his body underneath his clothes. As his head passed the threshold, his eyes bulged from his head as his ass was violated, the mix of pain and pleasure shooting through him like lightning as his body was dragged into the nest of tentacles. 

Rodgers had both hands in her pants now, rocking her hips back and forth as her mouth hung open. The noises she was making were deep and primal, so much pent up frustration finally being released as she watched two of her staff be grabbed, fucked and milked, and finally consumed as she watched their two squirming forms travel down one long,undulating tendril. She let out one last cry, a powerful orgasm rocking her body and soaking both her pants and panties, as she watched the shapes of Hawkins and Mathison disappear into the beast. She collapsed in her seat, totally spent, and dripping in sweat. The control room smelled of her sex, and she even began to pass out. At least, she was, until she saw the tendrils reaching from the still-open hatch to the door leading to the facility. 

She hit the emergency switch to drop the containment tank into the acid below, but 5127 had already gotten its suckers on the door. It drew itself up towards the door, forced the door open with its strength, and disappeared into the facility. She sat there, frozen in fear and disbelief, as her senses returned to her. 

It wasn't long before she could hear the soft, undeniable squishing beyond the observatory door."

95b21h,18,2018-08-07,An Overview of Arizona Primary Races - Part 4: Legislative Races 11-20,hunter15991,BlueMidterm2018,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlueMidterm2018/comments/95b21h/an_overview_of_arizona_primary_races_part_4/,"Welcome to my omnibus compendium of Arizona’s upcoming primary races (set to take place August 28th – early voting ballots should have been mailed out August 1st). Arizona’s a really interesting state (I may be a hair biased), since it not only is home to two to four swing House seats and a high-profile Senate race, but also a vulnerable governor (thanks to the teacher walkout earlier this year) and tenuous majorities in both state houses that could – theoretically – deliver a Dem trifecta this fall. Other statewide candidates have also been on the attack, and few Republicans are safe in this climate. If Dr. Tipirneni’s massive swing in April can be replicated across the state, the Dems will pull off a coup of stupidly high proportions.

If you’re interested about which district you live in, check https://azredistricting.org/districtlocator/. If you want to get involved with your local Democratic party, find your legislative district on the previous link (NOT CD), and then search for your LD’s name at [this link]( https://web.archive.org/web/20180703030045/http://www.azdem.org/LocalLeaders). Feel free to attend meetings, they’re a great way to get involved with candidates and like-minded individuals. If you wish to donate to a “clean elections” candidate (mentioned in the post as “running clean”), you will have to live in that candidate’s legislative district to do so. Statewide “clean” candidates can accept from anyone, although al such candidates probably have hit their goals for the cycle. 

If you are a registered Independent and do not want to vote at the polls, you will need to request and early ballot using the website of your county’s recorder. Example links for [Maricopa](https://recorder.maricopa.gov/earlyvotingballot/earlyvotingballotrequest.aspx), [Pima](https://www.recorder.pima.gov/BallotByMailRequest), and [Pinal](http://www.pinalcountyaz.gov/Recorder/Pages/RequestEarlyBallot.aspx). Others available if needed.

Race ratings for listed primaries will be listed as Solid/Likely/Leans/Tossup and are not indicative of my own preference for that seat. I’ll denote my personal primary preferences at the end of this series.

Some candidates have filed as write-in candidates for their primary. I’m unsure about the rules behind this, and if a win means they automatically appear on the ballot in November – currently in process of verifying. For example, in 2016 Gary Swing and Merissa Hamilton both won their respective Senate primaries (Green/Libertarian) as write-ins, but only Swing was on the ballot in the fall.

If you have any questions about voting in the primary, which races are the most contested, and how to get involved with other Democrats in Arizona, feel free to PM me.

#***State Legislative Races*** 

So as mentioned in the intro post, this’ll cover not only the federal and statewide candidates but also the state legislative races. Arizona has 30 districts, each with 1 Senator and 2 Representatives. Republicans hold meh majorities in both chambers (17-13 in the Senate, and 35-25 in the House), but Dems think this is the year for a potential flip of chambers. Due to time constraints I’ll try to focus on races with primaries, and write a primer about important general election races later – but hopefully I can get all of them done. Our party went balls to the wall and recruited 114 Democratic candidates to run this cycle, meaning that there’s a candidate running in every race across Arizona, in even the reddest of red districts. It also means there’s a ***lot*** of blurbs to write.

One additional point to make – the vast majority of people using the Arizona Clean Elections funding source are running for the state legislature. Their COH statistics will be denoted as ($XXX COH, Clean). This - for the most part – means that the only  additional money they can expect in the race will come after/if they win their respective primaries, roughly to the tune of $20K-$25K or so.

 So without further ado, the districts!

_____________________________________________________________________________________

***District 11***

For our first district in the second installment of the legislative series, we head over to Northern Tucson/Casa Grande, a district that – like LD8 before it – is surprisingly only Leans Red despite its demographics and geographical location. The Republican Senate incumbent is noted theocratic asshole ***Steve Smith***, who as mentioned earlier is trying to make the hop over into Congress. His Republican heir apparent is State Representative ***Vince Leach*** ($118.5K COH). The other incumbent Republican Representative, ***Mark Finchem*** ($44.4K COH) is running for re-election in the House, with Constable ***Bret Roberts*** ($16.7K COH, Clean) and retired carpenter ***Howie Jones*** ($700 COH) running for the second open spot. Roberts has been endorsed by Finchem and Leach and seems set to take the second nomination. His choice of running clean is odd, especially as a party-approved candidate.

Roberts may make it through to the general, but he’ll most likely run into rural liberal powerhouse ***[Hollace Lyon](https://www.lyonforaz.com/meet-hollace)*** ($93K COH). Unlike in LD8, the House candidate (Lyon) seems set to drag the Democratic slate, kicking and screaming, into relevancy. Wife of the president of the Arizona School Boards Association (Linda Lyon) and retired USAF Colonel, Lyon brings a great combination of education bona fides, fundraising/campaigning chops (She has outraised everyone in the district - Leach’s COH advantage is only because of his past warchest), and rural appeal (she channels Amy McGrath’s rhetoric to great success. Lyon would be a great single-shot candidate for the candidate.

Except she’s not running alone. Perennial candidate ***Barry McCain*** (no link because his website’s dead and he’s a bit of a nut, also $4 COH) managed to qualify for the ballot again this year by some miracle. Local and state party leaders, wary of ceding a ballot slot to nigh-invisible candidate, recruited local teacher and education advocate ***[Marcela Quiroz](https://www.facebook.com/MarcelaQuirozForLD11/)*** ($630 COH, Clean – needs $5’s). While Quiroz has had some trouble getting her campaign ff the ground, she is by far a better #2 than McCain. In the Senate, rancher ***[Ralph Atchue](http://atchue4azsenate.com/)*** ($15.4K, Clean) is taking a second crack at the seat. Atchue didn’t generate many waves last time, and this time – if he does win – it will be on the backs of Lyon and Quiroz. The presence of Green Party write-in ***Mohammad Arif*** won’t help.

As mentioned before, the general rests squarely on the shoulders of Hollace Lyon, and partially on Quiroz’s as well. Both House and Senate candidates have a defined rural appeal, but only Lyon seems capable of actually translating that into results. If the statewide wave is large enough, she’ll drag Quiroz and Atchue in on her coattails. 

***hunter15991 Rating: Dem Senate uncontested. Solid Lyon, Likely Quiroz. GOP Senate uncontested, Solid Finchem, Likely Roberts. Leans GOP Senate, Tossup House Roberts/Lyon, Leans GOP Finchem/Quiroz.***

_________________________________________________________________________________

***District 12***

Popping back up north somewhat, we take a look at LD12 – located in the heart of CD5. Centered in Gilbert and Southeast Mesa, 12 is so stupidly red, only LD1 and LD5 are worse. On the Republican side, incumbent Representative ***Travis Grantham*** ($26K COH) is being joined by incumbent Senator ***Warren Petersen*** ($49K COH) in their quest for House nominations, and are being primaried from the right by Mr “Ban All Public Schools” ***Nick Myers*** ($600 COH), and from the center by adjunct professor ***Blake Sacha*** ($36.5K COH). In the Senate, charter school owner and incumbent State Rep. ***Eddie Farnsworth*** ($26.2K COH) is running, being challenged from the nominal center by businessman ***Jimmy Lindblom*** ($25K COH). Lindblom still holds most of Farnsworth’s conservative views, but is attacking Farnsworth regarding how corrupt of a legislator he is, profiting off of charter school requirements he passes.

On the Democratic side, ***[Elizabeth Brown](https://brownforazld12.nationbuilder.com/)*** ($15.5K) is rehashing a 2016 Senate run, and will be joined by two House nominees – currently that looks like teacher ***[Joe Bisaccia](https://bisaccia4az.com/)*** ($12K COH, Clean) and lawyer ***[Lynsey Robinson](http://www.lynseyrobinson4az.com/bio/)*** ($16.88K COH, Clean). Robinson is actually running on a slate with 2014 House nominee ***[DJ Rothans](https://rothansforhouse.org/)*** ($150 COH, Clean), but his campaign has not gotten as much traction as hers.

Given the breakdown of this district it is highly unlikely a Dem. pulls it off either in the House or Senate, and with the amount of district infighting that’s ongoing (per rumors, Brown and Bisaccia hate each other’s guts and are causing a lot of chaos because of that) that chance goes from slim to none. The best bet in this scenario is for Sacha and Lindblom to pull off the upset in primaries. While they’re at best mediocre friends of public education (Sacha) and at worse a slightly cleaner version of the incumbent (Lindblom), they’re a step up from the clusterfuck currently ongoing in the district.

***hunter15991 Rating: Dem Senate uncontested. Likely Bisaccia, Likely Robinson. Leans Farnsworth, Likely Petersen, Leans Finchem. All Solid GOP general.***


______________________________________________________________________________

***District 13***

District 13 could be a bit of a Roy Moore-ish scenario for Democrats, at least in the Senate. 

So I’ll get the House out of the way first. Reps ***Darin Mitchell*** ($7.3K COH) and ***Tim Dunn*** ($76K COH)- both Republicans – are the current Representatives for the district. Mitchell has built a long-term brand in the district, while Dunn was appointed n February 2018 following…well we’ll get to that in a second. They are being challenged from the right by absolute wackadoodle ***Trey Terry*** ($9K COH), and from the center(ish) by Goodyear ViceMayor ***Joanne Osborne*** ($10.5K COH). Mitchell and Dunn seem set to make it out of their primaries by virtue of their incumbency (and Dunn’s surprisingly large warchest), although if Osborne can convince enough moderate Republicans to vote for her (she *seems* to be against some anti-publicEd measures here in AZ) she stands a fraction of a chance. Mitchell and Dunn will face Democrat ***[Thomas Tzitzura](https://www.tzitzuraforaz.com/)*** ($1.1K COH, Clean), a veteran, former teacher, and adorable old guy. He’s set to lose by 30.

But we’re interested in the Senate.

Currently, the Senate seat is held by farmer ***Sine Kerr*** ($40.6K COH), an unimposing backbencher appointed to the seat in February after Steve Motnenegro resigned his seat when he tried – and failed -to win the GOP nomination for CD8. She’s being challenged in the primary by businessman ***Brent Backus*** ($4K COH), and in the general by retired Air Force veteran ***[Michelle Harris](https://www.harrisforarizona.com)*** (4.8K COH, Clean). If Kerr wins the primary, her general election should be relatively easy – the last Democrat to run for Senate here didn’t crack 35%. 

But there’s another Republican running.

On February 1st, 2018, the Arizona State House voted to expel sexual assault perpetrator ***Don Shooter*** ($18K COH), a longtime Senator and at that time Representative from LD13. ***[A report over 80 pages long detailing his deeds was filed with the House, and they had no choice but to kick him to the curb.](https://images.phoenixnewtimes.com/media/pdf/rep_shooterrep_ugenti-rita.pdf)*** His career seemed dead.

Ever the enigma, Shooter didn’t stop collecting signatures for the Senate run he was planning on this year (pending Montenegro’s resignation), and on the last day to file for the State Senate he submitted signatures to run again in LD13. This upended Kerr’s easy walk to re-election – while Shooter’s statewide brand was kneecapped, the voters in LD13 by and large seemed unphased by his wrongdoings at the state legislature. And with a stronger name-rec in the area and a fundraising system that doesn’t seem to be phased by his misdeeds, Shooter seems set to snatch primary victory from the jaws of defeat. With the anti-sexual abuser vote set to be split by Backus, Arizona’s Roy Moore (I don’t use that lightly, he preyed on college and high school interns as well) could make it to the general.

For all of Harris’s pros, she falters where Lyon succeeds as a candidate – both in funds, branding, and campaign intensity. If Kerr or even Backus win the Senate nomination, Harris is toast. But if Shooter makes it through somehow, the retired Master Sergeant stands a chance at turning this district blue. It will hinge on the morals of LD13 independents, and AZGOP rescinding support for Shooter if he sneaks through the primaries. 

Will the stars align for Harris? Will Shooter’s attempt to reclaim his former glory turn this district blue?

Probably not.

But “probably” isn’t good enough in 2018.

***hunter15991 Rating: Dem primaries uncontested. Leans Shooter, Likely Mitchell/Kerr. Safe GOP House general. Leans GOP Senate.***
 
_________________________________________________________________________________

***District 14***

Like past districts, LD14 is more of a question as to who wins the GOP primary than who wins the general. The Dems are fielding businessman ***[Bob Karp](http://bobkarpforarizona.com/why-im-running/)*** ($1K COH, Clean) and businesswoman ***[Shelley Renee-Leon](https://www.facebook.com/AZRepDistrict14/)*** ($1.5K COH, Clean) for the House, while there’s a competitive primary between 2016 nominee ***[Jaime Alvarez](http://www.alvarezforsenate.com/)*** ($1.2K COH, Clean), and teacher ***[Mendy Gomez](https://twitter.com/mendygomezforaz?lang=en)*** ($1.4K COH, Clean). Alvarez should make it through the primary due to his name rec from 2016, but with teachers gaining prominence in post-strike Arizona, Gomez could take it from him. 

A safe GOP district, the main question is how races on the right pan out. The House is rather tame, incumbent Rep. ***Becky Nutt*** ($19.3K COH) and outgoing Senator ***Gail Griffin*** ($31.4K COH) are uncontested for the nomination there. For Senate, there is a three-way battle between former House speaker ***David Gowan*** ($54K COH), incumbent State Rep. ***Drew John*** ($38K),   and Army vet/businesswoman ***Lori Kilpatrick*** ($15.7K COH, Clean).  Gowan, a candidate for CD1 back in 2016, has come to reclaim his old LD14 fiefdom, but Drew John seems hesitant to give it up without a fight. If Rep. John can hold steady, he’ll deprive the GOP of a massively-experienced ex-legislator and replace him with a freshman, milquetoast backbencher in John. Any nominee seems set to win the general, but if Gowan strikes out again here the State GOP will be in a slightly weaker position than before.

I realize counting Dems out is bad to do – the district’s a hair bluer than 13 – but if Harris at least fits her rural vibe somewhat, Gomez/Alvarez and the House slate unequivocally don’t. The Dems best hope here is just Gowan losing in the primaries.

***hunter15991 Rating: Tossup Dem. Senate. Dem House uncontested. Tossup GOP Senate (John/Gowan), GOP House uncontested. All Safe GOP general.***

______________________________________________________________________________

***District 15***

If the doom and gloom in LD14 has got you down, you may want to try on LD15 for size. Located smack dab in the middle of AZ-06, LD15 is a microcosm of the fight Heather Ross will be fighting in the congressional district as a whole. Although the district as a whole has been red legislatively for eons, in 2016 both Sherriff Paul Penzone and Maricopa County Community Colleges Boardmember Linda Thor posted good results in LD15 – showing a capacity not only for sane Democratic votes, but also f or pro-education votes. 

The GOP field in LD15 is set – former teacher and “moderate” Republican Representative ***Heather Carter*** ($45K COH) is dropping massive checks on her quest to secure the Senate seat in this district, while House Majority Leader ***John Allen*** ($46.6K COH) and incumbent Senator ***Nancy Barto*** ($24K) are running for the two House seats.

The Dem. field is well suited to meet them. In the Senate, teacher ***[Kristin Dybvig-Pawelko](http://www.electkdp.com/)*** ($3.16K COH, Clean – and hereafter KDP) is squaring off against Carter, while 3 Dem. candidates are vying for the two Dem. House nominations in the district. Teacher ***[Jennifer Samuels](https://www.samuelsforaz.com/)*** is running as a ticket with KDP, both heavily emphasizing their education chops. Prosecutor ***[Julie Gunnigle](https://www.facebook.com/GunnigleforHouse/)*** is gunning (pun intended) for the second spot, crafting her campaign around a strong anti-corruption message. Her legal chops are visible in her many livestreams she does, and if she fails at a run here (or for CD6) she’s got a promising practice to return to. 2016 nominee and lawyer ***[Tonya MacBeth](https://electmacbeth.com)*** is the third candidate in the race – although she has not been able to adapt to the competitive primary Gunnigle and Samuels have thrust on her. With Gunnigle taking a lot of big-name endorsements (like Steve Farley) and Samuels pairing up with KDP, MacBeth is on track to get boxed out of the nomination.

In the general, Samuels and Gunnigle dodge a massive bullet, as moderate Republican Heather Carter is running for the Senate this cycle instead of one of the two House slots. While this does sink KDP (her main strength is education, but Carter counteracts that quite nicely), Samuels and Gunnigle have an opening against Allen and Barto. Both incumbent GOP legislators have been vocally against the recent teacher strike, with Allen leveraging his power as House Majority Leader to whip GOP members (like Carter, coincidentally) into line to vote against Dem. bills designed to find some sort of a fix to the teacher crisis. If the Dem. nominees can adequately tie Barto to Allen and Allen to the funding catastrophe in Arizona, then the same metrics that could push Ross over the finish line can push them over as well. The county party realizes this, having opened up an LD office here far earlier than was expected by anyone. 

It likely will remain in GOP hands, but the dark money needed to protect what should be a safe seat for Republicans will absolutely send some Dems across the 50%+1 mark elsewhere in the state.

 ***hunter15991 Rating: Dem. Senate uncontested. Likely Gunnigle/Samuels. GOP primary uncontested. Likely Carter, Leans Allen/Barto.***

___________________________________________________________________________________

***District 16***

Located in deep-red East Mesa and Apache Junction, LD16 is a splash of cold water after such a rosy preview of LD15. Currently held by Senator ***David Farnsworth*** ($4K), retiring Representative Doug Coleman, and Tea Partier/Furry fan ***[Kelly Townsend](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/kelly-townsends-furry-tweet)*** ($32.4K). In the running for the second House seat being abandoned by Coleman are Apache PD Officer ***Stephen Kridler*** ($2K COH), businessman ***John Fillmore*** ($19K COH), activist ***Liza Godzich*** ($20K COH), and moderate-ish ***Tara Phelps*** ($26K COH, Clean). Phelps has been receiving tacit Democratic support in the area, as the Democratic primary (we’ll get to it in a moment) is relatively uncompetitive. Godzich is receiving Townsend’s stamp of approval, which for the most part sets up a Phelps v. Godzich race for the second slot after Townsend. However, a nominally-even race is slanted by the presence of Fillmore and Kridler, who by nature of their platforms are set to pull more from the right than the center. There’s a decent chance a pro-PublicEd Republican makes it through to the general this November.

On the Senate side, Farnsworth is being challenged in the primary by “Big” ***Michael Hernandez*** ($2K COH), an anti-establishment character running a hair left of Farnsworth. Anecdotally, he’s getting along quite well with the Democrat in the race, ***[Ben Carmitchel](https://benforarizona.com/)*** (/u/bencarmitchelforaz - $710 COH, Clean and needs $5’s). Although Hernandez doesn’t seem like he’ll make it to the general, he’s undoubtedly a cheery face this election. In the general, Carmitchel is joined by former teacher [***Sharon Stinard***](https://www.stinardforhouse.com/) ($3.4K COH), as well as by Green Party write-in and former Democratic nominee for WY-AL [Richard Grayson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Grayson_(writer)) ($0 COH). Stinard, Carmitchel, and Grayson all face a touch climb in the general – the best this district can feasibly hope for is for Phelps to make it through the Republican primary.

***hunter15991 Rating: Dem primaries uncontested. Likely Farnsworth, Likely Townsend, Tossup (Phelps/Godzich). Solid GOP General.***

_______________________________________________________________________________

***District 17***

Before I begin this segment, it’s wise for me to inform readers (however many there are) that I was previously employed by the Democratic slate in LD17, before being forced out for what in my mind are senseless reasons. I have tried not to let the firing itself impact my judgement re. this district, but the fact that Dem. staffers in this district (the people I was replaced with) are by-and-large woefully inexperienced cannot be overlooked.

District 17 is a super-crucial district for the Dems this cycle, being targeted both by the state and national DLCC. It’s the home district of ***House Speaker JD Mesnard*** ($143K COH), who is currently running for the open Senate seat in the district. The second Representative, running for re-election, is ***Jeff Weninger*** ($79.1K COH), a backbencher who focuses most of his time on passing bills related to bitcoin/blockchain technology. The party-backed candidate for Mesnard’s old seat is Chandler Vice Mayor ***Nora Ellen*** ($91.7K COH) – coincidentally Mesnard’s mom. They face RN ***Julie Willoughby*** in the primaries, who is receiving a surprising amount of backing from anti-Mesnard forces in the GOP and seems set to make the primary a bit of a slugfest. Still, Ellen most likely will advance to November.

The Democratic nominees for the district are hospital administrator ***[Steve Weichert](http://steveweichert.com)*** ($13K COH) and education consultant/former teacher ***[Jennifer Pawlik](http://jenniferpawlik.nationbuilder.com)***. Both are running on a strong, education-first platform, and when I left were attacking Mesnard for his connection to Ellen and for his poor education votes.

While the district is inching closer to blue (it’s a lot swingier than one would expect) and party support is increasing, I need to take a moment and comment about the staffing situation. After my friend and I were forced out (pay and responsibilities gradually reduced to a token position), staffing duties were handed over to volunteers and political newbies, who requested training from us in practically every aspect of running a campaign. I don’t claim to be a campaign guru myself, but the current campaign manager had difficulty figuring out basic algebra, and an Excel sheets with a pre-generated set of instructions (click this tab for X, this tab for Y).  Combine this with an incredible disdain by both candidates to call for money outside of their immediate circle, and there is cause for concern. Thankfully the party can allocate additional resources to the area, but I don’t know how much they’d be willing to shell out.

The ingredients are all there. The cooks aren’t.

***District 18***

Immediately adjacent to LD17 is LD18 – which is just as swingy of a seat. It is currently – surprisingly – majority-Democrat, held by Senator ***[Sean Bowie](http://www.seanbowieforaz.com/)*** ($123K COH), a moderate Democrat who won this seat in 2016 by running against a Trumpist Republican who turned off a lot of the swing voters in the district. He faces the same Trumpist Republican, ***Frank Schmuck*** (yes, that’s his real name – and $125.7K COH) this fall.

One of his House counterparts, ***[Mitzi Epstein](https://www.mitziepstein.com/)*** ($37.3K COH), winning alongside Bowie in 2016. The second Representative, however, is GOP loyalist ***Jill Norgaard*** ($65.5K COH), a rank-and-file Republican who has had to quickly adopt a moderate stance now that her district is a target for the Dems to fully flip this November. In the general she will face either education activist ***[Jennifer Jermaine](http://www.jermaine4house.com/)*** ($15.1K COH) or DSA activist/pastry chef ***[LaDawn Stuben](http://www.ladawnstuben.com/) ($12.7K COH, Clean)***. While Stuben was able to raise her $5’s rather quickly, most DSA activist attention has turned elsewhere to Westbrook/Phoenix City Council, and her campaign is slowing down just as Jermaine is catching fire. It’ll most likely be Epstein/Jermaine in the fall.

But Norgaard has a competitive primary to fight through as well. Other candidates include former Arizona Board of Regents member ***Greg Patterson*** ($800 COH), former Tempe Union Schoolboard candidate and vocal anti-abortion activist ***Don Hawker*** ($600 COH), and AZGOP minority outreach chair ***Farhana Shifa*** ($17.7K COH). Shifa seems like the most likely 2nd GOP nominee given her party background, but Patterson matches her tit for tat on the resume (yet has a surprising gap in terms of fundraising).

In the general, this seat will be one the GOP tries to take back from the Democrats, in an attempt to return to their supermajority from pre-2016. However, the changing political attitudes in the area are pretty indicative that, if anything, the district is heading further blue this fall. It’s not without the realm of doubt to see a full Dem. slate here – Bowie, Epstein, Jermaine – where four years prior it was fully red.

***District 19***

Thankfully for me, LD19 is quite a snoozefest. Democratic Senator ***[Lupe Contreras](https://www.facebook.com/contrerasforsenate2014/)*** ($73 COH) is running uncontested in both the primary and the general. Democratic Representative ***[Diego Espinoza](http://www.espinozaforhouse.com/)*** ($1.5K COH) is running for re-election, with a noticeable battle for the second House seat ongoing. The decision by Rep. Mark Cardenas to pursue higher office (he failed) led to this seat opening up in LD19. Avondale City councilman ***[Lorenzo Sierra](http://www.sierraforaz.com/)*** ($16.2K COH) is the frontrunner in the race, having secured both Contreras’, Espinoza’s, and Cardenas’s endorsements. But he’s facing opposition from Tolleson Union High School District Governing Board  Vice President ***[Devin DelPalacio](http://www.devinforaz.com/)*** ($2.9K COH). He is running on a strong pro-education platform, but as a former student of Tolleson Union I don’t consider him to be the best pro-PublicEd example in Arizona.

No Republicans have filed for this district, making the primary the general election.

***hunter15991 Rating: Dem Senate uncontested. Likely Espinoza, Leans Sierra. Uncontested general.***

_____________________________________________________________________________________

***District 20***

And if LD19 was a snoozefest, LD20 is a wild ride. A Leans-GOP district in a normal year, it’s receiving a lot of attention from both parties. Three of the four possible races (GOP/Dem House, GOP/Dem Senate) are contested primaries. Incumbent Senator Kimberly Yee is running for Treasurer, leaving the State Senate seat up for grabs. I’ll try to be brief.

On the Democratic side, activist ***[Matthew Marquez](http://www.marquezforaz.com/)*** ($13.3K COH, Clean) and tax auditor ***[Douglas Ervin](https://www.ervinforaz.com)*** ($15.7K COH, Clean) face off for the nomination. Marquez – anecdotally – is running behind Ervin in terms of in-district enthusiasm and endorsements, but the race is still close, and he does a small but dedicated progressive bloc of volunteers. Ervin still seems like he’ll get the nomination, but there’s a good chance at Marquez getting it instead. 

On the GOP side, State Rep. ***Paul Boyer*** ($30.8K) and ASU Professor ***Charles Loftus*** ($300 COH) face off for the nomination. Boyer’s past history in the district and financial advantage make this pretty much a one-sided race.

The House is a bit less packed, but still a wild ride – at least on the Dem. side. The GOP only has two candidates running – conservative activist (And wife of AZ superior Court judge Clint Bolick) ***Shawnna Bolick*** ($93K COH – she has sizable connections), and incumbent Rep. ***Anthony Kern*** ($36K COH).  

The Dem. primary is a bit more packed. Lawyer [***Chris Loftus Gilfillan***](https://www.chrisforaz.com/) ($13K COH, Clean – and yes, middle name “Loftus”. No clue about relation), small business owner ***[Patrick Church](http://www.church4house.com/)*** ($300 COH), non-profit manager ***[Hazel Chandler](https://www.hazelforazhouse.com)*** ($2K COH, Clean) and special needs advocate [***Dan Anderson***](http://www.danforaz.com/) ($200 COH) are all running for two spots for the general. Currently I’d guess that Gilfillan and Chandler will make it through due to their strong groundgame and online media presence, but Church could sneak through in a fluke. Anderson, unfortunately, won’t be making it to the general.

In the general, any Dem. candidate that makes it through will be relying heavily on outside party funds to get them to parity with the massive warchests of Kern/Boyer/Bolick. With the district an under-the-radar target by Dems (it was won by the Maricopa County Recorder, Adrian Fontes, during his 2016 campaign), such cash will be deathly important for flipping both chambers of the legislature. I personally don’t see much hope in the district, but anecdotally real decisionmakers in the party apparatus see it as more than likely to flip.

Here's hoping it does so in November. 

EDIT: Christ, forgot there was an independent running. [Doug Quelland](https://twitter.com/dougquelland?lang=en) is a former Republican Senator in that district running to the right of Boyer. Hopefully he helps Ervin flip it.

You have too much poise and class to give yourself over to some low-life. The weak-chinned and limp-wristed men your father loathes were of no interest to you anyway. A man would need intelligence, money, fashion sense, *and* charm to win you over.

I have all those things, but it doesn't matter.

I only need one thing to win you.

-----

""Where did you get this,"" he asks quietly.

I take a breath to appreciate the moment. It took me months to get this appointment. He's so damn busy, even for a man like me. Always trying to push me off to secretaries and underlings who don't know his darkest secret.

That secret sits atop his desk now, one of only four ripped sheets of parchment, written in the hand of his great-great-grandfather. Two of the other joined halves have been burned. He knows not where the remaining halves to the other two he owns are.

Well, I just put one on his desk.

And he fucking hates me for it.

""Does it matter,"" I note in answer to his question.

""You didn't acquire this legally.""

""I wasn't aware you cared about legality."" He shifts in his seat and I take the paper back before he can dishonor us both. ""Your great-grandfather certainly didn't, when he founded this company.""

Your esteemed father sinks in his seat. ""No. He did not.""

""Then I merely ask you to honor his bravery by -""

""Bravery?"" he snarls.

""...By honoring the document and granting me my favor.""

He stares down at the half-sheet and I know we're making progress.

""It's a forgery.""

""It is not.""

""It's impossible for you to have this.""

""I do. join it with your half if you doubt me. We can test its veracity if you like.""

He doesn't say anything. He knows I'm not lying.

""Even if I accept that this is the lost half of the paper, what do you wish to ask me for.""

I tell him.

It takes all his strength not to leap out of the desk and dishonor his heritage by strangling me in his office.

----

Someday, you know, you'll hate being called into work on a Saturday. For now, you leap at the chance of visiting your dad at his job. You remember playing on the carpet and mimicing him when he was on the phone or playing with his pens, actions he'd chastise you for, but with a hint of a smile. His daughter, and the next up-and-comer in the family business.

You breathe deep of the air in his office, always having loved the smell of money and old tomes when you did. Something's off about the scent today. You open your eyes.

Something isn't off.

Something is very very *wrong*.

""Dad?"" you ask, stepping nervously inside.

""Shut the door,"" he demands.

You do so, then enter the room.

There's another man there with you both. You tense up, but he doesn't move. He's a threat, with his size and obvious wealth, but also not a threat if your dad let him in.

Did he let him in? Does he know he's there? Dad won't even look at this stranger. Why?

""You're being reassigned.""

""What?"" Your internship at the company had just begun! ""Did I do something wrong?"" you ask desperately.

""No, dear."" He grimaces, looking to the side, away from you and the man. ""I did.""

""Come now, don't be so hard on yourself,"" says the stranger, slipping off the wall. ""There's no one to blame here but the ghosts.""

That's true enough, but it's a weak salve to your father's wounded pride.

""You're coming with me,"" I say to you, standing straight. ""I have a role for you to play.""

""I only work for the family business, or one of it's subsidiaries,"" you say sharply.

""Not anymore."" I push the now-joined pieces of parchment to your father, who puts his hand atop them. The deal is complete. You're here, and you're mine.

""Oh, and this isn't a job,"" I add, moving toward the entrance. I let some light in by opening the door.

""My wife doesn't have to work.""

WIFE?

You look toward your father, who meets your eyes sadly.

The answer to any question you may had lies in his sad gaze.

""We'll all see each other again very soon, I'm sure,"" I say impatiently. ""Hurry. Up.""

You turn and stare at me, hating me but unable to show anything but shock. There I am and there's the door.

What else waits for you in the unknown?"

I'm taking summer school now and it's making it hard for me to balance preparing for FM and doing well in my class to increase my GPA. Basically my question is, would it be better to take the Infinite Actuary course (instead of cramming for FM) so I could learn some technical skills or should I focus on FM before focusing on learning Excel and R and take FM in December? If the recruiting season goes past December then I don't need to worry about cramming for FM so soon. Also, should I keep my GPA off of my résumé or be honest and keep it on?

I'm a big Roosterteeth fan and since they just held RTX it inspired me to make this post. I'm looking for someone to play one or more of the Roosterteeth girls (this includes actual rt employees and girls associated with Rt) as Futas. This includes the following:

- Barbara Dunkleman 
- Ashley Jenkins 
- Elyse Willems
- Meg Turney 
- Jessica Nigri 
- Mia Khalifa  (thank God for sportsball)


So now that you know which girl or girls you be playing I have a bunch of different ideas.

- **Personal Assistant** (only play one futa): I'm a new employee at RT and I'm assigned to be your personal assistant. And while I'm good at helping you with your duties you decide to also use me to help with your sexual needs.

- **The Company Release** (play more than one futa  but you don't have to play them at the same time): Roosterteeth has a problem. They have many futas in their employ and their sex drive is becoming a distraction. So it's decided they need to hire an intern help provide release to the rt futas. It just so happens I'm that hire.

- **Stretch Goal** (play one or more futas): RT is having and livestream and they are taking donations and one of the stretch goals is that if they make $1,000,000 a fan will get to have sex with one or more of the RT girls of his choice on stream.

- **photo shoot** (play Jessica Nigri and or Meg Turney) I've been working as an intern for you for a while and we have gotten along great. One day you plan to do a shoot but your photographer cancels and no one else is available so I need to take the pictures which is when I see what's bee hiding between your legs.

I'm also open to suggestions

My kinks include: Futa, Big cocks(I'm talking 8 to 24 inches), Big balls, public sex, filmed sex, creampie, facials, anal and more

I am also planning on taking the American Opportunity Credit, which allows me to take a tax credit of $2500, with a refund of up to $1000. This would mean that I will get a refund of $1000, and owe no taxes.

Payment Amounts is irregular: If you get a bank loan with a variable interest rate, the rate changes with market conditions. This results in difficulty in determining the exact amount of future payments. Consequently, it becomes challenging to make sound financial plans.

Requirements are strict: Because many bank loans require some form of collateral, startups and existing businesses without any assets can find it difficult to get their loan applications approved.

Time-consuming: before one is able to assess the loan you will have to go through a long process of verification which can take a couple of months if not years.

High-interest rates: since the loan is coming from a centralized system the interest rate is unnecessarily high because they will have to pay taxes to the various agents.

False hope: the borrower is always assured of accessing the loan but at the end of the day the loan is not accessible.

HOW DCC INTERN TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEMS

Individuals who are willing borrow will go straight and establish blockchain account to initiate a borrowing request. authorize data service provider and The Data Service Provider will in turn store borrower ’s data on the chain, edit out unnecessary data and generate the basic data standard. Algorithm and computation service providers get required data to analyze it and take decision base on laid down policies. Credit History Feedback The approved credit history reports generated on blockchains prevent problems such as long-term borrowing and repeated test borrowing.

I've been a in-house PPC specialist for just over a year now, and I was hoping to get some insight regarding managing large accounts/platforms.

Background: I've been employed by the same company for just over a year, and prior to this I learned PPC while interning at a company who used Facebook as a sole provider of app downloads. I'm talking a monthly budget of $100k, and part of a three person team (Intern, Specialist, Manager).   


My current company started PPC off fairly slow. They ran little to nothing on Facebook, Adwords or any other PPC platform prior to my arrival, which I quickly ramped up. The whole company has been extremely happy with my results, and they've given me more and more responsibility in attaining large, and sometimes lofty goals.   


Issue: I'm starting to feel worn down by the quantity of campaigns I have to manage. Our business deals with very niche audiences across thousands of locations. At any given moment I am running 50 or so FB campaigns (At one point I was running 125) with a budget in the thousands per day. Now we're planning to expand Adwords, but my time is locked into Facebook. My day-to-day work consists solely of managing what we have at this time, with little to no time set aside to try experiments, new platforms or anything that I believe would give us new avenues/ways to acquire users. I have voiced these concerns, but to little to no avail.   


Every day another task is placed in my lap, and I fully believe that despite taking the time to set up a new platform or campaign(s), I cannot give it the full attention it deserves.

What I would like to know is what is reasonable for someone to manage on their own within a 9-5 job, and what type of salary (Canada/Toronto) should I be expecting? 

Thanks!"
95f9fs,3,2018-08-07,Girlfriend (24F) of 2.5 years broke up with me (22M). Any chance of getting back together?,RaKiPyt,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/95f9fs/girlfriend_24f_of_25_years_broke_up_with_me_22m/,"# Background:

My ex-GF (24F, nurse) and I (22M, medical student), we met around 3 years ago while i was doing an internship (in 1st year of medical school) on her ward in hospital. We first started texting while i was back home (250km from my study place) on vacation, met shortly after when i got back to my study place and kinda ""rushed"" into a relationship after only a knowing each other for 2-3 months. In our first year we had a few up's and down's (i.e. her getting the feeling of inferiority because of me studying medicine and her ""only"" being a nurse, which obviously is not the case) but never ever got into fights or thought about breaking up and eventually got over them. Since then we kinda matured into a much more grown-up relationship. I've come along nicely with her family and friends. Although we have kinda different personalities, we really enjoyed being with each other, spending time together and talked hours about everything happening in our lives over the course of the last 2 years. We had and still have two separated circles of friends and apartments over the course of the years and were both absolutely fine with that.

My ex-GF is a totally down-to-earth girl. Humble, nice and tries to please everybody, in short: she is the nicest and loveliest person i've ever met and probably ever will. She sees herself and her needs not as that important compared to others. She values family and friends and is what you would describe ""attached to one's native soil"". I guess she loved and accepted me just for what I am and never had difficulties with me being a real smartass sometimes. On the other hand if we had any misunderstandings in our relationship she tried to figure out a solution by herself or would wait for the straw to break the camel's back. This made it quite tough for me to realize, if I was doing something ""wrong"".

Compared to her two previous relationships she always called me ""the nice guy"" and being ""very understanding"" when she was acting so-called ""weird"" by herself.

# Current situation:

Over the last year our both lives got much more exhausting, her job as a nurse got much more stressful because of the major shortcomings in healthcare here in Germany, and I've also been much more committed and stressed out by medical school (4th out of 6 years done) and the volunteer work at my local medical students association and because of that both have had a demotivated/negative feel overall (not just concerning our relationship) for the last months.

In the meantime I have been talking to her now and then about studying a semester abroad or even working outside of Europe as a medical doctor (which is not the case anymore), at the same time a good friend of her got pregnant and had to move due to her husband working in another city here in Germany.

The last 2-3 months have been kinda different. We still met each other 3/4 times a week, stayed over night, have enjoyed the time together (for my part), but cut short our weekend/hobby activities together. We felt kinda exhausted. We just stayed at each other's place, just for sake of being around each other.

I started to observe her being much more down than I have been concerning those obstacles in our lives over the last year. At first she tried to ""hide"" it from me (based on me writing final exams at the end of last week ) but after a while she admitted she had this doubtful feeling about our relationship and our somewhat different perceptions of life and did not know what to do about it. I felt really bad at that time, thought about possible solutions and tried to be the most caring friend possible to cheer her up and get us going again but her feelings did not change. Her misery was the worst feeling I have ever experienced and not being able to take away her doubtful feelings made me feel like the worst boyfriend on planet earth. So we sat together, talked about it and broke up about two weeks ago.

The Break-Up itself was everything our relationship stood for. We respected each others opinion, neither of us has been mad at the other one. We talked about everything, cried together and even made a few jokes about the good ol' times. Being the person she is, she set me in charge to keep/not-keep up the contact. She told she needed some free-time (probably her vacation at the end of August) to properly think about those doubtful feelings and the future, but kept vague/ rather negative whether she could foresee a getting-back-together for us.

Since then I've texted her once or twice a day and been at her place one for picking up a few things due to me going home (250km away) and visiting my family. At this occasion we talked and also somewhat cried about the past times.

God dammit! I miss that girl so much!

# 

**TL;DR:** My ex-GF (24F, nurse) of 2.5 years and I (22M, medical student) broke up two weeks ago in a ""rougher"" phase of our lives due to her doubtful feeling about our relationship and different perceptions of life. We had a really ""good"" break up, talked about everything and still text once/twice a day and have met once since then. She told me she would need some free time (probably at her vacation at the end of the month) to think about everything and kept relatively vague concerning giving the two of us a second chance.

* After reading a few things about break up's on this subreddit, should I still go for the strict No-Contact? Do you think it will help the both of us to figure out what we want? Even after two weeks of texting every day?
* Do you think there might be a chance of us getting back together? After everyone got time for themselves and to think about their plans in the future?

*Thank you very much for taking your time to read this! I hope it is somewhat understandable as I'm not a native speaker.*"

It is like that feeling you get right before you play a sport or go someplace you've been dreaming of going or getting that meal you've wanted for so long. It's butterflies, but they feel a lot better. Hopefully that made some sense, it sounded a lot better in my head than on paper, or on screen. But I know I am not the only one struggling with that anxious feeling. I plan on playing a sport and hopefully getting this wonderful internship and on top of school being involved with the community. All of these things I truly am excited for. 

So as a promise to myself and all who will read this, I will continue to go to the gym no matter how hard it gets and I will continue to write no matter how awful I feel. I will sacrifice today to live in paradise tomorrow. I will empty my bucket. I will wake up early and go to bed late. I will continue to grind until I reach the top. 

The next posts I do will include a day and it will be a countdown and journal of my road to success not only in health, but in school and wealth. 

Stay Frosty!"
95gh7l,1,2018-08-07,3 Day a week Nsuns is this viable?,ramkraak,nSuns,https://www.reddit.com/r/nSuns/comments/95gh7l/3_day_a_week_nsuns_is_this_viable/,"Dear Redditors,

First, I want to thank you guys for taking the time to read my post. I shall first begin with a little information why I want to cram the wonderful Nsuns program in a 3 day a week program.

A couple of months ago I already ran Nsuns and I really liked the workouts it provided and the gains that I got. So I already know the basics etc etc. In three weeks I will be starting my internship, this means I won't have the time that I used to have so because of this I'm going to only train three times a week.

Some other things worth mentioning, I mainly want to focus on the upper part of my body  because in my opinion it's lacking compared to my lower body. Also my back is way more developed compared to my chest and arms. So the main focus also will be chest and arms. My goal is not to set powerlifting records by any means. So maintaining my current Squat and DL is ok for me at this point in my training career. My goal is to grow as big as possible (mainly upper body) with the 3 days a week that I have. That is why I came to conclusion that this would be my ideal 3 day Nsuns split:

**Day 1 (Monday):  Upper Bench/Ohp Volume:**

* T1:  CG Bench (9 sets)
* T2: OHP (8 sets)

**Day 2 (Wednesday): +1 OHP &amp; Lower SQ/DL**

* T0: OHP +1 (First 5 sets)
* T1: Squat +1 (9 sets)
* T2: Deadlift + 1 (5sets) or medium intensity 5x5

**Day 3 (Friday): +1 CG Bench &amp; Incline**

* T1: +1 CG Bench (9 sets)
* T2: Incline Bench (8 sets)

This is how I want to order my T1 &amp; T2 lifts. As you can see it kind of resembles the normal 5day a week version, but with a significant lowering in the lower body movements. I also chose to use Close grip on my bench as main lift because when I lift with a wider grip I tend to get a shoulder pain. I would love to hear what you guys think about this and tips are more than welcome! If you guys like it I also can add the assistance lifts that I want to add in the training. Thanks for reading and for the people that are interested my maxes are written below.

* Squat: 140kg 1RM (3plates)
* Bench: 80kg 1RM
* Deadlift: 180kg 1RM (4 plates)
* OHP: 60kg 1RM (1 plate)

Yours Sincerely

Ramkraak"

Im applying to both PhD and PsyD programs this upcoming fall. That being said, I’m not sure if I should wait another year, or if I should apply anyway with the current credentials I have. Here they are:

GRE: 157 V 155 Q 4.5 Writing

Undergrad GPA: 3.66

Research experience: 4 poster presentations. 2 independent projects.  In total, I have 3 years and a half of research experience, having been in 5 different labs while in undergrad

Work experience: currently doing research at a hospital as a research assistant (post-undergrad). I’ll have been here a year and a half. A year at a behavioral health facility co-facilitating groups for individuals with schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, etc. (Internship). I was a Resident assistant (maybe makes me seem personable?). Volunteered over the summer at a research lab in a university, and have volunteered at a research lab at my school while being in another lab for class. In total, I have 4 years and a half of research experience, having been in 5 different labs while in undergrad 

My gpa is low because I typically worked 2 jobs at school, was in a fraternity in an executive position, and had an internship. Also went through a rough patch in my life my last year and have been getting out of the funk recently. 

Any suggestions as to what I should do? Whether I should apply for these type of programs, wait another year, or look for a career elsewhere?"

In the next two years or so I will be moving to Europe, my intention is a permanent move.

Now that I am early in my career the path i go with is where i will build my experience (digital marketing or traditional).

For any reason would anyone recommend I go with or stay away from entry level digital marketing jobs? My goal is to build as much experience and skills within a 2 year period.

Any advice or tips is appreciated, thanks."
95hajp,1,2018-08-07,"GF of 6 years kissed another guy, weird story, need advice",TheThrowawayBrawl,survivinginfidelity,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/95hajp/gf_of_6_years_kissed_another_guy_weird_story_need/,"Ok, a bit of background:
My GF and I (both in our mid 20s now) have been together for over 6 years now.
Since we never were lucky enough to end up living in the same city, going out was always an issue, with each of us having to trust the other not to drunkenly do anything stupid.
Now she‘s currently abroad for an internship, and my only condition for this to work out was „don‘t get too drunk, so nothing stupid happens“.
Well, 2 weeks into the whole thing, she got SUPER drunk and made out with a guy in a bar she met going out. Now, the rest of the story might sound completely incredible, but knowing her for 6 years and never having had any issues of that kind, I just believe her description of what follows:
She realized it was a stupid mistake and told him so. Wanted to get home, but was too drunk to find her way back or call a cab (she was pretty far from her place by that time).
The guy insists that he lives just across the street and won‘t bother her - told her he would just let her sleep. So she goes with him, but surprise, he kept coming on to her. Once he started getting handsy, she pushed him away and eventually left his place, called an uber and got home.
She told me all of this immediately the next morning, under tears, promising she would answer any question i had and be completely honest with me.
Now, i‘ve never seen her this desperate, and I honestly believe that she was telling me no lies. She was truly in a terrible place, saying she hated herself for breaking the only thing in her life that mattered, that she would do absolutely anything to make up for it, that she would cancel her internship and take the next plane to me, and so forth.
But here comes (part of) the reason I‘m posting here:
She was so drunk that she doesn‘t remember everything.
From the time she was kissing him to the time she took a cab, 4 hours had passed.
In her recollection, they went to his place briefly after kissing. She then went to bed and after a while he joined her. He started touching her, she got up and went to the bathroom, had some water and then talked to him on the sofa.
He started touching her again, and she left the place, finally calling an uber and heading home.

I basically have two questions:

1) is there any chance on earth they didn‘t fuck? She remembers pushing him away, and him being super pissed off when she finally left his place. She was fully dressed, he was in underpants. But what the hell were they doing for at least 3 hours at his place? Hours which she can clearly not remember? She certainly wasn‘t sleeping with him just chilling there until after hours he decided to touch her again, so SOMETHING was going on and it‘s driving me insane. She tried calling him but he doesn‘t answer, and she only remembers pushing him away in bed, and then talking on the sofa.
He also offered her drugs, and she recalls him pushing on or towards her face, so there MIGHT be some rape drugs involved. However, this does nor fit with him being pissed when she left, i think?

2) if we assume I believe the whole story, and nothing bad happened in those missing hours - is there any way of coming back from this?
Reading other posts in this sub, my story sounds like a „best case scenario“: no sex involved, she told me hours later, he‘s a stranger she‘ll never meet again, it was her first time doing something like this in 6 years relationship.
At the same time, trusting each other while living in different countries is to me one of the most essential pillars of this relationship. I considered us to be this powercouple that travels the world and is capable of having adventures independent of each other, yet stays closely connected all the while.
Also, I JUST moved into a new flat - we finally get to move in with each other, she will do so once her internship is finished. I organized the place which is incredibly nice and fits all of her needs exactly. I also pay more rent just so we can afford the place that is nicer for her, and we‘re as close as never before, talking about getting married and having kids. This is the worst time ever for something like this. Should I try to get out of my rent contract as long as I can? Move on RIGHT NOW, or is there any chance for us to fix this and make it work again?

Sorry for rambling quite a bit. Any input or similar experience you are willing to share is well appreciated

Edit:
Thanks you kind strangers! Your words really helped me a lot, sometimes it‘s so important to get some outsiders views on things.
The creep just texted her a (very salty) message that they didn‘t have sex and she should stop bothering him. She has his number because they started off as a group at the beginning of the night, and she exchanged numbers with multiple people early on. She‘s a bit desperate to find friends, new city in a strange country and all. 
I obviously can‘t forgive her immediately, she DID something incredibly irresponsible, hurtful and dangerous. But I‘ll try to work it out. Her remorse sounds true, and she‘s really trying hard to offer solutions (i.e. not drinking, never meeting these people again, taking a plane to come see me etc)
Thanks again for all your support!"
95hny4,1,2018-08-07,Looking for advice on career trajectory to become a PM,Im10eight,projectmanagement,https://www.reddit.com/r/projectmanagement/comments/95hny4/looking_for_advice_on_career_trajectory_to_become/,"Hello, I am a recent graduate with a BS in computer science. I had an IT internship with a large corporation while in school. That experience allowed me to land a 6 month contract as a systems engineer with a very well known company right out of college. This position involves designing, testing, and staging systems we create for our clients who are located around the world. Once I'm trained, I will be the lead engineer for between 1-4 projects at a time. For this position I will work very closely with a project manager, a project lead, field techs, and other fellow engineers making sure the system/project is developed according to specifications. We also have some contact over the phone with the client if I understand correctly.

During this time working with the PMs and seeing what they do, I realized that I really enjoy the aspects of project management and would like to transition away from the essentially 100% technical engineer position and into a project coordinator/PM role. I have two questions.

1. Is this experience relevant for the field? I am certainly not the PM but I will be the lead engineer on my own projects from start to finish. I'm guessing it's a lot more relevant that any other run of the mill computer science or IT job supporting a network or modifying old code for a program. My logic is you need to start somewhere and this might look pretty good. How does this look for a stepping stone into the field?
2. I understand you aren't me and don't know everything about my life but what would you do if you were me in this situation in order to become a project coordinator/junior PM/PM as fast and efficiently as possible??? ex. start studying for a cert now? wrong path? try and get contract extended for another 6 months? etc.

ANY advice on anything related to this is very appreciated. Thank you."

Times have certainly changed in the true sense with **Ankita Shroff,** Co-founder and CEO of **SAV Chemicals Private Limited** who was fearless to dream big paving the way to achieve each one of them.

[Ankita Shroff - Co-founder and CEO of SAV Chemicals Private Limited](https://i.redd.it/ngkdm9wr5te11.jpg)

Ankita completed her Bachelor in Computer Engineering from **MIT College Pune** after which she went on to pursue her Masters in Management from Imperial Business College, London. She also completed her Diploma in Responsible Leadership and Sustainable Businesses from Swedish Institute Management Programme and started her career as an Intern working on a Robotics project despite her Engineering degree. This exploring thought made her fall in love with machines. Ankita found her long-awaited path and decided to focus on traversing through the manufacturing sector. She was passionate about starting her own venture albeit her father has a fully fledged real estate business, Ankita wanted to identify her potential through her own experience and SAV chemicals was established on 9th April 2014.

The incorporation was not easy. Ankita was zealous about [manufacturing](https://www.themachinemaker.com) however she needed to be sure of her decision, hence she started surveying the market. Initially, she wrote emails to all her connects and different OEMs to explore the idea of taking up a franchise, which was fruitless. While she was still on the lookout, she was approached by her Taiwanese Classmate, with an offer to start a joint venture collaborating with Taiwan based Cartell chemicals. Ankita once again inspected the market, did a detailed research comprehending the capital investments, the scope and the risks involved, and she made a call after 18 months and signed the MOU. Before starting SAV, she worked on getting bubble tea to India however it did not work out as expected.

SAV team started their company as an adhesive manufacturing company with their biggest challenge of competing with the already established brand names and create a distribution channel in the retail market; this roadblock led them to enter the non-retail market. SAV Chemicals manufactures industrial and retail adhesive which diversifies their solution application in varied fields like the automobile industry, mobile phone manufacturers, shoe manufacturers etc. With their technical knowhow from Cartell, SAV Chemicals has also provided their services to 3D printing. They have a wide range of products like surface insensitive adhesive used for bonding wood, paper or rubber, the metal adhesive used for metal bonding, all purpose adhesive and many more. SAV Chemicals is also setting foot into E-commerce steadily as their new project.

**SAV Chemicals** has now started spreading their wings globally too, offering their services to countries like Nepal and Philippines and they also plan to approach East Asia countries but their idea to create a brand name in the Indian market remains their prime focus. They intend to reach a 20 crore turnover in the next five years by expanding their production setup, increasing their global network and researching the B2B segments. SAV Chemicals is still growing and is focused to raise the bar in the next few years.

She had her challenges, she had her setbacks, she had her failures but her positive outlook, her spirit to have fun while you work and her strategic planning with a discerning mind, made Ankita believe that if she is patient and stays grounded; she will achieve all that she has planned. This belief has brought SAV Chemicals to the next level today with a strength of 25 full time workers.

Her family and friends who have been her support system and her inspiration motivate and inspire her each day to face every minor or major setback with a determined approach. Her partners, Vishal Saraf and Alok Munot who are also her family members have been a constant source of inspiration and are steadily helping SAV grow bigger and better. Today Ankita has established her own identity as the Co-founder of SAV Chemicals and continues to add value to her family business as an Associate Director of Shroff Group. Although Ankita’s exploring mind, nudges her to set out into different fields in the manufacturing sector like component manufacturing for E-cars, Battery manufacturing, warehousing or even hospitality sector any other value add services, she believes in taking one step at a time.

“Consistency and collaboration are significant virtues in the industry, utilizing your network and opportunities and keep socializing and learning from every one you meet every day” are a few words of wisdom from Ankita Shroff who stayed firm on her grounds fighting against the odds to make a mark as an empowering woman.

It isn’t the capital investment, it isn’t the infrastructure, it isn’t the resources; it is the ardent soul that Ankita Shroff possesses that has made her loved ones proud of her achievements and she will continue to inspire us as she relentlessly pursues her dreams.

95jzsj,44,2018-08-08,"My [27M] girlfriend [28F] of 6 months, who used to call me ""soulmate"", broke up with me over text to ""focus on her career"", how do I get over her?",very_confused_boi,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/95jzsj/my_27m_girlfriend_28f_of_6_months_who_used_to/,"Hey. I met my girlfriend when she moved over to my neighboring city for an internship, and things moved *really* quickly and already by our third or fourth weekend that we spent together she asked me if I wanted to be her ""soulmate"" and pretty quickly we started saying ""I love you"" to each other.


I'm a bit of a late bloomer so I'd never actually had a girlfriend before, so even though I probably knew deep inside it was strange to move so quickly with someone I wasn't sure about how long they would be staying, I guess I just wanted to accept it as true because we had so much in common and got along so well.


We'd have a couple of arguments later on in regards to poor communication between us. I'd often feel I was left to be the one initiating conversation about the more important things while she left it up to ""signals"" and assumptions. She'd often deal with stress, anxiety and negative emotions by smoking weed in front of me rather than talking about it. About a month and a half ago we had a pretty big argument and I felt we needed to cool our heads and not be in each others faces as much to collect our thoughts.


Later on I told her maybe we had moved a bit too quickly and should take a step back and allow the relationship to be more ""casual"". I honestly was hoping for us to maybe just ""date"" and not have the expectation of being ""soulmates"" so that we could get to know each other better. I felt the expectations were a big contributor to us getting disappointed and hurting each other's feelings.


We meet once after that and went out for beers and then I spent the night at her place. She seemed quiet and distraught in thought all the way through. I thought she was concerned with personal problems surrounding her family. We never meet after that and again, I thought maybe it was personal problems she had to deal with. Any time I would write her after that she would be very evasive, short-spoken and kind of mean and condescending.


I finally told her two days ago that we should probably break up if we never have any desire to be together, because it was just stressing me out and making me worry. She said she thought it was already obvious that we were broken up since about a month ago and shrugged it off. Yes, I can see the irony in that a relationship where the fundamental problem was poor communication eventually ended via a poorly communicated breakup.


I asked her further about it yesterday and *finally* she told me that she just wanted to be friends and didn't want to get close to *anyone* at the moment, and was more interested in focusing on her career. From the way she was texting me throughout the night it seemed like this was very hard for her to say, and now I understand she had probably realized it was a mistake for us to get so close and wanted to put distance between us, because her work may or may not take her elsewhere.


I'm really gutted. Of course now when I'm typing all of this out, there is an air of ""what did you expect"" written all over it. I really thought we had something special, and I would've stuck with her and fought for this to work out through anything if she'd had any desire for me to stick around, but I know the sensible and only real option now is to respect her wishes and back off.


How do I get over something like this? Maybe I'm asking a very simple ""breakups 101"" question here, but any advice would be welcome in regards to how to get over a person you shared a very strong, instant connection with that was then ripped away from you. I would still love for us to remain friends and be in each other's lives in some form, but for now clearly I need to separate myself from her and get my shit together.


tl;dr My very quickly romantically intensifying relationship with my girlfriend ended abruptly after six months because she changed her mind and didn't want to get close to anyone and rather focus on her career. She used to call me ""soulmate"" and I really thought she was the one. What is the best way to go about this to move on in a dignified and decent manner?"

A little back story I went to college for computer science but had to drop out due to my father being very ill and now I'm a full time caregiver. I worked a job where I was a manager of online sales, for a major retail company but it was more end user support and logistics then software. But luckily my company had a IT guy and let me do a internship with him for about 2 months while working my main job. At the same time I got the google IT support specialist cert and was going to work on my A+ but I got laid off. So I've been applying everywhere for in I.T opening for about 2 months but barley get any response. I'm thinking that I just don't have enough experience but that's all I got.

It was everything I wanted. Maybe I got too ahead of myself and thought prospectively too much.


Summary: at the start of this summer, we met at a happy hour for our internship, and it all sparked from there. I told him how I felt after hanging out a few more times and was confident enough to do so because I saw his phone had Grindr on it. I have never been able to act on anything in the sheer fear of upsetting the other person because I could never confirm if they swung my way or not. He said he shared the same feeling, and it was all perfect from then on.


We hung out almost every single day, always messaging, always showing up to other intern events together. I would always look forward to his smile and embrace every time. He's not from the area though and will be returning back to school after this internship ends, and this is something I knew would be inevitable. I was willing to keep the relationship going though and thought he felt the same. We had a small bump in the road where he seemed distant one day but he reassured me that he loved me. I felt secure after that. 


But then came this past weekend where we hung out, and I noticed that something was definitely off from the start. He was quieter; not as intimate with our conversations; not smiling as much. I was worried but kept remembering that he told me that he loved me, so I then also brought up the subject of long-distance during lunch. He didn't deny the possibility of it but just kind of stayed at a neutral-but-vague consensus for it. 


Come the end of the day, and he seemed like a different person, almost ignoring my presence. I asked what was wrong, and he told me that he didn't think it was working anymore. He felt that the relationship was one-sided and we should stay as good friends. My heart fell to the floor. My thoughts went everywhere. Did I mess up somewhere? Does he hate me now? 


It's been a few days, and I feel just as bad as I did when he said it. I took off time from work and still feel like I might cry in the office. Hell, I don't think I've ever cried this much ever, even from a family member's death. I don't know how I can move forward. Being gay as well, I don't know how I'll ever be able to find someone again that hit so many marks that I looked for in a person.


He wants to stay friends. People have told me that I just need to cut him off to recover, but I could never imagine the idea of just cutting him off like that. That seems too cruel for me and him. But being able to disconnect everything we had before is just, unbearable. I don't know what to do from this point on. I just feel inadequate that I wasn't able to be the person he wanted and evoke the amount of love from him like he did from me.


TLDR: MY first-relationship bf broke up with me. I feel lost, unconfident, confused, and clueless as to how to move forward. He wants to stay friends and I do too, but the process to get to that stage hurts so much to think about. "

However, I have recently come into a situation where I have to work on something else for my family full time while still in new york. However, I am aware that I only have 150 days of unemployment i am allowed to have during stem opt. 

Googling results show me varied responses on the subject of unpaid internships during stem opt, so I was wondering if anybody had some insight in the following suggestion i got:

A friend of mine starts a company based based on my major (digital comm) gets businrss licenses, gets e-verified, and hires me as an employee, albeit an unpaid one. 

Will this not roll in the uscis? Would it hypothetically work if I were paid? Thank you for reading my post."

A gofundme is started resulting in hundreds of thousands of dollars being raised in George's name, which he is repeatedly unable to access.",MikeyDeez,RedditWritesSeinfeld,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditWritesSeinfeld/comments/95mluh/footage_of_george_ravenously_eating_beefarino/,"Cold open:

After being stuck all morning in the doctor's office, George (looking under the weather and dressed in sweatpants) is starving by 3pm. Having misplaced his wallet, he only has enough change on him to afford a can of Beefarino at the first convenience store he comes across. Walking several blocks home, he cannot take the hunger anymore and ducks into the nearest alley. A passerby sees him hacking at the can with his keys and begins to record...


...later that day, the gang is watching a news story about the video after it went viral under the title ""Watch this homeless man taste food for the first time in days."" Moved by the unhindered, animalistic passion with which George consumes the Beefaroni, the public has been overwhelmed with pity for what they believe to be a homeless man at the brink, saved by a can of food.

Elaine is disgusted by the display. Jerry is incredulous at how George is even able to eat the Beefarino ""raw"". George retorts that *""it's already been cooked at the factory; who cares if you warm it up again or not?!""* Jerry insists that the cooking is not only hygienic, but necessary to maintain the illusion that you aren't just eating slop out of a can like it's dog food. 

The local news story mentions that a gofundme started for NYC's beloved ""Beefarino Man"" has raised over $100 thousand dollars. Shocked out of his misery, George is ecstatic that he now has *""a hundred grand out there with my name on it, baby!""*

Kramer remarks that before the Kramerica fiasco resulted in his imprisonment, Darren the intern was working on a theory that you could legitimately make millions off of ""the goodwill economy"", if you started a hedge fund to invest in peoples' tragedies...."

We are looking for writers to join our staff and this can be a wonderful opportunity for any young journalism student who is looking to showcase their stuff and get experience, or just an avid Lions fan who wants to talk about their favorite team.

I even got college credit through the Detroit Lions Podcast where it was an internship and it helped me graduate from college along with helping me lead to other writing opportunities to other websites and has gotten me a great opportunity at a big company.

Read the title,  I'm not going to reiterate the same shit. jk, lol. I'm trying to get a count to see if anyone is interested in learning more about how blockchain works. If you want to learn more about blockchain or just investing in the blockchain/cryptocurrency atmosphere in general, then this would probably be beneficial for you. We'll go over the Pros &amp; Cons of a world with Blockchain implemented, how it works, discuss past, present, and future tends, &amp; much more. We'll also do test trades and keep up with the daily crypto world.

**A little background about myself:**

My name is Matthew Duch and I'm a Management Information Systems major, and I'm going to be entering my senior year this Fall of 2018.  I've been working in the corporate world for the past four years, since the age of 17 - I'm currently 20 years old. At 18 years old, I was hired as an Intern at Snap Inc., parent company of Snapchat, and hired full-time four months later. I worked there for close to 2 years and was just recently hired full-time at Raytheon/NASA - JPL as a Systems Administrator.

I fucking love technology. We grew up with it and I want to learn every aspect of the technological world. I'd love to share my corporate and investment experiences with you all. I believe that we are all the future and we have the power to set the foundation of that future.

Feel free to comment below or DM me directly if you're interested or if you'd just like to speak to me in general. I'm more than happy to answer any questions regardless whether we create this club or not."
95ose5,301,2018-08-08,My boyfriend [19M] got the job instead of me [19F]. He's unintentionally rubbing it in my face but won't stop.,NaCltyyyy,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/95ose5/my_boyfriend_19m_got_the_job_instead_of_me_19f/,"My boyfriend and I both applied for a open position for undergrads at a local engineering company. The position was very appealing; it offered good pay, flexible hours, and was a great resume addition since they're a pretty big company. The application process was long and arduous and extremely competitive and they ended up only  accepting three undergrads out of a final pool of 10.

Boyfriend and I both go to the same school (top five in the US so education-wise we were both qualified) and he majors in CS while I major in Bio with a minor in CS. I hate to turn this into a competition but my boyfriend is smarter than me in a lot of areas. He has a more analytical brain whereas I'm more creative. I have a heftier resume than him and I'm a better at communication. I would have loved for us to both get the job but if not, I was fairly sure I would get it. Also, he only decided to apply after I told him I was applying but that's a whole other issue that I don't want to delve into.

Anyway, we both make it into the final pool of 10 but he ends up getting the job and I don't. I was upset but hid my sadness to be happy for him. I really really wanted that job. When he got the email, he was ecstatic and he was running all over his dorm excited and screaming—I was still in the room. At the time, he already knew I didn't get it so it kinda hurt that he acted in such a dramatic way. He did apologize afterwards.

Anyway, now he's been working there for about two months and it's going great for him. But he unintentionally rubs it in my face a lot. I'm currently working as an intern at a CS lab at our school and of course, I get paid less than him and I have less benefits but I quite like the job. He'll say stuff like, ""Aww, you only get paid 15.50/hr? That's so little, I get paid 20/hr."" Or he'll say something like, ""Hey, we had a sushi buffet today and there was sooo much sashimi. Did you guys get anything?"" Like no, we didn't, obviously. Thanks for asking. Other examples are: ""Look at all the free stuff I got! You get any free stuff this week?"", ""I can't believe I'm getting paid this much to do basically intro stuff."",""I loooooove my job so much.""

I definitely understand that half of this is because he actually likes his job and contain his excitement. But the other half kind comes across as insensitive, though he might not realize it. If I didn't apply for the job and not get it, then of course I wouldn't mind but he knows that I tried super hard to get the job and didn't end up getting it. Shouldn't he know to tone it down a bit?? Or am I being too sensitive?

I want to tell him it makes me sad but don't want to come across as selfish like just because I didn't get the job, he can't be happy about his job.

TL;DR: Boyfriend and I both applied to a very competitive job with good qualifications. He got the job instead of me. He unintentionally rubs it in my face and I get sad. Am I being too sensitive?"

95ppwp,2,2018-08-08,Talking to employer about mental health?,sometimesiactcrazy,BPD,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/95ppwp/talking_to_employer_about_mental_health/,"So i've been working as an intern for over a year now, and so far i've been able to hide most of my mental health struggles. for context: i was diagnosed with bpd in january, but i've been in treatment for two years, initially for depression.

I'm the quiet type and I'm usually very high functioning, so most people don't know about my mental health issues, including my boss. She has noticed at times that I look particularly bad (lol) but I usually just blame it on something phisical, like headaches or period stuff. 

However, hiding this kind of thing is really exhausting. For instance, I've recently started a new medication and it gave me some really bad nausea and I even vomited the other day. But that had already happened the month before and I told her I was sick and went home, but I thought it would be too weird to do that again so I just pretended like nothing happened.

I would definitely not tell her I have bpd because there's very little info about it in my country, but I could maybe say I have depression/disthymia, which is partially true? 

The thing is, I'm affraid she would think I'm weak or something and that might make me miss some opportunities in the future. It kind of has happened before, when I was working as an unpaid intern in college and I had to tell my teacher/supervisor that my mother had depression and that I had to take care of her sometimes. So that made me lose a sort of ""promotion"", even though he later told me I was the best one for the job. I think he was probably trying to protect me, but that was really triggering at the time and made me feel really bad. 

On the other hand, I could use a bit less work or some flexible hours... so I don't know what to do. Any tips?

TLDR: Struggling with my mental health, but I'm affraid to tell my employer because it might make me look ""weak"" and miss opportunities?"

I intend to watch a few others and get any streamed news from those (*Camp Camp*, *Red vs Blue*: The Shizno Paneldox, RT Podcast, etc). Oh, and this list is by no means exhaustive. It is possible (but I think unlikely) that I missed something in the panels I attended, and of course all of the news from all of the podcasts and panels I did not attend.

95pyso,3,2018-08-08,stuffcentral,ALowKnowledgeIntern,PostPreview,https://www.reddit.com/r/PostPreview/comments/95pyso/stuffcentral/,"Howdy,

I have been Googling this situation for a while (2 weeks) and have followed many paths to dead ends.

To describe my situation: I am an intern working at a smaller sized company. I have been tasked with creating a cost effective, scalable solution for a specific file processing job that eats computational resources **on one thread**; However, the file processing that occurs has to happen for any number of users that log in &amp; that can scale from 0-to-alot rather quick. The processing will always be 5-minutes long and is ONLY mono-threaded due to four 3rd-party tools that we use (this cannot change as the algorithms involved are immensely complex and we don't have the power to change them). We are using Window's images for docker because the aforementioned 3rd party tools use COM and we are bounded by this.

The dream setup I have envisioned (that didn't work--reason at end) is using AWS for everything. First an S3 bucket detects a file uploaded to a ""notProcessed"" folder. That invokes Lambda which starts an AWS Batch instance using my Window's Docker image. I set everything up for this workflow only to realize after running my test that Batch doesn't support Window's Docker images! But now I am going back to scouring the web for a more premier solution.

Options:

* I have explored using EC2 but because of cost, I do not want instances to be always running--they also need to be destroyed after their use because of how the processing works. I want them to only be running when a 5-minute file processing needs to start. I know I could use a manager that creates slaves, but I am afraid to say that my time here is limited and building a master's code would take me a while. I am also afraid about how long AWS would take to spawn a new  instances from nothing. Finally, I want each instance to have the minimal resources possible (to save on costs). This means having one t2.micro for each instance that is processing a file because again, the process is monothreaded so it doesn't take advantage of additional power--and the ram usage &amp; file size are minimal.
* I have looked at Fargate but I don't want wasted resources: I don't want traditional load balancing across, lets say, four instances (because each process will need its whole cpu and I may need more clusters if usage peaks); I want instance &amp; cluster balancing where the instances are also ""containerized.""
* I looked a bit at rancher and it looks interesting but I read it was only for Linux machines :(

Also, the time for spin up is very important. It's bad enough that our clients have to wait for five minutes for our files to process but making them wait another 15-seconds for initialization is unacceptable. Our clients could process potentially hundreds of files a day and the slow setup would cost us money via their wages.

Thanks for reading and please offer suggestions!

Sincerely,

I've never met a girl that was attracted to me, and I've gotten the ""you're a great guy, but..."" talk about thirty thousand times. That's fine; Nobody owes me attraction, and I'm not bitter. I've accepted that girls aren't going to be infatuated by me the way they are with my friends. I'm awkward and six feet tall and 130 pounds with patchy facial hair and acne. I'm just not good-looking. This had been kind of getting to me, and I didn't voice it, but I started having panick attacks around people when summer started.

Then, suddenly, this girl that we'll call Alex came into my life. We met at a summer internship, and we got along well. She's far better looking than me, incredibly smart, and gave me more attention than any girl ever has. I somehow finessed my way into a date at the end of our internship, and it was the most romantic night of both of our lives. She made me feel amazing. She told me that I was good-looking, and that she was fascinated by my mind, and that I was kind-hearted, and everything that I thought I would never hear a girl say to me. 

She made me feel handsome, and she made me feel really special. We went out several more times, and we talked on the phone for at least eight hours every day. She was just as in love with me as I was with her, and I felt like I was actually important to someone. She told her family about me, and I drove three hours just to meet her dad. She would blush every time I looked at her, and we cuddled for hours whenever we were together. She told me I made her happy, and that made me happy. I really did feel more important than I'd ever felt.

But I knew it wouldn't last. She lives far, far away, and we knew we wouldn't have time for a relationship once the fall semester began. So when she told me we should just be friends, I agreed. But then she told me that she was scared that we would no longer be as close. I reassured her that we wouldn't grow apart, even though I knew it was a lie. She kept talking through tears (we both struggle with panic attacks), and she eventually got to the point that ruined everything for me.

She never liked me. She wasn't attracted to me. She just thought that our night together was so magical, and that I was such a great person, and she wanted to like me. She told me that she was amazed by how similar we were and how thoughtful and sweet I was, and she wanted to be attracted to me, but she was lying to herself this whole time, and she never was. 

I wish she didn't tell me that. I'd gotten used to what it was like to be alone and unloved, and I was okay with it. But then she came in and gave me a taste of what it was like to be loved by someone, and my life changed. My anxiety lessened, I became more confident, etc. But then she took it all away. I was doing just fine. I had come to terms with being perpetually alone, and she showed me what I was missing. Then, after all the good she did, she made me feel like a delusional idiot. She brought me higher than I've ever been, then she threw me back down to the hell I started in. Everything she told me I was, I wasn't. 
I'm not good at talking to girls.
I am awkward.
I'm not handsome.
I am ugly.
I meant nothing to this girl. I wasn't her partner,  I was imaginary to her. She told me that she had to convince herself to like me.
And now I just feel like such an idiot for thinking that a girl would ever be attracted to me."
95qvio,0,2018-08-08,"I [23M] was loyal to my GF [24F] while volunteering abroad for 1 month, but got in love for another girl. Am back and dont know if I should pursue this passion or keep living my life",genigenes,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/95qvio/i_23m_was_loyal_to_my_gf_24f_while_volunteering/,"Hey all, I would love some relationship advice if possible, please! Thanks for your interest in helping :)

So, me and my girlfriend have been for 1 year and 8 months in a long-distance relationship. We’ve met while studying abroad in an University for 2 months and we are both from Peru (but from cities that are 1 hour away from each by plane). At that time we couldn’t hook up because she had a boyfriend but we connected very quickly… We got very close friends. 1 Year later she broke up with her boyfriend and I decided to visit her. We started dating and we were deeply in love: Talking to each other every day, FaceTiming and sharing lovely messages all the time – she is a very special girl – smart, dedicated, loving and special.

In this almost 2-year period, we have met probably monthly, and for 2 months, we lived together while she was doing an internship in my city. It was full of happy moments and I loved her throughout all time, even though the long-distance made it rough some times.

In September, we will be living on the same city (both of us graduated just now and are going to live there to work in order to be near each other).

However, recently I’ve been a little disconnected from her because of the long-distance, relationship accommodation and a bit of fear of being too young to assume such a responsible partnership. And that implied in a more monotonous relationship.

In this context, this last July I stayed 1 month in Mexico doing volunteer work in my vacation-period (I will be in vacation until September 10). It was a lovely time and I loved the work. There, many women tried to hook up with me but I was uninterested since I value a lot being loyal to my GF and don’t believe instant gratifications makes one happier… However, I became really friends with a woman volunteer from Colombia there.

In the beginning, it was a beautiful friendship and there were many things that I admired in her: her leadership, how everybody loved her and said she was their best friend, how she cared about making the world a better place and how much she cared for other people – also how fun and liked she was. She is also pretty and hot (even though I think my GF is more beautiful).

And we connected pretty well… She loved spending time with me and myself as well, in no bad way… But later, in a party with other friends of us we were drunk and she admitted to me that she wanted to be with me and that I should change my GF to her. I stuck to my loyalty and didn’t cheat on my GF but it was hard, because I liked being friends with her and deep inside me I was already feeling passion towards her.

In the next 2 parties of the volunteers, she again and again tried to convince me otherwise. I said no but stayed most of the time in both parties with her since she was fun/ my friend and there was a bit of sexual tension that I was liking in that moment (even though I don’t like to admit it).

I’m on vacation time until September, and this girl invited me to go to her home in Colombia to enjoy my time there with her (I haven’t said a word about it, but now that I’m back to Peru, I’ve been thinking about it)…

Now, I left Mexico and am Back to Peru and I feel weird. When I met my girlfriend, I could only think about that Colombian girl, and I realized I’m bit passionate about her and even thinking about breaking up so I can meet her in her home… I thought about her when having sex and even dreamed about this girl…

Therefore, I have 2 options here:  
 1 – Break up with my girlfriend and go visit my Colombian friend to pursue this passion

2 – Continue with my girlfriend, travel with her in August and then start living a short-distance relationship in September

I have to admit that right now I want to go to Colombia and have a great time with this girl because I really admired her and she made me feel great. But I have a feeling that is irrational… What will happen after this trip? How will I maintain a relationship us being in 2 different countries? Will I leave my girlfriend just in time we were about to move close and try life being close to each other? Is this girl really that good or am I just being irrational because of how hormones made us feel in the beginning of meeting a person? (since when I began with my girlfriend I also felt the same way…)

It really crushes me to be in doubt and not to be fully commited to my decision, that’s why I need help from reddit. Do you guys think I should continue with my girlfriend, feed again our relationship and be open to see how living close will work out? Or should I follow my now-desire of being with this girl from Colombia?

At the same time, I feel a bit bad for considering braking up with my girlfriend after 1 year and 8 months of Long Distance (since she had to be with me while studying abroad in Europe for 1 year) and we all, especially her, made lots of commitments. For example, being willing to move to my city.

Thanks for reading and hope to find a bit of help from yourselves!

TLDR: I am in a long-distance relationship for 1 year and 8 months  which is about to be short-distance in 1 month. Last month, I was volunteering in another country and made a friend that I admired and liked a lot. I was loyal in that time and the girl admitted to be in love with me. Now I'm back to my country and am thinking way too much about her. Don't know if it's worth breaking a relationship for."

Virtue House is the major conglomerate based in the fictional country of Sadia, South America. Headquartered in Sadia City, Virtue House was founded in 1858 by Maximillian Gonzalez. In its early days Virtue House focused on trade and shipping between South America, The United States, and Western Europe. Today it maintains a global reach and vested interests in over 30 industries, including finance, tech, healthcare, and manufacturing.

**The Five Houses**

The entirety of the world’s economy is dominated by five Houses, each with its own sphere of influence. These Houses trade and do business with one another, but they are also fierce rivals. No House has fallen in 70 years (The Nazi-controlled Bevolkerung was divided up by other Houses after WWII), but the destruction of another House would be a boon to the others, causing numerous buyouts and raids. The names of each House and their sphere are:
 
*Virtue House* - South America.

*King Hill* - England, The EU, and Australia.

*Gosti* (гости) - Russia and the former USSR.

*Noble House* - China.

*Ascensia* - The US and Canada.

Aside from China, East Asia does not have a single House. Japan is controlled by several unaffiliated Keiretsu. Korea has its chaebols. South Asia is likely to have an India-based House by 2050. Central Asia is informally under the control of Gosti. Southeast Asia and the Middle East are without a House. Because there is no single House dominating this populated and economically powerfully region of Earth, most of the other Houses fight for greater control, making inroads where they can and deals whenever possible. *Noble House* has threatened other Houses regarding their belief in total control of the region.

Africa, too, has no central House, though it was once dominated by King Hill and other European Houses that have now fallen. Noble House’s claims on this region are not as aggressive as in Asia, but they still tend to lead the pack in buying out up-and-coming African companies.

**House Operation**

Each House is a conglomerate with strong ties to government. Gosti and Noble House are virtually intertwined with Russian and Chinese politics respectively. The other Houses believe these companies are basically in control of the countries. Virtue House, King Hill, and Ascensia have strong influence on the politics in their regions, but are not controlled by any state, nor do they control politics in a de facto sense.

Every profitable middle-to-large business on Earth is involved with their local House in some way. Some are owned outright as subsidiaries. Others are controlled through majority stock and House employees on their boards. Some are controlled clandestinely. Others are allowed to develop independently before they are bought out. It is unlikely and downright scandalous for, say, an English company to be controlled by Ascensia or a Colombian company to be bought by King Hill, though such events have occurred in the past and will continue to cause strife between Houses. Only Gosti and Noble House can ever buy or fundamentally control a company in their regions.

Each House is a company in its own right, with a Board of Directors, President, CEO, CFO, and all the way down to interns. There is a headquarters in the nearest capital city, usually the largest building downtown. The only people who don’t want to work for their nearest House are the ones who think they’d never be able to be hired.

**El Caudillo**

Every House has a leader who is often mistaken for a traditional figurehead similar to a modern King or Emperor. In reality, The leader - whose title differs by region and lingua franca - *is* the House. No major decision passes in the company without the leader’s go-ahead, and the largest deals are the ones he or she personally handles.

The leader always operates on the top or penultimate floor of House headquarters.

In Virtue House, this leader is known as El Caudillo. Every Caudillo can trace his lineage back to the first, though this is not technically required. To become Caudillo, the man (it has always been a man) must first attain independent wealth by starting his own company, which is absorbed by Virtue House as the first step in his ascension to the role. The final step is finding a suitable compradora.

**La Compradora**

Less well-known is the Caudillo’s assistant. Known as la compradora, she acts as secretary, confidant, stand-in, and slave to El Caudillo.

La compradora is responsible for whatever duty El Caudillo asks. Compradoras have been used to negotiate business deals with everyone except the leaders of the other Houses (leaders only meet with other leaders). She has historically been asked to carry out espionage, honeypots, and even assassinations, whether by her own hand or through careful organization of trusted others. She takes care of simple tasks, like making coffee or typing dictation, as well as complex ones like readjusting the organizational chart of acquired companies or identifying markets for her House to invest. 

Most infamously, la compradora is a sexual slave to El Caudillo. At his whim, El Caudillo can marry his compradora - or marry her to another. These instances are rare. Normally, the relationship between Caudillo and compradora is seen as so sacred and inviolate that no other ceremonies, save for the oath, are necessary. Because El Caudillo takes on an enormous burden in guiding his leviathan of a company to greater heights, he expects his compradora to take care of all his carnal needs. The relationship is usually D/s and extends beyond that. There is a private dungeon in Virtue House, accessible only by Caudillo and compradora. She does not live with El Caudillo but is given private quarters. El Caudillo can call her to his home at any time he wishes; he can enter her home whenever he likes. She may never refuse her Caudillo. Compradoras are never fired and their names are kept on a single document owned by the Caudillo. Her tenure ends when the Caudillo resigns. While El Caudillo’s name and visage are recorded for history, the compradora is not known to exist past her tenure on any public or secret document.

Similar roles exist in the other Houses. King Hill’s Praetor has his calator. The Tai-Pan of Noble House has a tai-tai. The Sachem of Ascensia, currently a woman, has her vice, also a woman.

**Current Era**

King Hill and Ascensia are reputed to be in a slow decline. There’s talk within and outside of their Houses of a merger, yet several factors work against this risk, tradition and pride being foremost among them. Virtue House is not the dominating influence it once was, but is on a tumultuous rise. At the turn of the 20th century, Caudillo Jamie Sade, ‘El Bandito,’ secretly planned to unite the continent under one government, which would be controlled by Virtue House. His tenure was the longest and most infamous in Virtue House history. He died mysteriously, along with his compradora, shortly after WWI, when Virtue House entered a period of decline. Its fortunes have risen since the 1980s.

Noble House was a Hong-Kong based, British-controlled enterprise until 1997, when the colony was returned to China. Though Noble House leadership, including its Tai-Pan, believed the company could operate mostly as it had before, the Chinese government instituted strict new regulations that the British government was unable or unwilling to contest. The last British Tai-Pan resigned, under Communist Party threat, in late 1997. A Eurasian Tai-Pan was instilled in 1998. He held the office for less than a year. In 1998 a Chinese man rose to the title, resigning in 2008, when his nephew took up the mantle. The other Houses are unsure if a 10-year tenure is expected in Noble House; the other houses allow their leaders to resign at will.

Gosti has been inscrutable since its founding after the Revolution. The current Shef (шеф) of Gosti is assumed to be related in some way to Vladimir Putin. While Noble House is equal in power to the China as a whole, Gosti may be much stronger than all of its countries put together - or much weaker. Out of all the Houses, Gosti does the least amount of business with its rivals.


**End Game.**

The goals of each House are as follows:

1. To dominate or to hold dominance over the country, nations, or continent the House considers its sphere.
2. To extend business ties in territories not controlled by a single House, with East Asia currently the greatest prize, followed by SEA and the Middle-East, Southern Asia, and then Africa. A concurrent goal is to diminish the likelihood of an Indian House, though the degree to which the current Houses will cooperate on this goal is debatable.
3. To extend the sphere of influence. Few Houses control businesses in nations other than their own. King Hill controversially laid claim to a California-based technology firm when Ascensia should have been able to easily acquire the company in 2016. Some called it revenge for 1993, when Ascensia (then known as WorldCon) wrested a London-based financial firm from King Hill’s control. These instances are the greatest joys and worst disgraces a House can put in its records. The spheres of influence, as listed above, have remained in tact for nearly a century (Noble House’s absorption by China through Hong Kong notwithstanding). Every House leader knows the spheres of influence are likely to change. Gosti is quite clear in its desires over European businesses. Noble House has plans to take companies and regions owned by Gosti first and foremost, then King Hill, Ascensia, and finally Virtue House. Virtue House itself sees potential in extending its reach throughout Ascensia’s American territory and has already put plans in place to start with the Southwestern US, as well as (unexpectedly, perhaps) Eastern Canada.

The maintenance, fulfillment, or failure of these goals is the responsibility of El Caudillo - and, as a result, his compradora.

**Tradition &amp; Ceremony.**

Each House has traditions, rites, ceremonies, and rituals that make them a cult unto themselves. These practices are kept tightly under wraps and disinformation is often spread through official-looking ‘leaked’ documents, various websites including Wikipedia, and simple spoken rumor. The true nature of the relationship between Caudillo and compradora is known only by the two parties involved and the Board of Directors. The Board itself is not privy to what El Caudillo and la compradora actually do together, assuming they’re able to keep their personal lives secret.

Beyond that, customs passed down through generations are seen as important, often vital. It is up to the Caudillo to know when to abandon a tradition or when to start a new one. Some are involiable based on company law; others are kept to honor ancestors.

**House Histories &amp; Current Leadership**

*King Hill:*

Earliest record of King Hill’s founding dates to 1370, intertwining The Black Prince and The Caroline War with what would be the world’s oldest House. Due to the dubious nature of these documents, The House’s likely founding dates to the 1600s, when it began as a minor rival to East India Company. Regardless, King Hill remains the oldest remaining House on Earth.

*Praetor*: Alan Carver, 2014. A classic Brit’s Brit, Eton and Oxford-educated, gap year working for UNICEF. Attended both Royal Weddings; was not seen on the BBC or NBC broadcasts (was pointed out by the hosts on the RT broadcast). A friend of the former Sachem of Ascensia, but not the current Sachem. Scottish and English heritage shown in his pale features and light-brown hair.

*Calator*: A short, mousy woman in her mid-20s. Shy and polite; derives no joy from business, unlike the Praetor. Educated at Cambridge for Library Sciences, earning a Masters and mid-way through a Phd when chosen as calator. An excellent academic. Skills as a calator unknown.

*Noble House:*

Founded by an opium-smuggler at Hong Kong’s opening in 1863. Grew to become a sprawling British-owned, Hong-Kong based conglomerate. Remained the strongest in the world until takeover by China in 1997. Now considered the business arm of the Chinese government. Some employees from the British era now work in King Hill; others remained in Hong Kong and continued their contracts for Noble House. 

*Tai-Pan*: Sun Wu-Yat, 2008. The second fully Chinese man to run Noble House, after his uncle. Large of build with a shaved head. Most pictures and videos of Sun are stricken immediately from the Internet by The Great Firewall of China; even in the West, images are limited. Much friendlier in person, apparently, than his stoic visage and reputation would have you think. Nicknamed “Yatzee” by his University of Chicago classmates, Sun Wu-Yat did not learn the origin of his nickname until after he graduated suma cum laude in Economics. The board game Yahtzee has been banned in China since 2008.

*Tai-tai*: Sylvia Chan. The first daughter of a high-ranking Chinese government official and an American actress in fitness and music videos of the 1980s. Sylvia split her youth between prestigious schools in America, living with her mother, alongside vacations in Beijing with her father, and occasionally her mother. The dual-continent upbringing did not affect her stellar academic and social life. Fluent in Mandarin, Cantonese, Korean, Japanese, English, and French. A popular series of Taiwanese films feature a recurring female assassin said to be based on her. The character is always the villain.

*Ascensia:*

Founded in 1920 as WorldCon by a confederacy of WWI arms dealers, American bankers, Canadian maple syrup bandits, and actual former Confederate officers. Adjusted for inflation, was at one point the most profitable House in history. Also once posted the greatest losses in Houses history, again adjusted for inflation. Renamed Ascensia in 2002. 

*Sachem*: Samantha Green, 2015. Famous in equal parts for her relatively brief leadership as CEO of a major Ascensia-owned technology firm and for her ‘will she, won’t she’ flirting with a Senate run. Spent most of her life as a university lecturer, working finally at Harvard Business School before beginning becoming the first female Sachem and the third female House leader (King Hill counts two Female Praetorixs, one a Duchess). Enjoys the role greatly and is doing a ‘bang-up job,’ according to King Hill’s Praetor. Openly gay but has never discussed her sexuality in any of her many interviews. Grabbed Eric Trump by the balls before it was cool.

*Vice*: Celia Evers. High school debate champion; college sorority president. Ran a tumblr fan-blog about Samantha in High School. Attended the Ivy League university at which Samantha then taught several courses. Documented as having visited Samantha several times during open office hours, but apparently did not begin a sexual relationship until being chosen as vice. Penned an email to the other House leaders on the second day of her tenure, banning any questions about the ‘special bond’ between the two women. We hadn’t even thought to ask.

*Gosti*:
Founded in 1905 as part of the Tsarist reforms, Gosti was both supporter of and supported by the Bolsheviks. Said to hold more secrets than the KGB. A well-known phrase in Gosti states that “When the Soviet Union fell, Gosti did not hear a sound.”

*Shef*: Petyr Rabinski, 200?. Personal background unknown. Likely former military officer. Listed name is definitely an alias. Other pseudonyms are unknown. Sun Wu-Yat has, in a roundabout way, admitted to knowing no more than the other Houses about Gosti’s Shef (‘Chief’), and has offered excellent bargains in exchange for intelligence. No offer has been forthcoming. Likely related to Putin by blood and has been seen with the Russian Premier more frequently in recent years.

*Devuska*: Anya Stolitzara. Winner of Miss Moscow sometime before becoming devuska; won Miss Russia sometime after. Blonde-hair, blue-eyes, large breasts, perfect smile. Desperately wants a baby.

*Virtue House:*

Founded in 1858 by Maximillian Gonzalez, who used his boat, *La Virtud,* to transport crops from South America and cotton back to the continent. Grew to be a major shipping and transport company and nothing else until the turn of the century, when Jaime Sade dominated both House and region for his record-setting run as Caudillo. A notoriously quick-tempered and sadistically brilliant man, 'Bandito' Jaime used Spain's loss in the Spanish-American War as a jumping point for a new nationalism that brought his beloved Virtue House new industries and a fame in Latin and South America that would be considered disadvantageous today. His ultimate goal was to unite the continent under one government, which would be controlled by Virtue House, with Mexico acting as a buffer state between his House and the soon-to-form WorldCon House in El Norte. Died under mysterious circumstances in 1919, just days before the 20th anniversary of his tenure as Caudillo. The bodies of Jaime and his compradora have never been found.

Virtue House was the first to institute a Board of Directors, largely in response to Jaime's seemingly unlimited power. All Houses (except perhaps Gosti) have similar Boards to which the Caudillo or leader can be held accountable. In practice, enforcement from the Board is rare.

Virtue House weakened post-WWII, when the American Government (backed by WorldCon) began to meddle in elections in South America. Virtue House was forced to rely on dictators and juntas which often changed and could be greatly unkind, even violent, to Virtue House and its employees. With a wave of democratization in the 1980s, Virtue House was able to reassert control over the nations, and now stands on the precipice of greater global dominance.

*Caudillo and compradora*: Me and you!

Am back and dont know if I should pursue this passion or keep living my life",genigenes,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/95qw95/i_23m_was_loyal_to_my_gf_24f_while_volunteering/,"Hey all, I would love some relationship advice if possible, please! Thanks for your interest in helping :)

So, me and my girlfriend have been for 1 year and 8 months in a long-distance relationship. We’ve met while studying abroad in an University for 2 months and we are both from Peru (but from cities that are 1 hour away from each by plane). At that time we couldn’t hook up because she had a boyfriend but we connected very quickly… We got very close friends. 1 Year later she broke up with her boyfriend and I decided to visit her. We started dating and we were deeply in love: Talking to each other every day, FaceTiming and sharing lovely messages all the time – she is a very special girl – smart, dedicated, loving and special.

In this almost 2-year period, we have met probably monthly, and for 2 months, we lived together while she was doing an internship in my city. It was full of happy moments and I loved her throughout all time, even though the long-distance made it rough some times.

In September, we will be living on the same city (both of us graduated just now and are going to live there to work in order to be near each other).

However, recently I’ve been a little disconnected from her because of the long-distance, relationship accommodation and a bit of fear of being too young to assume such a responsible partnership. And that implied in a more monotonous relationship.

In this context, this last July I stayed 1 month in Mexico doing volunteer work in my vacation-period (I will be in vacation until September 10). It was a lovely time and I loved the work. There, many women tried to hook up with me but I was uninterested since I value a lot being loyal to my GF and don’t believe instant gratifications makes one happier… However, I became really friends with a woman volunteer from Colombia there.

In the beginning, it was a beautiful friendship and there were many things that I admired in her: her leadership, how everybody loved her and said she was their best friend, how she cared about making the world a better place and how much she cared for other people – also how fun and liked she was. She is also pretty and hot (even though I think my GF is more beautiful).

And we connected pretty well… She loved spending time with me and myself as well, in no bad way… But later, in a party with other friends of us we were drunk and she admitted to me that she wanted to be with me and that I should change my GF to her. I stuck to my loyalty and didn’t cheat on my GF but it was hard, because I liked being friends with her and deep inside me I was already feeling passion towards her.

In the next 2 parties of the volunteers, she again and again tried to convince me otherwise. I said no but stayed most of the time in both parties with her since she was fun/ my friend and there was a bit of sexual tension that I was liking in that moment (even though I don’t like to admit it).

I’m on vacation time until September, and this girl invited me to go to her home in Colombia to enjoy my time there with her (I haven’t said a word about it, but now that I’m back to Peru, I’ve been thinking about it)…

Now, I left Mexico and am Back to Peru and I feel weird. When I met my girlfriend, I could only think about that Colombian girl, and I realized I’m bit passionate about her and even thinking about breaking up so I can meet her in her home… I thought about her when having sex and even dreamed about this girl…

Therefore, I have 2 options here:  
1 – Break up with my girlfriend and go visit my Colombian friend to pursue this passion

2 – Continue with my girlfriend, travel with her in August and then start living a short-distance relationship in September

I have to admit that right now I want to go to Colombia and have a great time with this girl because I really admired her and she made me feel great. But I have a feeling that is irrational… What will happen after this trip? How will I maintain a relationship us being in 2 different countries? Will I leave my girlfriend just in time we were about to move close and try life being close to each other? Is this girl really that good or am I just being irrational because of how hormones made us feel in the beginning of meeting a person? (since when I began with my girlfriend I also felt the same way…)

It really crushes me to be in doubt and not to be fully commited to my decision, that’s why I need help from reddit. Do you guys think I should continue with my girlfriend, feed again our relationship and be open to see how living close will work out? Or should I follow my now-desire of being with this girl from Colombia?

At the same time, I feel a bit bad for considering braking up with my girlfriend after 1 year and 8 months of Long Distance (since she had to be with me while studying abroad in Europe for 1 year) and we all, especially her, made lots of commitments. For example, being willing to move to my city.

Thanks for reading and hope to find a bit of help from yourselves!

TLDR: I am in a long-distance relationship for 1 year and 8 months which is about to be short-distance in 1 month. Last month, I was volunteering in another country and made a friend that I admired and liked a lot. I was loyal in that time and the girl admitted to be in love with me. Now I'm back to my country and am thinking way too much about her. Don't know if it's worth breaking a relationship for."

I’m my own worst enemy. Today I really let myself go mentally and gave in to a lot of my cravings. I definitely went over my calorie intake and feel absolutely gross, which has just contributed to my bad mentality right now...so here I am posting and hoping it gets me out of this funk! 

I’ve been really good this summer since I’ve been working almost every day, but my last day of my internship was last week and I’ve had this whole week off (I’m in grad school and have to do tons of internships). I’ve noticed these past few days that being alone in my apartment, while something I’ve always looked forward to, is not a good thing for me. I get bored, let myself snack (all throughout the day), convince myself I can go to the gym the next day or the day after, and just binge watch tv all day.  These are the habits that got me to where I was 10 lbs ago, but also just isn’t good for me mentally. I get in these funks like this that sometimes take me a bit to get out of...the motivation is just gone. As I said above, today was the worst day. I totally overloaded on carbs, didn’t commit to the plan I had for the day, and just gave up.... 

I can’t let myself do this anymore, I need to go out in the world and stick to a schedule or I know I’ll keep having days like this. I’ve planned out my day tomorrow and I WILL follow it. I even made sure to make plans with friends too so I’ll definitely get out of the apartment at least once. 

If anyone has similar experiences, I’d love to hear about some of the things you do to snap out of it! 

This sub has helped me a lot with accountability, so thank you so much! If I didn’t have it, I’m not sure I would keep trying. "

I am trying to get into a Big 4 firm, KPMG in particular because I feel  it is my best shot. I have no internships, all I have is work  experience from previous jobs but they were not accounting related.

I  read KPMG website that they hire recent graduates within a 10 month  window from graduation. I went to some of the spring careers fairs, but  they were only hiring for summer interns and were not looking for  seniors.

Please, how can I connect with  KPMG and get an internship or be hired if I am no longer a student!? It  seems the only way is to be a student and apply through Rutgers job  board.

I know there are smaller public  firms, but I would like to get into KPMG. If I go to career fairs, I  will probably likely need to be a student to even be admitted to the  fair as I am not sure how the upcoming Fall career fairs are structured.

Do I have any hope? Just feels like I am out of luck because I already graduated.

I  applied when I was still a student to KPMG but it was not for their  main service lines, rather a support role. They phone interviewed me but  I was declined anything further."

About 2 months ago, I upgraded from a 5x5 program to a PPL 5 - 6 days a week.   My girlfriend has been gone for 4 months for her doctoral internship programs and in 2 weeks, I'm flying out to Colorado and driving back with her.  We'll be crossing several states, doing some camping, hiking, etc on the week road trip back west.

I'd REALLY like to maintain my routine while on vacation, however there will not be a single gym / facilities that I'll have constant access to.   I'm curious if there has been anyone with experience in this sort of thing.   Unfortunately my gym doesn't exist in most of the states we'll be driving through, at least not without a 5 hour drive out of the way.

Do gyms offer day passes generally so I'm not married to locating a single gym?   I welcome any advice / options especially for people with traveling experience of how you maintain your routine while away from home.

Thanks!"
95ram2,19,2018-08-08,Does your Nparent have these qualities?,crikurae,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/95ram2/does_your_nparent_have_these_qualities/,"So, I just discovered this community, and I'm going to go on a tangent through the form of a list of personal qualities. I made this as both a rant and a way for others, and myself, to empathize with each other. Feel free to comment if any of them seem relatable.

1. **Conditional Love.** Now, isn't this a big one? Instances where you didn't come home on time from a playdate, so Nparent didn't make dinner for you. Or, the ""ignoring game."" Oh boy. You upset Nparent because you didn't clean the dishes, or you lied to them about something as mundane as how much homework you have. Then, they proceeded to ignore you for the next 24-48hrs. They'd pretend like you didn't exist. Higher points for those who had to endure this with a stay-at-home parent. When you called their name, they'd ignore you. They'd slam doors in your face. They'd purposefully look in your direction, make eye contact with you, and make a point to look away, not say anything, and walk to their office/room. You can remember the distinct shift of you, as a younger child of 5-10, begging them of what was wrong, towards you as a teenager just brushing it off as, ""Whatever, they're just ignoring me again."" If you tried to apologize or ask what's wrong (in the times they did this for seemingly no reason), they'd blatantly ignore you, or say something like, ""Isn't it obvious what's wrong?"", or, ""No. I can't forgive you."" Really did well for my interpersonal relationship skills as a fucking adult. Thanks.
2. **Threats.** This ties into the theme of ""conditional love,"" but is slightly more violent. You can remember the numerous times you were told, ""Behave this way, or I'll kick you out of the house tonight."" Usually, they were empty threats, but sometimes they were carried out, so you were required to be on your toes at all times. Another huge one that really rocked around my perceptions of reality was when my Nparent sent me a letter while I was in college, demanding that I not pursue digital media, and to instead pursue the sciences as I had already dreamed of since a young age. Nparent even scanned images of my drawings from when I was 3-4, depicting my ""Dream of what I want to become \[an astronaut\])"". Nparent told me that if I didn't pursue science in college, they'd kick me out of the house after college and provide no financial support. Which is pretty difficult to do with the cost of renting in cities where my predominant job offers would come from, and where pay like $11/hr is considered ""livable."" Nparent doesn't like listening to your insisting that you want to live your life doing something that doesn't align with what they want. This was all besides the fact that I'd went to do an internship at MIT for a few weeks at the end of my high school career to ""test the waters"" of research science, and the overall environment. Let's just say I really didn't like it. It's not for me. If I don't like the lifestyle at such an elite, supportive school with a very kind advisor, how could I possibly pursue a full career in it? Of course, I'd tried to communicate this to my Nparent, but to no avail. Nparent denied what I felt and said pursuing science is the only way to make money in this world, and that I owed Nparent something for Nparent raising me. I will touch on this a bit more, later, but it's further emphasized by this concept of ""[Oyakoukou](https://jisho.org/search/oyakoukou)"" in Japan, where the child owes the parent, whether it be physical or financial support or living up to your parents' career standards. Yeah, it's pretty fucked up, and an old concept now, even in Japan, but still my Nparent clings on to this like there's no tomorrow to justify them essentially threatening me.
3. **Intolerable Culture Divide.** I experienced this, and maybe you did, too. My own Nparent is Japanese, grew up in Japan, and had a constant extreme standard of expectation of how I should act, behave, talk, eat, do homework, etc. While I was expected to embrace every single Japanese attitude and behavior possible, my Nparent was incapable of embracing, or at least respecting, any part of American culture. In fact, Nparent had open disdain for American culture, making forming my own perspective of the world incredibly difficult. My childhood brain would see a set of actions other people did, and think, oh, other people can do that, so I can, too! But then, when I unknowingly did them in front of my Nparent, they'd not only criticize me for not following Japanese culture, but also mock and ridicule ""Americans."" This could be how I eat at the table or how I hold a pencil. And no, I don't think I'm complaining just to complain; she never gave up, and still yells at me to this day for how I hold a pencil, or sit (slouch, I suppose) at the dinner table when I'm home. Now, I've been speaking very vaguely; what do I mean? What I mean ranges from something as small as what kinds of foods the family ate (Nparent always made 3 meals a day, and bragged about how much superior Japanese foods are to American food, and how inadequate American parents are compared to Japanese parents at providing food for their children). And then, it can range to her expectations of me to study until the AM even in elementary school (I attended your usual American public school, plus a Japanese weekend school. Three words: it's intolerable fucking hell. Oops, four words. W/e) Nparent'd tell me that because I was Japanese, I had to study until 1, 2AM on the weekends for my weekend school, because I was so much better than the other American kids- I don't know, intellectually, physically, mentally superior- for being able to do an ungodly amount of work as a child. Whenever I complained about how much I hated this and how unfair it was that other kids could hang out and sleepover on the weekends, she'd repeat a similar tangent to the previous sentence. It's given me a superiority complex that I've had to work on, myself, as a growing teenager and adult, because no one wants to be around a fucking intolerable bigot. Too bad my parent couldn't figure that out before they became an adult.
4. **You've Never Heard the Words, ""I'm Sorry.""** Apologies are simply not a thing among Nparents. I am amazed at how I've literally *never* heard these words come out of Nparent's mouth. At least, not genuinely. There's no sense of forgiveness for their actions, no sense of introspection. They'll either just ignore you or say, passive aggressively, something snarky like ""*Fine*,"" and you're expected to be satisfied with that as a token of their wrongdoing. Like, okay. If they do apologize, it's because someone else is watching and judging them, or because they don't want you to hate them.
5. **Putting down Your (Nparents' child's) Abilities in Comparison to Theirs.** ""I was better than you at cooking as a kid."" ""I was the lead on the softball team; you're not doing any sports, you're basically nothing, compared to me."" ""I aced every single one of my tests as a child (Yes, I really heard this over and over), and you're not. Do you even study?"" Your Nparent absolutely *loved* to put you down at any given opportunity, even when you were as young as 4, 5 years old. Ever since you can remember, your Nparent was putting you down for not being fucking \*perfect\*. Get a 96% on a chemistry exam? Too bad, Nparent got a 98%. Won your baseball game for your team? Nparent won *all* their games as a teenager. Completed undergrad? Too bad, they graduated from their Masters program, with honors, on a full scholarship. I myself notice that this happened often when I was a child, but not so much as I grew up into my later teenage years. It's just,* it's such a clear sign of insecurity and low self-confidence, that how could Npare*nt not possibly notice it themselves? It's almost pathetic, except for the fact that it left me/you with insecurity problems yourself that you need to work on. As a side note, if you ever asked them for evidence of their physical/athletic/musical/intellectual superiority, they'd tell you it's just ""gone"" somehow. Yeah, okay.
6. **Exaggerating your (Nparents' child's) Accomplishments.** Now, how could this possibly work with the above quality? Oh, it sure can if you have an Nparent, and I'm sure you've had moments where you complained about this particular quality to a friend, just to have them say, ""Isn't that a compliment, though?"", or, ""Well, they're trying to be supportive!"" I personally see #4 tends to happen in a child's younger years, but then it grows into #5 as the child grows older, because the parent starts to realize their child *is* amounting to something, which Nparent also surely is, and now they can freely live through their child vicariously. This quality tends to come with a whole bunch of putting down others in order to boost how good their child's accomplishments seem to be. ""You were so good at that concert! So much better than the other kids. They were all miserable players. But your piece was so beautiful, everyone was entranced,"" Nparent says. At first, things like this used to make you a little happy (Ohh, some positive words about me, for once? Give me more!) But you soon realized it was all overexaggerated, self-inputting, self-aggrandizing bullshit. Enough times of hearing how incredibly amazing your grades are compared to everyone else, or how much more *better* you are than ""the other kids"" at whatever fucking activity, and you start to realize, *""Oh. They're just projecting themselves onto me, or living through my accomplishments, or making themselves feel better through my accomplishments. None of it's* really *genuine.*"" Sure, maybe your piece was played well, or maybe you were in pretty advanced classes. But that doesn't mean your parent should act like you're the fucking up-and-coming mathematical genius, and that everyone else is horrendous at everything compared to you. Now, what's the most painful, is for those of you reading this entire essay, going back to the letter Nparent wrote me in #2: I told Nparent about how upset it made me, they ignored it, and then a few months started touting how amazing of a digital artist I was, and how smart I was and accomplished, and how much they ""always knew I could do it."" Oh, what is that smell? It reeks of bullshit, or an inability to accept wrongdoing, or both! This also gave you some serious psychological shit \*cough\* superiority complex, again \*cough\* to work through- namely, not being able to handle others being better than you at an activity, and having a breakdown because your friend plays piano better than you. Not the best quality to have, not the most fun quality to work on.
7. **Controlling Behaviors.** Nparent insists you keep trackers on your phone whenever you go out, ""because what if you get in a car accident?"" You know what fucking happens? I die. Or I get injured. And I have my IDs on me, so the police fucking calls you. I don't see how staring at a tracker 20 hours a day in anyway accomplishes this more efficiently. And the worst fucking part is, you were *never* a problem kid. You've never done anything extreme that warrants this controlling behavior. I didn't (and still don't) do drugs for personal reasons, I don't party, I don't sneak out. I was well-behaved and did well in school and extracurriculars, so why the hell do I deserve this shit? I shouldn't be getting screenshots of my location on an app, demanding why I'm there (I'm at a store on the way home from school.) I shouldn't have to see you demanding of my other parent *why* they were at a particular location during work; were they cheating on Nparent? (Wow, it's almost as if GPS *isn't* perfect?) Trying to explain these reasons doesn't work, because Nparent's not using rationality; they're driven by fear. And apparently, because Nparent is terrified of me getting fucking obliterated in a head-on, or getting lost and murdered in the city, Nparent has to be hypervigilant and stare at my personal dot on a map. Yeah, okay. Now, I may say I'm somewhat lucky because I had a panic attack in front of both of my parents about them tracking me on my phone (I'm close with my non-Nparent), and non-Nparent yelled at Nparent. The circumstances weren't great and it still pisses me off to think about, but at least Nparent was forced to stop tracking me. Now, I'm still only ""somewhat"" lucky, because Nparent has continued to act pissy and bring it up oh-so-nonchalantly in conversations that Nparent can no longer see where I am at all times, which upsets Nparent oh-so-much. Yeah. Fuck you. Nparent also continues to demand of me where I'm going, with whom, and what I'm going every single time I go out, despite the fact that I've been a legal adult for a while now, and any vague response like ""out with friends to town"" will warrant Nparent stepping in front of the door and demanding of me where I'm going. Or, Nparent'll just return to the ignoring game, as always, and try to make me feel bad. Which it still does because I'm not inhuman; I just don't react to it anymore. Either way, still upsetting and pretty sickening.
8. **Clinginess.** As you grow older and older, and start to separate yourself from your Nparent, they try to latch onto you like gorilla glue to skin. They invite you to go out to eat, to go to the city, to go hiking, to go to the beach, whatever relevant activity have you. They try to be your 'best friend.' Now, personally, aside from the Nparent behavior, I just don't get along with my Nparent. They're just... boring, as a person, and our senses of humor don't align. All I'll say is, Japanese people don't understand sarcasm (at least the darker shades of it), and that makes life... difficult? Unfortunately, Nparent doesn't have many friends (which I will touch on later), doesn't hang out with their spouse much, and always seems to want to hang out with you. Even if you're clearly busy, they'll put on a pouty face, use puppy dog eyes, and beg for you to come with them to the mall, or to the beach, even when you just don't want to. When you say ""No,"" it's like you just killed a puppy in front of them, and they get all pissy and stomp off. Like, okay, I don't know many people who get *that* upset because I turned them down to go shopping. It's like Nparents' happiness depends entirely upon your happiness, and *not* in a good way. And it makes you feel uncomfortable to bring it up to Nparent- scared, even. You don't know if they'll just roll their eyes at you, scoff, and walk away, or get angry and start shaking fists. There's almost never acceptance that they could possibly be wrong.
9. **Superficial Relationships, No Real Friendships.** I think this is a particularly dangerous one. Your Nparent doesn't seem to have any support network of any support. All of their relationships from work appear entirely superficial. (Nparent also brags about how much they love to talk about you, and how amazing you are to their coworkers, but that's besides the point). They never cry. They never talk with their spouse about emotional issues. They never talk to *you* about emotional issues. *Ever*. And that's a hard rule. They don't have any meaningful friendships- it seems they've lost all of their friends from how much work they cultivated in your upbringing, and now, they have no one they can call or email or text when they're upset. The idea of suggesting therapy to them is laughable (You can remember years of them yelling at you for crying, for being upset; of them denying you have any mental illness, and telling you to shut the fuck up and leave their sight; of them ignoring you when you'd hurt yourself in front of them because you were so utterly *desperate* for someone to care. The idea of them sending you to therapy took enough years and enough work - for me, it was 5 years - the idea of *them* embracing therapy is impossible to fathom). This system calls for a very unhealthy individual who's not willing to talk to others about their problems or feelings, and someone who isn't willing to introspect. At a certain point while raising a child, I believe that's necessary.
10. **You've Inherited Their Traits, and You Hate Yourself For It.** This is probably the most painful one. You went from being able to blame your irrational behaviors as a behavior on your parents' awful behaviors around your teenage years, to having to deal with them yourself as an adult. It really fucking sucks that you've inherited their controlling, manipulative, narcissistic tendencies, and it influences your closest friendships and relationships. I happen to notice it affects my romantic relationship the most, where it's been the hardest for both of us. It horrifies you to see you repeating the same actions Nparent did; it makes you feel sick to your stomach when the way you ask where your SO is out at night parallels the way your Nparent did. It makes you feel sick even moreso to think of yourself repeating these same behaviors to your own children, and it discourages you so damn much from having children. Like, why did someone *else's* shitty behaviors have to influence me to this extent? Why do *I* have to go to years of therapy for this shit; to ""fix"" myself? God damn. This one really sucks.

TLDR; Nparents suck, there are a lot of qualities that I seem to share with everyone else, rate comment subscribe for more videos, let's empathize in the comments."

95rzzf,31,2018-08-08,How do I stop eating like shit?,feedbackplz2,Residency,https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/95rzzf/how_do_i_stop_eating_like_shit/,"Basically what the title says. I used to be really good about food in the past several years (lost 80lbs in college and kept it off). Even during MS3 rotations I managed to eat clean and exercise.

But now... ever since internship my eating habits have gone to hell. I don't have time to make a healthy breakfast during mornings so I go to work on an empty stomach and pre-round, then grab a snack in the resident lounge... which happens to be sugary high carb breakfast bars and stuff. Then for lunch I have an immense craving to eat unhealthy. We're talking big plates of pasta, pizza, Chinese food drenched in oil, etc.

I don't know why this is happening. I tried eating completely clean a few days last week (fruits, salad for lunch, etc) and felt utterly miserable and cranky by the end of each day. Eating like a pig is literally the only thing keeping me afloat mentally. I don't know why this is happening... maybe it's cause I've never had to work 13 hours a day 6 days a week, and my body is rebelling.

Things I have tried unsuccessfully:

- drinking shit tons of water. Guzzling ~~half a liter~~ 33oz in the morning before leaving my house. Another ~~half liter~~ 66 spread throughout the day, bringing my total to ~~1L/day~~ 100oz a day which I think is 3L. Hoped that would help fill my belly. It didn't.

- Preparing breakfast the night before. I usually am so exhausted every evening I don't wanna do anything. I usually work out, but that takes all my willpower. After that I just sit on the couch or study for Step 3 and fall asleep. I did try to pre-make eggs... but even when I eat them at 4:00 in the morning, I'm still hungry after prerounding. So it didn't replace the sugary breakfast bars, it just added to the total breakfast calories.

- Eating clean for lunch. As noted above, it wrecks my mood for the rest of the day.

I know this is gonna sound funny to some people but I'm actually really depressed about this. Anyone else going through something similar? What can I do?"

I would love some insight into how going straight to industry or government is. I’m kind of concerned about the salary as I am in a HCOL area of these paths. Also I have a lot of ambition and I am willing to work very hard, but I am also concerned that, that may not be noticed in an industry or government setting. Any insight from people that went straight into these fields would be much appreciated. I will still be applying to the other Big 3, but at the same time I feel like maybe those aren’t meant to be on my path either. I do however really want to feel as if I achieved something great in my life, but maybe Big4 just gives you that allusion? "

At the end of the internship I received a full time offer, and while I should be happy about receiving a full time offer before my last year of college, I'm thinking of declining the offer. 

Throughout the summer, I enjoyed what I did, the company culture, the people, the work, and even the clients! However, I expressed an interest in a sub-service line that isn't available in my city, and here is where the problems started. My recruiter was very supportive of the idea at first, but told me we have to be strategic about the way I bring it up to my counselor (weird I know). She told me she would get to work right away and see if we could make the transfer. When I mentioned it my counselor, she was very unsupportive of the idea. She asked me why, and I told her why. I told her the sub-service line that I was looking at was much more aligned with my experiences and major. She then proceeded to tell me that if I wasn't serious about the service line that I was currently in, that I should let them know ASAP - so that way they knew not to give me a full time offer because they didn't want me going back to campus to look for another job. She then told me that the company was no one's second choice. While I understand her reasoning I though it was rude. I did in fact enjoy the work that I did in the service line I interned in, but like I said I thought my major would better suited somewhere else within in the firm (I also liked the firm a lot). 

I had a feeling I would have had to reject a potential job offer, but I thought my counselor would be supportive of the idea. After I had that conversation with my counselor my recruiter soured and told me the same thing but in a much more professional manner. Eventually, they told me to decide between staying where I am, or rejecting a potential offer and interviewing somewhere else. Since, I didn't feel supported enough to reject the offer and interview somewhere else I eventually told them I would stay where I am which was a little stupid of me, but I was under a lot of pressure to decide. 

Since, the internship ended I've learned of other firms that have sub-service lines in my city that have what I want to do. I'm really stuck between accepting the current offer I have or rejecting the offer and interviewing for a potential job. 

On one hand my brain is telling me to accept and relax before school starts, but my gut is telling me to interview for my dream job. I'm really stuck on what to do!

95sq4f,26,2018-08-08,I [19F] am hopelessly in love with my boss [27M]. How do I navigate this?,76532throwaway_,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/95sq4f/i_19f_am_hopelessly_in_love_with_my_boss_27m_how/,"I've been working at this tech company as a software engineering intern for almost a year. The company is a small startup that my boss and his friend founded like three years ago when he was in grad school. There's probably about 15 of us total and we all work at the same location so I see him basically everyday.

Everything about the job is great. I love the community and the environment and my co-workers are all super nice. Just one thing, I've developed feelings for my boss. He's very attractive but what made me fall hard was his personality. We interact basically everyday and it gets increasingly difficult for me to act normally. Lately, I've been kind of awkward and I stutter a lot. I know he's single but I also know that he probably has never thought of me in a non-platonic way. So yes, it's unrequited. But oh my god am I so helplessly in love with this guy. I haven't had it this bad since I was in high school. He's actually everything I've ever wanted in a guy.

Our working relationship is very professional. No one has crossed any boundaries and I definitely won't try anything. He treats me really well and is super nice towards me which doesn't help my feelings either. We also always partner up for training exercises which also doesn't help. However, it's getting really hard for me to contain my feelings. What I mean by this is I probably stutter way too much, blush way too much, so even though I'm not yelling out confessions, it might be obvious I'm into him. I also have a bit of a flirtatious personality and that gets toned up when it's someone I like so god knows what he thinks of me already. I'm actually considering quitting at this point.

Any thoughts/advice on how to navigate this? Like should I quit/pursue it/switch into another position?

TL;DR: I've been working at a tech company as an intern for a year. I've crushed hard on my boss for the past year and it's getting worse. My feelings are probably unreciprocated. Thoughts on how I should navigate through this?"

Oh my GOOOOOOD buckle in people because this is a very exciting Gay story!!! If I wasn't such a useless lesbian I'd be less hyped but GET A LOAD OF THIS (tldr, construction intern/landscaping girl meet-cute)

I'm interning at a contracting/construction management company this summer, and our building is almost complete, so we've had a landscaping subcontractor on site for a while doing trees, bricks, paving, etc., and they have a GIRL on their crew. Seeing as it's a very male-dominated industry that requires a lot of intense physical labor, I don't see many other girls working on site so I was very excited-- not yet in a Gay way, just in a Girl way, like omg look at her yes I'm so proud of you YAY FEMALE SOLIDARITY!! I'd never gotten a chance to meet her, though, and had only seen her from a distance.

Cut to yesterday afternoon, and I'm doing my daily rounds checking in on a different subcontractor's progress. They're putting materials on a lift up the side of the building to get them to the roof, so there's a few guys down in the area where the landscapers are working. And whooooooo comes up to me but Landscaping Girl!!!! And I'm excited, yay new friend, but she's like:

(LG) ""hey, do you know the name of the guy in the bronze hardhat from \[subcontractor\] behind me, because he keeps talking to me but I don't know who he is""

(Me, willing to protect and defend her at all costs) ""oh god is that the guy who says if you get married as soon as you're done with school--""

(LG)""you'll never have to work a day in your life because your husband will do all the work?""

(Me) ""YES OMG HE TOLD ME THAT TOO! Yeah I know exactly who you're talking about, but I don't know his name""

Within, like ten seconds of talking to her, I realize WOW she's really pretty oh my GOD she's really strong from doing all the tree planting stuff and has really broad shoulders and is just slightly taller than me and she has this curly reddish brown hair that gets kinda frizzy from being outside (me too girl) and she has the CUTEST FRECKLES scattered all over the bridge of her nose and tops of her cheeks!!! And as I'm talking to her and slightly becoming obsessed with her, I'm thinking ""her freckles are so cute and I love them but I hope she wears sunscreen out here because that's a very important part of a skincare routine, but also if she doesn't then it probably makes her freckles pop like this so who cares about the sun??""

And we had a nice chat about how all the guys out here are weird, they'll talk to you about their wife and kids then ask if you want to go to the movies with them and show you the burner phone they have for their side chick. And I was like, not even thinking she'd take it seriously, but I go, ""you know what, WE should go to the movies! who needs them?!"" and she was like ""YES I love it good plan!"" with the biggest smile on her face. Not the kind where you're like ""yes Susan we should totally meet for coffee sometime, I haven't seen you in forever"" but like... real??!

So we keep talking and she was this super great soccer player in high school, got full rides to three colleges, then got injured the second to last game of the season and lost all of them :( but she likes plants so she is doing this over the summer to help pay for school, because she wants to open her own architecture company when she graduates

Of course, in a classic stereotypical lesbian move, the entire time my whole brain is flooded with the idea of this being the story of how we met and we fall in love and get married and become an industry power couple where she designs the buildings and I'll build them for her and we can have a cozy little house together with a big garden and I STILL DON'T EVEN KNOW HER NAME (at this point, I'd already written down her hard hat sticker number so I could find it out myself though)

But wait there's more, so we get back to talking about Construction Girls and her soccer stuff and how everyone out here expects all the girls to be super tough or whatever, but she's like ""oh heck no, I love a good pair of sweatpants, but when I want to I can get super glam"" and she pulls out her phone and shows me her prom pictures!! and her graduation pictures!! and they are SO PRETTY and I LOVE HER

So then she has to go back to work and I have to go back to work and I'm sad, but we shake hands like Adults and I start to walk away and she goes ""WAIT!"" and I turn around, thinking I'm about to walk into a hole or something, and she runs back up to me and goes ""what's your name?"" with the biggest smile on her face.

The whole rest of that day I was a gay mess, couldn't remember how to get to places in the building I've been going to every day for 12 weeks, couldn't remember what folder my documents go in, etc. and I'm wondering if she's planning our wedding too, because what else do the gays do in their free time? But I only have until the end of the week to get her to fall in love with me (or something of that sort) because that's when my internship ends.

CUT TO TODAY, AUGUST 8

Now I only have three days to figure something out. In a completely uncharacteristic move, I decide to not be a Useless Lesbian and maybe... do something about it. Before I go outside that afternoon, I write my name and number on a sticky note with a happy face, stick it underneath the papers on my clipboard, and resolve to give it to her if I happen to see her and she sees me. I won't force it, but if we run into each other, I'll at least do my part to move this along.

As soon as I walk into the area where they're doing the landscaping and material lifts to the roof, I see her out of the corner of my eye and I'm so nervous but she looks up from the tiny tree she's planting and calls to me and waves to me with the biggest smile on her face!!!! And I run over (casually, kinda?), trying really hard not to step on the plants, and she's like ""heyyyyyy what are YOU doing in this neck of the woods!"" and I'm like ""I came to check on my metal panel guys, and also see if I could run into you! What are youuuuu doing in this neck of the woods"" (...she is planting the woods, obviously. Hilarious.) Before I can chicken out, I whip out my sticky note and I'm like ""hey, if you ever need ANYTHING, I can't promise I'll be very good at helping but I sure can try,"" figuring that this both works if she's not interested romantically and is just looking for a Construction Girl Ally or if she's actually maybe interested.

**AND WHAT DOES SHE SAY TO ME?** ""Oh my gosh, I was actually going to ask you for your number, and you already made this and had it all ready!!"" If you can't tell, at this point I'm smiling like a maniac on drugs, maybe, and hoping she saves that sticky note so we can put a picture of it in our wedding slideshow. So yeah, I tell her ""yeah, you call me, text me anytime, maybe not fax because no one faxes anymore and also this isn't a fax number, so..."" and she goes ""Omg yes! Yeah I'll buzz you, for work or just like... **friend stuff**.""

**IT'S BEEN LESS THAN 24 HOURS AND WE HAVE TRANSCENDED THE COWORKER/COLLEAGUE PHASE INTO FRIENDS.**

So yeah, I'm very proud and so happy and sure, there's like a 0.05% chance we actually end up getting married or whatever, but it's lesbian tradition to imagine so it's totally fine! Also, I very much did step in a hole as I was walking away from that conversation and visibly trip. I'm hoping she either didn't see it, or at least it was an endearing ""I'm so gay that I was thinking about you and didn't see this hole in the ground"" trip.

And Sydney, if you're reading this, sorry for planning out our lives together without formally consulting you first-- how do you feel about cats? Shoot me a text and we can go to the movies, no construction guys involved :)"

Elementary School Social Isolation
------------------------------------------------------------------
For elementary school, my brother (~1 year younger, 2 grades apart) and I were sent to a ""theme school"" (exclusive like private school but doesn't cost you anything to go). My mom also worked there as a teacher. In the spirit of education, they did not take the kids to recess, or let us talk at lunch. It was lonely. We had plenty of homework and memorized poetry. Being ""smart"" was drilled into us. Certain kids got to be in the gifted program with special classes and special privaleges and even a fancy ceremony. I wanted to be in it so bad because it looked like fun. My brother and I both passed the academic test every time but the teachers there never gave us the recomendation needed to get in (Teachers there were kinda snooty so I suspect they just didn't like our mom and therefore disliked us)
 
We moved to a normal school when I was going to 5th grade and my brother 3rd. He had another opportunity and got into the gifted program. I didn't. However having regular recess was really nice.
 
Therapy Driving Further Wedge Between Me and My parents
------------------------------------------------------------------

6th grade was the roughest of my life. It was a relatively poor public school with kids who had lots of problems. I am on the younger end of my grade as well as one of the last to go through puberty. I was the smallest kid, already lacked some social skills, as well as maturity. I was bullied for it, my grades dropped and when I got home my parents would yell at me about it. Across the hall, the gifted kids had their own special classes with passionate teachers and field trips throughout the year. 
 
I didn't get bullied in math in 6th grade and got an A. My parents actually demanded I be put in the gifted math in 7th grade and I got to go to all the fieldtrips and got the top grade in the class. In the normal classes I just refused to speak and I wasnt bullied as much. I also got into programming.
 
8th grade I was put back with the general population. My grades dropped and the screaming with my parents got to the point where they just dragged me to the first of about 5 therapists. This particular one had the parent and child fill out paperwork. Mine asked questions like ""have you ever been pregnant?"" ""Done drugs?"" ""Felt violent urges?"". The whole thing made ~~13~~ (I fudged the timeline, I was 11) year old me feel like I was being accused. I was brought there because *I was the problem*. I knew I wasnt a bad kid but I felt like everyone thought I was. I resented my parents for that and decided the one opinion in this world that matters was my own (so I never listened to my parents from this point on).
 
Puberty and Me Giving Up on Academia
------------------------------------------------------------------

9th grade -12th I felt like shit. I finally started puberty while everyone else was almost done. I have always been and still am a skinny flatchested not really curvy girl. Acne made me think I was truly ugly and getting my period caused cramps so bad, it would leave me bedridden for half the day or sent home early from school because I was too sick. Plus they were irregular. The school nurse just told me to suck it up and I never explained it to my parents (or talked to them about anything) so they thought I was playing hookey when I refused to go to school but suddenly started feeling better at like 12pm. 

Our relationship really just got worse. My brother had been in the gifted program the whole time and had been getting straight A's so my parents would compare me to him. I got really good at programming by this point and owned websites with thousands of visitors a day but nobody ever gave me any encouragement. In fact my parents tried to limit my computer activities because they thought it was a distraction. It ended up with me locking them out and my dad yelling that he uses that computer to pay taxes.

Me Now
------------------------------------------------------------------
I ended up going to college despite my misgivings about acedemia. My grades were still good enough for me to get a scholarship and my parents saved up enough money for 2 full years and I would only get that money by going to college.
My relationship improved with my parents as soon as they gave up on me in ~11th-12th grade. They stopped telling me what to do and just give friendly advice.
I'm a CS major. I've gotten so good at it over the years, I've been able to get A's while showing up ~50% of the time and not buying the expensive text books. I've had great internships at Emory, A startup in atlanta and even Cartoon Network.
I got on birth control at age 18 or 19. I don't have to have periods with it so no more cramps and it also fixed my acne. I'm still skinny and flatchested but I have gotten more of a figure now and even grew taller while in college. I'm more confident. I've gotten plenty of complements from guys and found one guy who even likes my social quirks.
I still have a lot of pent up feelings from my childhood. I think it would have been much better if I had gotten to stay in the gifted program. I got a taste in 7th grade and I could have been a lot more of a well adjusted kid. I'm still trying to convince myself that I'm smart because **I think I'm smart**. It's a work in progress"
95tpue,1,2018-08-09,Frequent arguments between long distance girlfriend [20F] and I [20M] please help :( (Long-ish),thereclaim3r,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/95tpue/frequent_arguments_between_long_distance/,"Hey reddit,

This is my first textual post, so bear with me if it doesn't sound like it's supposed to :). Also, bear with my English as it's not the best. **Tl;dr** at the bottom.

Here's a little bit of backstory for you guys. I went abroad for university. We met in university and instantly hit it off and started dating. We became really close in a matter of a few months. We've always been advocators of the ""feel bad? tell me"" idea. It has always been great between us save for a few minute arguments which we got over easily. Both of us were happy with the way things are. At this point of time, we've been dating for almost a year.

However, I recently acquired a short internship abroad during the summer, and she got an internship where she stayed. There's a huge time difference so we can't really talk everyday as when I'm working, she would be sleeping. But we still make it an effort to text each other when we're both awake. She had most of her friends with her so she got along pretty much fine without me. But most of my friends were still abroad or were too far to meet, so I ended up missing her. A lot.

Recently, she met another guy, and got close with him in a one-two months. They started hanging out privately every once in a while and started texting/snapping frequently. I know all about the shpeel about how you aren't supposed to be possessive and tell your girlfriend to stop meet other guys because it makes you feel insecure. Therefore, I requested her to try not to spend excessive amounts of private time with the other guy. We had a few fights where we both left emotionally drained. But every time, she told me to just trust her, that she and he are just friends. I changed for her, and learnt to trust her more. We got past that.

Then, it was my problems. I am not the best at sugarcoating words, I admit that. And we were basically texting 90% of the time. Text is a great way of communication. But it usually does not show intention or meaning. Therefore, she'd get really triggered with the way I word my sentences. We both agreed that she should try to avoid misinterpretating my words and tell me when she gets triggered by them. And I promised that I would think more about my texts before I send them. We got off easy. I thought that was the end of our problems. Boy was I wrong

And then we got to another issue. I felt like I was the one doing all the work in this long distance relationship. I expected a Based on what I've read/heard, long distance couples have to put in the same high amount of effort to remain a couple, but she didn't. She wouldn't initiate conversations, ask me how work/life is going and wouldn't return emotions when I told her mine. Naturally, it sent out a few red flags. I then confronted her about it, asking why she isn't showing that much emotion, initiating conversations, etc. She apologized and promised me that she'd try to do that. I really thought the problem had been fixed However, after a few days of little change, she reverted back to who she once was, effectively breaking the promise. For me as a person, you don't have to necessarily change for me, i'm content if you actually show that you're trying. I confronted her about that again about that, feeling disappointed. She said, when she doesn't see me and when she is really occupied, she feels a little distant, and if we've drifted apart, it doesn't have to mean that she stops caring for me. She told me she couldn't change, not even for me and that I have to change my expectations of her(once again). I asked her why and she told me it's just who she is. We had a major argument over this and I'm at a lost right now.

We both feel really exhausted by the frequent arguments we're having.

I feel like I'm the only one in this relationship that has to change all the time, and it's getting pretty frustrating. Reddit, if you could share how you'd feel if you were in my shoes, it'd be great. Also, feel free to pm if you want more details or are willing to share advice/knock some sense into me for behaving the way I am.

I thank you for sticking with me for so long :)

**tl;dr** Long distance girlfriend and I argue too much because of our shortcomings, and it doesn't seem to be getting better."

95urca,9,2018-08-09,Got dumped by my gf because I'm not good enough for her parents,PobsORR37I,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/95urca/got_dumped_by_my_gf_because_im_not_good_enough/,"Gonna post here, since whining and receiving helpful advice helps me more than you can imagine :)

I will start with intense WTF since I still can't believe it happened. It's a long one, please bear with me.

Why I think I'm more than good enough: Even if I wasted few of my years running away from my screwed up family and figuring out what to do with my life I put it together. After my mom died 5y ago I was left without parents - my dad is an alcoholic and left when I was 7. I did get a job, started going to the college (paying for it myself) - finishing this year. I'm responsible, taking care of younger brother, have hobbies, maybe a bit introverted, but hey, everyone has their quirks, right?

What is a bit lame is that this year I've took some time, since last few years were too intense for me, while I'm still working on finishing college and getting a new job, I'm just taking slower pace. Also I did change company at which I'm trying to do work for my diploma. In my opinion that way right thing to do and I have good reasons (better chance of getting a better job).

Oh, and I'm not religious - have nothing against it, just not in the club (sorry if I offended anyone, wasn't my intention).

She lives in family with father working all the time and earning money for the family, her mom is housewife totally religious (several times a week in the church praying for..well..everything), managing stuff around the house - no job! Her 2 sisters are very very good students, ambitious, hard working. My ex is still doing well, however clearly not meeting her parent's standards (but in my opinion she's well above average), she's hard working, has many many interests, total sweetheart. And trying to please their parents..yeah..

So problem arose when she slept at my place. Her mom disapproved. I changed company for diploma - disapproved. Her mom wants her to get a job, finish college, get an internship and work around the house - and whatever she does she disapproves. And of course it seems in her mom's eyes I'm dragging her down. And that I'm not religious. And that if my family wasn't perfect I might have not gotten proper parenting and that most likely results in my being bad partner.

At the start she told me she needs to get away from her family and for some time she stood up for herself. I live in apartment with my brother so there's more than enough space for her to live here, however you can probably imagine it wouldn't be approved, right? After some time, her mom wanted to ""talk"" all the time about me (of course they wouldn't talk to me!) up to the point she became unsure about it all. We had plans to go to the seaside for one week and one day before that they had a ""talk"" again, next day she comes over, dumps me and says even if she loves me, we see each other twice a week and rest of the days she's getting all the crap from her family and she can't handle it any more.

Is it that I'm nuts for disagreeing with all that? We had amazing relationship up to the last second of it. All problems/disagreements were resolved very fast and we did our best for each other to feel as good as possible.

I'd really appreciate your thoughts on situation.

I'll end this rant with her mom's words: ""For parent, hardest thing to see is their child to die, next hardest thing is parent being unhappy because of their child"" - it gave me an aneurysm."

95wbi0,23,2018-08-09,**THROWBACK THURSDAY** Uno Lavoz vs Johnny Storm [Grind Time Then 2012],12Midknight,rapbattles,https://www.reddit.com/r/rapbattles/comments/95wbi0/throwback_thursday_uno_lavoz_vs_johnny_storm/,"[Link to Battle] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiSeKngdFOw)

""I said you know what rhymes with all the love in the world... and honey bunches of swirls... and giving hugs to squirrels?  How about the fact that Mad Illz used to be fucking yo girl?"" - Uno Lavoz

This battle wasn't the nail in the coffin for Grind Time, but rather the dirt being shoveled on top of the casket after it had been lowered and everyone already left.  If Grizzlemania 2 was the last gasp, this battle was the carcass defecating the lifeless organs to make space for the maggots.  This, before it was taken off of Grind Time's channel, was the last battle before Johnny vs Conceited's one-rounder that had any names in it on the once great league.  

Why isn't this on Grind Time's channel, you might ask.  Simply put Johnny Storm and Mad Illz made some kind of blood pact where Johnny had to do battles against Spider Murphy and Scotty Mazaratti on Grind Time Then until the end of time. Well, actually there's a little more to it.  Or less, depending on how seriously you took that joke.  Due to the battering Storm takes in this battle combined with some jokes Uno made about Storm, Illz, and Myverse (Johnny's wifey), Storm and Mad Illz did everything they could to hide this battle, though approaching 300K views is already a mission failure.  Mad Illz couldn't hide this in Smack's vault if he bought all the cigarillos and Henny in Honduras.  At one point, Mad Illz even changed Johnny Storm's name to ""juan"" (in lower case, yes) on the official video and when called out on it blamed a Grind Time Then ""intern"" for the ""mishap"".  A Grind Time Then intern being of course anyone who works for Grind Time for free, so we could be talking about Lush or Drect for all we know.

Johnny's return to Grind Time Then hinged on this battle being removed, and as he was the only big name left (and his proximity to living in the same state, Florida, as Mad Illz) Mad Illz gave him a battle with Conceited to appease him, as Uno did not want the battle taken down.  Of course the battle was only one round and trash...

Getting to the actual battle itself.  Johnny Storm shows up sick with a fever.  Not a great start.  It is also apparent throughout his rounds that he didn't take Uno seriously, which isn't all that surprising considering his deepest content consisted of ""Your mom is from Zimbabwe!"" and ""NIGGA YA MOOOOOOOM!""  On top of all of this, Grind Time Then had put all of its eggs in the basket that were Johnny's eyebrows and classically mediocre looks, and to have their backup backup QB limping around in such fashion was just a recipe for disaster.  

Johnny has an okay round one, but that's only because it's Johnny Storm and not some tryout kid.  His only shining moment in this battle is when he exposes Uno for being a real-life milkman.  Uno creates a rebuttal for this, claiming that he won't be lying if he claims he's ""in the streets moving that white!""  Uno couldn't, however, rebuttal the angle being used by almost every battler after for years to come.  Johnny doesn't even try in round three and after choking for basically the whole battle has to tap out, and you can see Uno's disbelief as he realizes that he's about to win the battle, because judged battles actually kind of still mattered back then.

Random tangent.  Troy Brown, Hollow Da Don, and Poison Pen are all here.  For some reason.

Uno has a scheme using the letter B alliteration in a blood/crip punch that's actually pretty decent.  He mixes jokes and bars and all that in a way that leaves audiences scratching their heads like ""Is this actually Uno Lavoz?""  Granted, he starts off the battle with the line, ""I said I'm gangster as shit!  I got them pow pow triggers!""  His set ups and writing are still lazy as hell, but nowhere near as awful as Charron, though he almost tries a few times.  Uno's second round is where this battle gets dicey.  Uno claims that Mad Illz used to fuck Myverse, Johnny's new girlfriend, and makes an entire fucking round about it.  ""The bitch named herself Myverse because she loves when rappers get in the box and spit on her like a hot sixteen!""  The highlight of the round is when Uno illustrates a threesome, no, sorry, a foresome... wait... a gangbang.  There we go.  Uno illustrates an imagined gangbang involving Lush One, Mad Illz, and Drect, where he has Lush and Drect pulling out while Mad Illz stays on Myverse, giving her what he dubs ""The Grind Time treatment"".  Probably one of the biggest reactions of the battle.  During this, Storm is frantically searching for his rhymes on his phone, which prompts a member of the audience to call out ""He's texting her right now!""

Round three Uno tries to get serious, which wouldn't hit so hard except Storm was losing so badly and just kept walking into everything Uno set up.  After the crowd ate everything he had said and knew Lavoz was taking the battle, it didn't matter what Uno did in the third.  He did his real talk shit, but he could have just pulled out a rubber mallet and licked it like Miley Cyrus for two minutes and still won.  ""But if you lose your stats drop and the best part about it that's also so mean, you're not gonna be Johnny Storm no more.  You're gonna become the nigga that lost to the nigga that lost to Scream.""  Scream was an ass Grind Time Then rapper boom now you know the reference.  Uno does a cringey double time and then ends with two ""Nigga ya moooom"" jokes before calling it.  

I picked this battle because over the years I've seen a lot of people on the sub who had never heard of this battle or couldn't find it.  Also I worked an eleven hour yesterday and didn't have time to do this last night, so while I was cleaning some dishes this morning I remembered this shitshow and thought ""Why not?""  Shout out to that Gully lookalike for posting this on SuperNova and the 9000+ views on this video.  It's a wonderful bit of history that we should never forget but never really love that much either.  It's like the one night stand of battles.  They tried to forget it but they could never erase it.  Happy Thursday, fuckers :)

You know, the ones that say you'll be a marketing associate, but really you're going door to door trying to sell something for another company. Since then I am always super suspicious about marketing listings and search the company before doing anything.

Anyway I thought maybe to help some other people not fall into their trap I could list the names of the ones I have found just in the past hour. Take a look at their websites, so hopefully you’ll learn what to look for when deciding to apply, go for an interview or accept a position.  

I am from the Philadelphia area, but here are some of those companies I’ve been seeing post a lot of openings:

Signature

Rock Steady Promotions

Myrmidon

Royal Solutions

Allegiant Connections

If you know of one of these firms please post their name in the comments lets weed these suckers out so young marketers can find actual marketing jobs."
95y3v3,9,2018-08-09,My father is asking me to lay out a career plan.,Mummelpuffin,aspergers,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/95y3v3/my_father_is_asking_me_to_lay_out_a_career_plan/,"I'm 22 years old.  I've been out of High School for four years.  I haven't been working since February.  I have no idea what to do with myself.  My father is finally expressing frustration.


It's become clear to him that I'm a bit apprehensive about being an IT guy for the rest of my life.  That sort of bothers him, because going with anything but IT is starting at square one and he clearly wants me to get going at this point.  I don't blame him.


I went to a technical high school and stuck with it's Info Tech shop, and have had multiple IT-related internships since then, so it isn't as if I'm unfamiliar with it.


Yet I'm really not sure I want to do it.  I feel far too stupid for the industry (Good god so many acronyms), I spend most of my time out of work on a PC so I really don't like the idea of spending most of my career on one, I mostly decided I was interested in it because I thought motherboards looked neat when I was little and I chose IT as a shop because I was worried about job prospects for people in Graphic Design and Drafting.  Now I realize that I also enjoyed machining / welding (probably the best option given there's actually a bunch of jobs in that field) and only didn't consider it because it was the ""dumping ground"" of the school where the kids who didn't care ended up.


It al led to this bizarre conversation where my father kept asking if there was something I'd want to do rather than IT.  I'm not entirely sure, and when pressed he finally expressed frustration with my lack of progress (which hinted that he was kind of pissed at me not going with IT), so I doubled down on going with IT with the rationalization that hell, it's a job, it isn't really about what I want at this point, which guilted him into again asking me if there's something I'd rather do, 'round and 'round for a while.


The problem is that like most people with ASD I'm absolutely horrible at imagining what my immediate future will be like.  I made the argument that I didn't need to make whatever I started doing my career, to which my dad expressed apprehension (It's easier to swap careers when you're young and don't have responsibilities.)  In any case I feel like I need to find a job I can support myself with, which in MA no ""unskilled"" job could possibly do.


I already tried college recently (software development) and that totally fell flat, I don't have the time management skills for it, especially when my classes were spread out throughout the week, plus a part-time job, plus a 45-minute long drive back and forth.


We're both frustrated, sort of lost and seemingly both want me out but I have no idea how the hell that's going to happen.  At this point I feel like a burden on my family but, at the same time, my father wants me to do something I enjoy as much as he seems dread me sticking around."
95y9nd,22,2018-08-09,Final Thoughts About Baruch from a graduating student,Monsteradi4,Baruch,https://www.reddit.com/r/Baruch/comments/95y9nd/final_thoughts_about_baruch_from_a_graduating/,"As I approach my final week at Baruch before graduating with a BBA in Accountancy, I'd like to talk about my experience as a student in Baruch.

Perhaps the best part about Baruch was the location and the price. At the heart of the city, Baruch has definitely delivered a valuable education for a very reasonable price. I believe that every NYC resident who doesn't want to incur massive amounts of debt attending undergraduate should apply to Baruch or any of the other CUNYs(depending on your intended major ofc).

Overall, Baruch might not have been the most sociable place in the world; however, there was a still a decent amount of student engagement going on: Clubs, fundraisers, networking events, etc. Making friends wasn't a daunting task since you mostly ended up being acquainted with your colleagues from class. Even though at times I might've felt lonely, I knew for a fact that I would be able to meet new people if I put myself out there a little more.

The most dreadful part of Baruch(perhaps all the CUNYs) were the departments: Financial Aid, Registrar, Bursar. Reaching out to them via phone was nearly impossible and some of the staff sitting at the office made me resent their services. Aside from pitiful student support, another shortcoming Baruch had were the classrooms. A lot of the rooms were small and very congested with desks that cannot even hold a 8.5x11 notebook without it hanging from one side. This mostly applied to communication studies classes since it happens to be a very popular minor-- even for Zicklin students. 

The biggest lesson I learned from attending Baruch is something that probably applies to every student who attends college: YOU WILL NOT BE HANDED AN INTERNSHIP OR A JOB. I had a preconceived notion that since I was an accounting student at a college with a very well renowned accounting program, I would have recruiters flocking to me to hand me internship and job opportunities. FALSE. You're going to have to rely on multiple websites such as STARR, Indeed, Craigslist, Handshake and many more along with some networking through corporate events or what not to get companies to give you interviews. Even though it seems that your colleagues have kickass internships, which would translate in your head to you being entitled to the same opportunity, that's WRONG. Those guys have worked their asses off to get where they are and weren't just handed a position at J.P Morgan or the BIG 4 because they were lucky. It's better to start bolstering your resume ASAP so by the time you're a junior, you're going to have opportunities to attain internships that are meaningful towards your major. If you already have internship experience as a freshman or a sophomore, splendid-- more power to you.

Last but not least, enjoy the ride... A lot of people seem to be in a rush to graduate but what they don't realize is that once they walk out of the door, it's over. You go straight into the real world: job, grad,med., &amp; law school, etc. Once you're there, I can guarantee that you'll be reminiscing about when you were a college student. You'll miss sitting on those chairs and listening to your professors ramble, you'll miss all the people that you met, you'll miss the fact that life was easier, you'll even miss the financial aid office if you're super nostalgic! 

If anyone has any questions or wants any feedback regarding Baruch, shoot me a PM.

Thank You and Goodbye

95ycwd,2,2018-08-09,My boss (40sF) pretty much just accused me (23F) of trying to steal. Coworker (20sF) may also have it out for me.,CCAJay,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/95ycwd/my_boss_40sf_pretty_much_just_accused_me_23f_of/,"I started working at my current job 5 months ago as an unpaid intern. One of my coworkers, who I will call Amanda, just started working here about a month ago. Amanda is a paid technician. I am a technician assistant intern, but will be going to school to become a technician starting this fall. 

Up until recently my professional relationship with my boss has been pleasant. I've enjoyed working with her and have come to really respect and admire her. Suddenly something changed. 

The business is a small private one and consists of 3 employees including me. All employees frequently enter the boss's office with and without her present, as we have to to do our job. I personally have been in her office many times and have had no problems until now. I even would sometimes lightly clean her office for her as a kindness, which she appreciated. Not once have I been told by anyone that she was concerned about me being in her office. 

This morning before the boss arrived at the business, I went into her office to look for some supplies that I needed. Amanda briefly came in too then left with me still in there. I left like 30 secs later. When the boss came in she pulled me aside and asked me what I was doing in her office this morning. I answered honestly, confused. The conversation ended and I went back to work. 

After thinking about what had happened I got pissed off. I have been here for months and all of the sudden I'm being treated with suspicion. It was also pretty painful to have someone I looked up to treat me like some kind of criminal. 

I'm not really that good at hiding my emotions, so I'm sure i was sulking a little. My boss noticed this and apologized, saying that she has had people steal from her in the past. I told her that I understood but was concerned about why this was suddenly happening now after I've been here this long. She was obviously trying to avoid answering that. Her apology didn't really do anything. 

I'm wondering if this has something to do with Amanda, and I'm curious about what she said to the boss to elicit this reaction. Amanda has been cold to me, borderline hostile, since she started working here. She's extremely snappy and does not act friendly towards me but she does towards others. Seriously this girl will run her mouth excitedly to seemingly anyone who will listen except for me. She's gotten really buddy buddy with the boss since she's been here. 

I tried to be friendly to her in the beginning and talk to her casually. We don't have to be best friends, but I was just expecting her to treat me with basic respect. Now I don't try and only talk to her when I have to. Our relationship is pretty much cold indifference.

I feel pretty awkward around the boss now and have decided not to go into her office anymore because I am afraid of being accused of something again. I'm disappointed because I wanted to apply for a job here but after this and Amanda I don't think I'm going to. I'm almost done with my internship, maybe have a couple of months to go. 

I used to love working here, but now I feel uncomfortable and like an outcast. I really can't  express how sad this makes me. 

Is there anything that I can/should do to make this better? Or should I just keep my head down until it's time to go? 

Tldr: boss asked me what I was doing in her office when she wasn't there, worried I was going to steal something. Suspect that coworker has some sort of grudge and may be trying to make me look bad.

So I’ve been bored at my internship the last few days. Summer is winding down and they’re running out of stuff for me to do, so I decided to put my newfound spreadsheet superpowers to use and steal [this](https://np.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/6xaxqy/the_road_to_1292_hrs/) idea from /r/baseball. 

Basically, the premise is that you find the highest scoring year for an 18, 19, 20-year-old etc and combine them into one “career.” Bonus points if you construct a narrative for the player. I thought it’d be fun to see the idea executed for basketball and waited for someone to co-opt the concept. After a year of waiting for my fellow shitposters to take the mantle, I realized the old adage rings true: If you want something done right, do it yourself.

Before we begin, I warn that this is gonna be kinda long. You also may or may not enjoy my writing—quite frankly I don’t give a shit. My family calls me an artist, my friends call me an artist in British accents (say it out loud to yourself and let me know when you figure it out). Without further adieu, I present to you “The Ballad of Mo Buckets: The Greatest Scorer in the History of the NBA.”

#The Ballad of Mo Buckets

**Prologue**

The day he entered this world, Mo knew he was born to do one thing: Get. Buckets. From his youngest days as a toddler, he would throw items into any open container if the opportunity presented itself. As the teen years came, while most of his classmates chased after girls to fill, Mo searched instead for more buckets. His parents lamented at their child's delusions of grandeur. His mother told him to find a nice girlfriend. His father told him to get off his ass and get a job. Both of them told him that he'd have no future continuing on the way he was. But Mo refused their advice, for he knew one incontrovertible fact, one that had been ingrained in him since birth: Men lie. Women lie. Buckets don't. When he was finally old enough to become his own man, Mo left home and caught the eye of an NBA scout, who landed him his first roster spot with the Los Angeles Lakers. What unfolded before our eyes was a career for the ages.

Mo was a skinny, frail thing when he entered the league at the ripe young age of 18. Not wanting to burden their young bucket-getter, Mo only played 15.5 minutes per game but saw burn in 71 games that season. He also quickly caught the eyes of fans, putting the “Rising Star” in the Sprite Slam Dunk Contest on All-Star Weekend. However, Mo was snubbed from the All-Rookie First Team, and this did not sit well with him at all.

The Lakers were also clearly disappointed by Mo’s inability to make the All-Rookie First Team and traded him that off-season to the Denver Nuggets. Mo increased his bucket-getting abilities three-fold, and for some reason was in the running for Rookie of the Year again. Although he had to settle for “only” an All-Rookie First Team spot and a playoff berth, Mo had already accomplished something nobody else had in NBA history: being named to both All-Rookie teams. Maybe Ben Simmons can join him on that list next year.

[Mo was traded again in the offseason](https://giphy.com/gifs/8UTulfiTpKUEM), this time to the Cleveland Cavaliers. However, whatever’s in the water in Ohio seemed to sit well with Mo, who came into camp with an extra 30 pounds of muscle on his frame from the previous year. That season, Mo became an electrifying breakout star, utilizing his new frame as he conquered the league. Mo was no longer getting buckets—he was *taking* them. He finished the season with his first All-Star appearance and was named to the All-NBA Second Team for the first time in his career.

All-NBA First Team

Mo upped the ante again the following year. Finally getting the opportunity to familiarize himself with his surroundings, Mo began to thrive in Cleveland. Every game felt like a veritable all-you-can-get buffet, and the only menu item was buckets. Mo once again earned All-Star distinctions, even going a step further and winning the All-Star Game’s MVP honors. Mo was starting to realize that his talent for getting didn’t have to stop at buckets, but could extend to hardware too. Following his being named to the All-NBA First Team, Mo declared that he wanted to remain in Cleveland until he could bring the city an NBA title.

Mo’s happiness in Cleveland was short-lived however. Mo overindulged one night at a party at owner Dan Gilbert's house and went to the bathroom. When he locked eyes with Gilbert’s gold-plated toilet, Mo just knew that was another bucket that he had to get. Mo was caught stumbling out the door with the lavish latrine in hand, and a scandal erupted in Cleveland. Gilbert immediately announced, through a strongly-worded letter written in Comic Sans, that Mo’s days in Cleveland were numbered. 

Mo was shipped out to San Francisco, which suited him just fine—with all the public urination there, he reasoned to himself that San Francisco was essentially the biggest bucket in the world. Inexplicably that offseason, Adam Silver also decided to abolish the 3-point line. Mo didn’t miss a beat—less points per bucket meant there were more buckets to be had. Mo would win his second consecutive All-Star Game MVP, his first Scoring Title, and led the Warriors all the way to the NBA Finals before losing to the Philadelphia 76ers.

Mo was again traded that offseason, and this time he called Chicago his home. At this point, Mo was used to changing scenery, and he decided that he no longer cared—buckets are buckets, no matter what stadium you’re in. Though Adam Silver announced that the 3-point line would be reinstated for the upcoming season, Mo was decidedly uninterested in this development. His discovery that shooting more two-pointers would, in fact, lead to more buckets became the most important revelation of his career. Mo would explode for his highest season average yet, leading the league in scoring and showing off his newfound love for two-pointers with another Dunk Contest win.

“Shooting Guard? More like **CAN’T** guard me!” After being traded back to the Warriors, who decided to go to Philadelphia on a franchise-wide study-abroad trip for two years to observe a third-world country firsthand, Mo made headlines by declaring that he would be playing Center that season, apparently tired of playing on the wing after the first seven years of his career. Sure enough, Mo turned up to training camp an astounding 100 pounds heavier than he’d weighed the year before, but somehow had put on that weight in entirely muscle. 

Mo’s declaration rang true that season, and for the next three, as he racked up a blistering 42.6 PPG average. He also absolutely demolished other big men on the boards, racking up an average of 24.9 RPG over that span, as Mo had discovered during that offseason move to Philadelphia that crashing the boards would increase his bucket-getting abilities. However, despite all his individual accomplishments, his team fell short yet again in the Finals, and pundits began scrutinizing Mo as a selfish player who would never lead a championship team, or even win an MVP.

A decade into his career, Mo returned to the City of Angels. Though the year was relatively pedestrian in terms of accolades, Mo once again led his team to the Finals, but was once again thwarted. The pressure and criticism continued to mount on our star, as he’d failed to even win an MVP to date in his career despite his overwhelming scoring success.

Mo finally won his first MVP, leading the 76ers to the best record in the East and silencing many of his critics, but he once again was eliminated before claiming the championship, this time in the ECF. Skip Bayless couldn’t contain his ecstasy and died from a hate-boner on-air.

Mo finally did it. In his 13th season in the NBA, he finally led the league in steals for the first time in his career. Oh, and he also led his team to the championship too. For some reason, the Lakers, Bulls and Warriors can’t seem to stop passing Mo around.

The three-point shot has been abolished for the last eight years, and nobody seems to care, least of all Mo. Furthermore, he decided that he had grown a bit bored of playing like a big man, so he took up point guard for the season. “Getting buckets for your teammates is second only to getting buckets for yourself,” Mo rationalized. 

Mo led his team back to the NBA Finals for the fourth time in five years, but lost *again*. In his most well-rounded season yet, showing a greater willingness to pass and defend, people began to doubt that Mo would ever truly ascend among the league’s pantheon of greats. At the end of the season, his Finals record was 1-4.

Tired of listening to the haters, Mo returned to Chicago and went on to rattle off one of the most impressive three-year runs in NBA history, winning the title and Finals MVP from the ages of 32-34 and bringing his NBA Finals record back to an even 4-4. Also noteworthy, he surpassed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for most points in an NBA career in his age-32 season—this is especially impressive, as to this point, the youngest person to reach 30,000 points scored was LeBron James at 33 years old. 

Mo also continued to show a remarkable improvement on defense, claiming three more All-NBA Defensive First Team selections. Mo had further decided that, after getting yourself or your teammates buckets, the most satisfying thing in basketball was denying your opponent the opportunity to get buckets.

After a contract dispute arose with management following his three-peat in Chicago (they refused to pay him by bucketloads for some reason), Mo brought his talents back to the Rockies.

The doubters of yesteryear remain silent…ahh who are we kidding, the nephews on /r/nba are calling him an inefficient chucker who had a few good years but is vastly overrated purely because he’s been playing too long.

Still not ready to retire, Mo decided to return to Utah again because the arches bore a curious resemblance to the hoops that forever danced in his dreams. Unfortunately, age began to show serious signs of affecting Mo’s play, and the writers and fans noticed; though he averaged over 20 ppg for the 21st straight season, Mo did not receive any awards for the first time in his career.

Mo returned to Los Angeles again, and ahead of his 23rd season, announced that he would be retiring. The outpouring of fan support was enormous, and despite his statistically dubious claim to the title, Mo was named an All-Star at 40. Then the Lakers won the championship, and in the post-series celebration, Mo said “fuck it let’s run it back, can’t end on a winning streak right?” 

Again he declared that he’d retire at the end of the next season, and again he was voted in as an All-Star, as NBA fans around the world sought to send off the legendary scorer into the sunset. The Lakers again made the Finals, but unfortunately lost this time. After the series, Mo said “fuck it let’s run it back, can’t end on a loss right?”

Tired of old Mo’s antics, the Lakers shipped him out to Charlotte, where Mo served purely in a mentoring capacity, finally sharing his extensive knowledge on how to get buckets with the new generation. Following the season, Charlotte gave him the option to return to Chicago, arguably his most-successful NBA pit-stop, and Mo agreed.

Magic was brewing that year in Chi-Town, and wanting to send off the NBA’s elder statesman with a ring, Mo’s teammates led the Bulls to one final championship to bring Mo’s career Finals record to a balanced 6-6 (as all things should be). Surely Mo would read the writing on the wall and take this graceful exit?

Psych. Cubes was never one to turn down a marketing opportunity and signed Mo that offseason as a way to increase the draw at Mavericks games. 5 games into the year, the Mavericks realized Mo was older than dirt and dumped his ass. Mo wanted to keep playing, but NBA teams finally made the message loud and clear: Mo could no longer get buckets.

---
**Epilogue:**

While the conclusion of this story seems a bit unceremonious, Mo became a first ballot Hall-of-Famer in his retirement. In his acceptance speech, Mo gave a 20-minute presentation on his favorite buckets throughout his career, and ended his speech lamenting that he’d never gotten a chance to play in Milwaukee. To many, Mo was a little crazy. To those who knew him, he was definitely crazy. To Mo? He was an underappreciated genius, the only person who understood the true meaning of this existence.

Hardy, I lean back in my chair and cackle while thumbing through the pages of my hardcover copy (which I should've had signed by folks there, but I wasn't thinking).

So, as I've already given a lengthy review, I thought I'd drop a legitimate morsel of knowledge in the book.  I consulted the Shadowcaster Discord, and the first item requested was Technoshamans.

And so, I will give you this.

**Technoshamans - The Streamer Must Awaken**

One of four currently available Resonance Streams, the Technoshaman holds a special place in my heart because, in the fluff, they scare the ever-loving fuck out of Clockwork - a runner who should've been merk'd ages ago, but is kept on in some twisted version of a freelancer's pet.  Or maybe one of the execs thinks he reminds them of themselves.  Either way, I hate the guy.  But I digress.

The Technoshaman's *raison d'etre* is interacting with creatures of the Resonance - Sprites, naturally, other Resonance critters, and even technocritters (which were also in the book but I didn't cover much of those).  As a result, the Technoshaman's benefit deals very closely with those Sprites:

* Their Compiling and Decompiling actions (all of them) are performed at 2 less Fading Value.

As I mentioned in my (shamelessly-plugged) [review](https://www.reddit.com/r/Shadowrun/comments/94wkfq/kill_code_a_review/), each Resonance Stream comes with a Daemon - a passive advantage bestowed upon the twitchy Resonance Streamer depending on which specialization they decided to take.  The Technoshaman's Daemon is one of the more complex ones, as it has a lot of ancillary benefit, but it can be summed up thus:

* A Technoshaman can summon a Great Form Sprite.

A specialized Complex Form becomes available for the Technoshaman to purchase once that Stream is chosen, which I will describe in specific detail once I get to that point, but I will also put it simply:

* A Technoshaman can make any Registered Sprite a Sprite Pet, which allows it to be active at the same time as any other Compiled Sprite, removes any limits on favors and tasks, and it does not count against the Technoshaman's limit on Registered Sprites.

---

**Great Form Sprites - Obey Your Digital Thirst**

What *is* a Great Form Sprite?  Simply put, it is a Sprite that will hit you with twice the Fade as normal for Compiling, but is capable of all nominal actions a Sprite of that classification can offer, with one notable change:

They *also* get a Great Form power, which will immediately void all surplus Tasks and will Decompile that Sprite automatically once the power is completed.  This is, of course, to minimize the sheer amount of abuse that I know you're already looking to inflict upon your put-upon GM's.

It's almost as if they *know* you.  I, for one, felt personally called out.

Digressing, again.  Great Form powers!

Each Great Form power has a supercharged benefit associated with the type of Sprite it is, which would make narrative sense since a Courier Sprite shouldn't be like Jason Statham in *The Transporter* (but how much fun would it be if it *was?!*).

I will throw in a *bonus* morsel in noting that there are two new Sprites that can be Compiled as of *Kill Code* - The Companion Sprite (Think Kevin Costner in *The Bodyguard*) and the Generalist Sprite (Think the intern that does all your work and gets you coffee-then again, you might *be* that intern, so congratulations!).

As they were added, they *also* get Great Form powers, but I'm just padding my word count right now, so I'll try to give a brief summary of each Sprite, Power, and effect.

---

**Great Form Powers - The Crunchy Kernels of Technobulshittery**

**Courier Sprite - Freenet**

The Newsies of the Matrix, the Courier Sprite in its supercharged form offers Freenet, which is the ""EXTRY EXTRY, READ ALL ABOUT IT!"" action.  Utilizing its power causes it to take a file it has a Mark on, open a tunnel to devices, personas, or hosts with a Firewall rating less than its Sleaze rating, and starts *blasting that file* to a number of locations equal to the Sprite's Rating every Initiative Pass.   As a result, it will accrue Overwatch Score equal to its own Sleaze rating every Combat *Turn*.

**The Crack Sprite - Gatekeeper**

I've already talked about this one in my review, but Gatekeeper turns you into Vince Clortho, Keymaster of Gozer, your Sprite is Dana Barrett, and your target (Device or Host) is the altar that makes New York your bitch.  If the Sprite's Sleaze meets or exceeds the Firewall rating of your target, you're considered to have four marks on it as long as the power is sustained - at the cost of the Sprite's Sleaze rating in Overwatch Score every Combat Turn.

**Data Sprite - Grep**

Grep Sprites sound hilarious, but I'll leave it to you salivating Matrix types to tell me if it's good or not.  Grep Sprites mesh processing power of a number of Devices (like how the Matrix is *supposed* to work idk) to boost Data Processing.  It *doubles* its Data Processing Attribute to complete the task, and increases that Attribute by 1 every Combat Turn it's sustained.  As a result, Overwatch Score *also* increases, by, you guessed it - it's Data Processing attribute every Combat Turn.  The kicker here is that it's the *modified* attribute - so it'll start at 2x your Sprite's Data Processing and go from there.

**Fault Sprite - Mangler**

This is the one that freaks out Hobgoblins.  Mangler Sprites need to succeed on a Cybercombat+Resonance[Attack] roll versus Intuition + Firewall opposed in order to activate this power.  The results, assuming success (and let's assume success because that's fun) come in three flavors:

* If the target is a technomancer, damage is Physical.

* If the target is a decker or Device, damage is Physical.

* If the target is a Host, the host is *knocked offline* if damage exceeds Host rating (and the Host will reboot in a number of hours equaling its Rating).  

**Machine Sprite - Overdrive**

Cyberadepts will know this one.  Overdrive requires a mark on the target device to work, but when it works - oh boy.  On activation, all the device's Ratings increase by 1.  Every Combat Turn the power is sustained, the Ratings increase by 1.  This keeps going until the power is deactivated or the device explodes.  Said device explodes when a bonus is equal to *triple* one of the device's default ratings.  Said explosion will be Matrix damage equal to the amount of the bonus you accrued.  So, uh, be careful around those rating 3 Wired Reflexes, yeah?

**Companion Sprite - Sacrifice**

Remember when I said that ""HEROES NEVER DIE"" nonsense?  That's this 'lil slugger.  A Sacrifice Sprite takes a Free Action to charge up with Resonance, then infuses the target with said energy.  What does said energy *do*?

* Immediately and completely heals your Matrix Condition Monitor (edit: Which, I'm told, is your Stun Track)

* Provides a bonus to all Matrix Attributes equal to half the Sprite's level, rounded up for a number of Combat Turns equal to the Sprite's Level (a +3 to everything for 6 turns?  *Shiiiiiiit*)

* Gives an invulnerability condition to you for the rest of that Combat Turn after the Sprite uses the power

Holy *crap*.  God mode, *plus* a bonus, *plus* full healing.  Okay, last one.

**Generalist Sprite - Coroutine**

Your intern goes external.  Your Coroutine can buff or nerf a specific task that you indicate.  If you buff it, the Sprite's Rating is applied as a bonus to your dicepool for your next Matrix Action.  If you nerf it, the target loses the Sprite's Rating in dicepool for the next Matrix action.  Simple, yet effective.

---

**In Closing**

I hope everyone has enjoyed this morsel on Technoshamans.  Until the PDF drops, I will delicately apply such herbs and spices of knowledge on the subreddit, unless a team of runners arrives at my door with a bag of money to make me stop.

Or they shoot me.  Either way, that probably won't happen.  *Bon appetit*."
961fuy,3,2018-08-09,Just lost my job today and I don't know what to do,CompteVidange,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/961fuy/just_lost_my_job_today_and_i_dont_know_what_to_do/,"Context: I'm a 21 yo man who graduated from college 3 months ago in IT. Despite having 0 experience besides a 3-month internship, I have 0 experience when it comes to working in the industry.

Soon after graduating (a month and a half ago), I recently got a job as a L1/helpdesk tech at a small company of \~15 people, and I felt like I was doing alright, albeit for a few mistakes here and there (which were politely pointed out). Despite not being perfect, I felt like I was doing okay, or at least enough to stay at the company for a while.

However, after a month and a half of working at this company, my manager recently called me along with the CFO, and they told four things:

\- ""You don't fit with the company: there's nothing wrong with you as a person, but overall, we don't think that you fit with the company and our customers, we're feeling like you're not what they want"".

\- ""You need too much training for the amount of work we have"" .

\- ""Albeit for these facts, I'm still willing to be a reference to you for your future jobs elsewhere"".

\- ""You don't need to try disassembling my criticism in order to figure it out, there's nothing beyond what I'm telling you"".

Now, these statements obviously sound like euphemisms for whatever real, more detailed reasons they had, so I asked them what were the ACTUAL reasons, but that's all that they were willing to tell me. 

I left without making a scene, but I had and still don't have any idea how to take this and what to do with it.

It took me about 20 applications before finding this job (good ol' ""you need a job in order to get experience, but you need experience in order to get a job""), and I basically have to start from scratch.

I don't even know if I should list the company as work experience, because having worked not even 2 months anywhere will look suspicious, and will probably end up being a dealbreaker leading to a refusal, even with the best comments from the previously-mentionned people.

This is probably not as bad as most cases where people lose their jobs since I'm only a young adult and don't have a family to feed, but I'm still devastated and have no idea about how the hell I'll be able to get another job with a stained work experience and resume."

962rrr,13,2018-08-09,Theory: Price Support and Self-Regulation by Feedback Loop,WhitePlateau,gridcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/gridcoin/comments/962rrr/theory_price_support_and_selfregulation_by/,"So, I basically found Gridcoin when one day I had the idea of ""what if instead of doing the digital equivalent of digging holes and filling them back in, a bitcoin-like protocol was used to do some kind of actually useful work?""  I did a search to see if something like that already existed and, well, here it is. 

But I have observed that Gridcoin seems to have a hard time gaining market share, and is currently more or less tied at the hip to Bitcoin and its volatility.  Additionally, without anything to buy Gridcoin is currently only earned by minting more, which puts it in a losing battle against inflation.  I would like to theorize a potential solution to these problems: devise a system by which people running a research project can send crunchers Gridcoin to prioritize their project in particular.  This solves the question of ""what can you buy with Gridcoin anyway?"", because you would be able to buy compute time.  It would also create a group of people, scientists with projects, who consistently have an incentive to buy Gridcoin and then spend it instead of selling it.  

It would also create a feedback loop between scientists and crunchers: when there is a surplus of crunchers the value of Gridcoin will fall and projects would get bid down, making it cheaper for scientists.  This would draw in scientists looking to buy cheap computing power, pushing the price back up.  When there is a surplus of scientists, the value of gridcoin would rise and projects would get bid up, making it more profitable for crunchers.  These opposing forces would (at least theoretically) make Gridcoin more stable than other coins similar to how the petrodollar loop stabilizes the US Dollar.  

Unfortunately I don't have the coding knowledge to actually create such a thing.  But I can theorize a possible implementation would be a type of wallet that is loaded with a number of coins, and instructed to send a specified number per verified credit/RAC to  the associated address of any CPID that works on a specified project until a specified time passes or the wallet runs out of funds, whichever comes first.  Of course, since that implementation doesn't check ownership of the project a side-effect is that anyone would be able to basically post a bounty on any project they would like to support.  I don't think that would necessarily be a problem though, since I doubt anyone would complain about someone throwing money at their science project. 

So, to achieve that I can see the following functions would be required:

1: Set up with a wallet.

2: Monitor a project to track verified RAC/CPIDs.

3: Determine the address associated with a CPID.

4: Automatically send a specified transaction when conditions are met.

Although not required, it would probably also be useful if there was some way for crunchers to see that a project has a bid on it and how much, so they can decide whether to give it priority. 

Of course, I suppose if someone was really determined they (or an intern) could probably do all that manually as-is.  Track a project over a period of time in a spreadsheet, cross-reference the CPIDs and addresses using Gridcoinstats or something, and at the end of the specified period send out all the payments.  But having a system to mostly automate it would make it an easier pitch to research teams, whose interns are probably already over-worked. 

Anyway, that's just a theory I suppose. "

I work at a company with other interns where I have built a strong bond with the entire group.  We have a strong love and caring for one another.

Unfortunately, this semester is ending and everyone (besides me - I'm doing another rotation) is going back to their respective university. 

This is the first time I've felt connected or loved by another group of people in quite a long time and I'm going to severely miss them - how do I deal with these feelings?

Thanks. :) "

Because I have the right to decide who touches my body. Because threatening someone for telling the truth to protect your reputation is wrong. Because women everywhere regardless of race or ethnicity; regardless of sexual preference; regardless of income; of weight; of clothes on their backs; or sexual appetite. Regardless of brains, or brauns, or beauty; No girl who has ever lived has deserved to be touched where and when she doesn’t wanna. I will only use one name because I believe the threats that have been thrown my way. But I intend to out ___. So that no one else gets hurt. Because I’m too tired to deal with the consequences of anyone else’s actions. You’re going to wonder why I’ve chosen to use this name. ___ didn’t rape me. He didn’t post the video of my rape online. But what he did effected my life more. ___ continuously violated me for two years. He used his leverage as my now-fiancé’s oldest friend to embarrass me out of saying much about it. It’s one thing to be taken advantage of by someone you barely know. It’s another thing entirely to be violated by someone you trust well enough and generally kind of like. Taking advantage of your body and taking advantage of your friendship are different kinds of betrayals. 

I’ll start with a few statements: At Auburn University, I was stalked, drugged and raped. A video was made of it and posted online. There it is. That’s the sentence. There was a network of girls and boys helping my ex boyfriend stalk me for the months leading up to my rape, and though I cannot identify the man who raped me, though his face is turned away from the camera while my mouth lolls and my bleeding face hangs off of my own bed, I have to believe that so many people being preoccupied with my whereabouts (the rampant rape culture at Auburn University, in other words) helped my rape happen. Because I was drugged and unconscious for the rape, I didn’t really find out about it until I watched the video myself a few years later.

It was about a month after this that I met ___ , a friend of my fiancé, P’s. This group he belonged to didn’t make a good impression at first. I overheard one of them call me a stupid sorority girl the first time he met me, and another asked if he could masturbate in front of me while P and I had sex the second time I visited his apartment. ___ was an awkward, but seemingly harmless guy. Everyone around him made it clear that he was still a virgin. I have to think that his awkward virginity afforded him liscence to do things other boys wouldn’t dare to like reaching into his friends’ bras. The first time he ever groped me was New Years 2014. A few of us had gone up to Nashville. We were packed into a taxi. I was sitting on P’s lap when I felt rough nails digging into my breast. I went cold. It was such a weird violation. Nothing like that had ever happened to me in public. I was too young and shy to speak up for myself then. I just froze. I couldn’t move. I may have said something along the lines of, “Um, excuse me.” He retracted his hand from inside my bra. I may have turned to P and asked if he’d seen it. He hadn’t. I asked another one of the girls if this was something he did often. It was. 

It wasn’t just the groping that was awkward. He used to have the hateful outbursts at me. I didn’t know this guy that well at this point. He was just my boyfriend’s friend, but sometimes I’d make an offhand comment and he’d scream at me in front of everyone. It happened often. Even on my birthday two years in a row. He actually ended my 22nd birthday doing it. It was so awkward that half the people just straight up left. But then other times he’d confess something really personal like we were close. He told me about his panic attacks and I gave him a few at home tips to help with them. But then he’d turn around and grope me wherever he could whenever no one was looking at every turn. I went cold and still every time. He was my boyfriend’s oldest friend. I didn’t want to make our relationship weird by making him make some dramatic decision between the two of us. I spent most of that year doing social acrobatics to stay away from him. 

When most of our mutual friends had graduated and moved away, we found ourselves in the odd position of being some of the oldest students on campus. I was taking a lap year and he was in grad school. This was a semester that I spent a lot of time at home not wanting to party with younger kids and too lazy to make new friends after school and work. I met his new roommate and really enjoyed his company. Around this more progressive and feminist roommate, ___ never groped me. I began to play video games over at their house. We hung out so much, I got the courage to kindly confront him about the groping. He became very emotional about it and apologized profusely. He didn’t seem to understand why he did it. It seemed compulsive to him. He opened up about his many panic attacks and started seeing a therapist. We began an unlikely friendship and hung out almost every day. A few of our friends wondered if it was going beyond friendship, but I was still pretty heartsick for P even though we broke up when he moved to Austin the year before. It was a regular topic of conversation between ___ and I. But there started to be a lot of talk in his friendgroup about whether I’d take his virginity or not. I felt awkward and pressured. It was a really bad feeling, but it was either hang with he and his roommate or make brand new friends a month before I moved to Austin for an internship. I chose the former, but I regret it.

He did it again. I didn’t say anything right away. But the next time we hung out I asked if he liked me, wondering if that had something to do with it. He said he’d never really thought about it because P and I had dated. But later sometime (and I don’t really remember why) he ended up kissing me. I remember honestly being kind of proud of him. I was his friend and I knew he had a hard time putting himself out there like that. But I remember telling my girlfriends I just didn’t see him that way. I told him that too and I told him I didn’t want to kiss again. My birthday was really close to all of this and one of his girl friend’s got too drunk and called me a slut in front of everyone. I talked to one of our mutual friends about why and he sort of spilled the beans about what ___ had been saying about our relationship behind my back.

I cut contact after that. There was nothing left to say really. 

It doesn’t stop there, though. It was quiet for a long time. I’d cut contact, but P hadn’t. We were apart of a group message with them that I didn’t post to much, but I stayed in it because it seemed important to P to stay in touch with them. One or two of them were in Austin by then too and we saw them occasionally. Last fall my ovarian tumors came back, and this time they took 60% of my ovaries with them. P and I were both heartbroken, and with my new and terrifyingly short timeline to get pregnant, he and I had a lot of decisions to make together. Two weeks after we found out, I was surprised to be confronted with talking about it with someone unexpected. P had told some of the people in that group message. I was exhausted, my abdomen was sore, and my hormones were absolutely everywhere. On top of it, I’d never been a fan of this particular person. They’d tried a few times to break P and I up the way caddy girls in college do. It was an affront to talk about it at all, but especially with this person I’d always kept at an arms length. I still didn’t know if the tumors were cancerous or not. I was trying my best to keep it off my mind. I was grappling with my own mortality in a very real way when I heard her say, “You’re so lucky. I don’t want kids. I wish we could switch ovaries.” I excused myself spent the rest of that party crying in the bathroom. It’s not evil to not want children, but it was tactless to confront someone with their own tragedy so casually. I tried to stay ahead of it after that. I told all of P’s friends in that group message just so I could be the one doing the telling this time. None of them reacted well. They all found a way to blame me or call me irresponsible for wanting to fight the illness taking my organs. The prospect of fertility treatments came up, and another one of them called me selfish for not wanting to adopt. Over the next two days he berated me over text message about my decisions and for feeling sorry for myself. 

Then ___ came in town to visit and after implying I was jealous of a new girl he liked, he told me people shouldn’t have children just because they have to. He implied that because I had made the decision to have kids by myself if P were to want to make another decision, I was trapping him into it. 

And then I lost it. I was done with all of it. I posted a list of all of my grievances against them and why I did not feel comfortable with them being around unless they apologized to their group message and left. Their only response was to threaten me with a lawsuit through my fiancé. A few days after the threat, my cat died under extremely mysterious circumstances. 

I’m not stupid enough to think a court would care about what happened to me years ago nor would I ever dream of calling attention to the video I worked so hard to get off those sites. But I can hold one of them accountable here. I can out this specific evil for what it is and help society understand how wrong what happened to me is. Because it was so normal. Because it took a long time for me to even understand how anxiety inducing and unhealthy my day to day life was with that guy haunting my steps. This is not just my story. It’s plenty of girls’. It’s his female friends who helped threaten me. I’ve spoken to people he went to high school with, it’s their friends’ stories too. It’s probably girls he’s meeting now. 

And it might be yours, if you’re reading this. And you might need to know that sexual abuse is never acceptable on any level. I’m a cautionary tale. Shy girls, speak up when it’s important. It’s great to be a wallflower. Just have some thorns."
964i1p,1,2018-08-10,WoW-Alliance/Europe/~30/Casually Hardcore,10n15,GamerPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/GamerPals/comments/964i1p/wowallianceeurope30casually_hardcore/,"# Hello, internet people!

To begin with - I'd like to emphasise I'm not advertising a guild or an organised community of players in any way. I am speaking on behalf of a few friends from different servers and few guilds. If you still feel this thread violates rules of this subreddit, please feel free to report it/delete it. No hard feelings.

Over the years, our little group of friends grew and shrank. Currently, we have more-less seven people, from which about four is online on daily basis. We went together through different games over the years, but we usually get back to World of Warcraft when new expansion comes out. We're not ""pro gamers"", never inspired to be and we're not impressed by them either. We want to do some content, have fun and relax after a long day.

Gaming for us is an equivalent of going down to the pub and having few cold ones after work with friends.

So, if we have few friends already, you may wonder, why bother going to GamerPals at all? 

It is extremely difficult to find like-minded people within the game. Random puggies care about the Mythic+ progression or item level and not friendliness of the group or becoming themselves a part of a community.

We were actively looking for people like us - friendly, mature, social-oriented, but still interested in the game - for years, with various (*usually poor*) effects.

Therefore, the decision to come here and try our luck.

# Details:

* We normally play between **7 and 10 PM ST** (server time, that is CEST), but you're likely to find someone around outside those hours too.
* **Use of Discord voice channel is mandatory.**
* We aim at casually progressing through Mythic+ Dungeons. If by chance, we'll get enough attendance, we might try 10 man raids, but it isn't a priority.
* We'll probably do some World Questing together as well, but considering limited time window we're working with, we might not waste whole evening playing Murder FedEx around Azeroth.
* We were never good at levelling characters together. It's a time-consuming process and everyone does it in their spare time. Doing some boosts is much more our speed, however.
* We enjoy occasional farming run through old content - for transmogs and achievements (personally, I don't care about those, but my friends do, so I'm on board).
* We're not PvP-oriented.
* We subscribe to the Casually Hardcore idea - that is, trying to do best we can with a limited time window. We're all adults with various real-life obligations and schedules which always take priority over the game. That doesn't mean we want to get better gear because ***""I have a real life, I can't play 12 hours a day!""*** \- we deserve the gear we can obtain ourselves. If we're not good enough to get it, we don't deserve it.
* We always operate under the assumption that better geared/skilled players pick up the slack for everyone else. This held us back in progressing through content, but we're more focused on hanging out with friends - even if they aren't pulling their whole weight - than getting a bunch of strangers who are doing their part but are assholes.
* **We're looking for up to 2-3 new friends. That's it.** This is not a mass recruitment endeavour - flooding the group with new players is directly opposite to what we want.
* Your experience in the game is meaningless. You might have picked the game off the shelf last week - doesn't matter. We're looking for friendly, easy-going and mature people interested in doing some group content. It's all about your personality, not your ""L33T skills"" - we can help you get the skills, but we won't change your personality.
* We discourage very experienced raiders from joining us - you'll get frustrated by slow speed and awkward attitude we have. We're not that type of orc.
* I'm hesitant to put a numerical age limit here. However keep in mind, we're all between the late 20s and mid-30s. And while I've met mature teens and toxic 40-somethings, if you're still in high school, you might find us extremely boring and not understanding your cool newspeak slang *(I didn't know what Snapchat is until 2 years ago when an intern taught me all about it. She also showed me Pokemon GO! I felt so hip!)*.
* We occasionally play Rocket League, Left 4 Dead 2, Vermintide 2 and other multiplayer, co-op games.
* Literally, everyone has a tanking or a healing character *(or both)*. We need your pew-pew *(or potentially heals, since most of us have a DPS character too. We're however saturated with tanks)*
* If it matters to you for some reason, the group is made up of two ladies and five lads.

I understand that getting into a small, tight-knit group of friends isn't easy, but keep in mind, there is very little pressure on you. If you want to sit quietly for a while and absorb the mentality of the group - be my guest!

Vedem si intelegem cu totii ca prioritatea lor este scaparea cu orice pret de justitie, de condamnari, tocmai prin schimbarea din temelii a legilor.


Se pricep sa minta, sa denatureze realitatea, sa construiasca discursuri populiste, sa vina cu promisiuni desarte, sa mimeze nepasarea, sa se prefaca ca nu vad, ca nu aud, ca nu stiu cat de contestati au ajuns.


Ce lipseste insa cu desafarsire este procesul constiintei, sa stii cand e momentul sa pleci, sa intelegi ca atunci cand esti hulit, injurat, dispretuit si discreditat de milioane de oameni, atunci ai pierdut tot. Mai ales cand minciunile tale au fost descoperite, cand adevaratele intentii au ajuns la lumina.


Cu nerusinare PSD-ul tine in fruntea tarii un condamnat penal definitiv, si cu inca o condamnare definitiva cu executare in prima instanta. Mai mult decat atat, Dragnea s-a inconjurat de prostovani, de analfabeti, de incompetenti si de slugi, ca sa ii poata manipula mai bine.


Deja a trecut momentul in care nu stiam si nu auzisem mai nimic despre Dancila sau despre alti mascarici din cabinet. Milioane de oameni le cer demisia pe față. Gafele incompetentilor au consecinte grave pe plan extern, diplomatic, si intern.


Deci ce nu inteleg ei? ceea ce in absolut orice tara democratica s-ar fi intamplat de mult. Demisii si retrageri in masă, disparitii pe veci din viata publica. Lipseste cultura, responsabilitatea.


Un prim pas il regasim in initiativa ""Fara penali in functii publice"". Pentru ca atat politicianul roman, cat si alegatorul roman nu au dezvoltata aceasta cultura a bunul simt, a corectitudinii si a responsabilitatii.


De aceea trebuie impus prin Constitutie faptul ca un condamnat penal pentru coruptie nu are ce sa caute intr-o functie publica. Ca sa nu mai ajungem unde suntem acum.


Suna penibil ca in 30 de ani de cand suntem ""liberi"", alegem sa fim condusi tocmai de cei condamnati la pedepse privative de libertate. Avem nevoie de o responsabilizare fortata a clasei politice romanesti."

&gt;I'm the new intern working at Mann Co. and well... there's nothing to do around here. Saxton Hale has been gone for a while, almost 3 years to give an estimate, so I would assume he either quit or is really working hard on his Mercenary Park project. Anyways, one of his workers came up to me and gave me this old project Saxton was working on for a while before he disappeared. It goes by the name of The Mannterface, and it intrigued me for some reason. The project was quite in disrepair, and I had nothing to do, so I've decided to fix it up and see how it goes. Let's see what happens....

&gt;Best Regards,

&gt;Antwan

Character aside, someone by the name of [iiNexxis](https://steamcommunity.com/id/The_Nexxis/) asked me to fix Mannterface, and I agreed to do so. Since the person behind Saxton Hale has stopped working on the HUD or being online for that matter, there will now be separate GitHub repository, Gamebanana Page, and a huds.tf page(maybe) for *plausible* future updates. Anyways, here are da links to find the fixed Mannterface!

I’m familiar with a lot of concepts for the CCNA. I don’t know wether or not to just get the A+ which i know i can do fairly quickly and land myself a help desk job, or just go for the CCNA. 

I’m 21 y/o and attended a vocational high-school studying computer networking. This was a netacad course for the CCNA. Everything was hands on with live equipment. Also, my first 2 years was A+ and network+ material. I don’t know if this would count as experience? I don’t have any of these certs because I was a lazy shit in high-school which i deeply regret.

I also had a 6 month internship with a networking company, didn’t do anything interesting here.

So I geuss my only concern is not having the experience to land myself the job i would want. I’m assuming even if i got one or the other, i would end up with the same level job. My thought was to maybe get my A+ quickly and start building more experience? 

Also, do you think there would be a pay difference in getting the A+ vs the CCNA (with no experience) thanks!"

I'm not too knowledgable on the staffing industry, but for someone who has internship experience at a fortune 500 tech company, I'm thinking I should stay away.

[Here is a picture of a spreadsheet where I have wrote my income and monthly expenses. ](https://i.imgur.com/4ICJI9Y.png)

As you can see, given this budget I should have £202 remaining at the end of each month, give or take (£402 once my student overdraft is payed off). I think it would be good to first build up an emergency fund, something around £2000 to £3000. Suppose I already have this emergency fund in place. Then would something like a Vanguard LifeStrategy fund be good for the £202/£402 per month for saving long-term? I've thought about HTB/LISA but I'm certain I won't be buying a house anytime within the next &gt;=5 years.

I suppose I should state what my goal is. I'm 21 and starting a PhD in September. This is the first time I'll be getting regular money that is not student finance or a summer internship. So I hope to start saving. There is nothing in particular that I would like to save for - as mentioned above, a house is out of the question for at least 5 (probably more) years. 

Thank you for any advice!"

Dad is still trying to control and criticize me.",cabsRmakingmepoor,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9678u9/i_33m_lived_with_my_parents_67m_62f_for_4_months/,"I, a [33M], went back to school in 2016-2017 and completed a technical diploma to change careers.  After a 1 month internship that didn't result in a job, I relocated for a new job in late 2017.   That was a terrible decision as housing was limited and expensive, the job's salary was mediocre and the boss managed by fear (he yelled a lot and they had a high turnover).  It lasted just 2 months.  After that I returned to my home city went to live with my parents.  At first it was good but soon we began to get on each others' nerves and what was supposed to be staying with them (in their spare bedroom) for 1-2 months max, extended to 4.   That was until February 2018.  I was actively looking for work, both in my parents/my home city and outside the state, even willing to go across the country.   I was getting phone and occasional in person interviews and finally landed an offer in Feb 2018.   It required relocating out of state to a job market with more opportunities than in my home state, plus gave me a chance to get away from my controlling and critical parents.  Besides, they were retired and deserved their space.  
I appreciate their help during that time but after living with them for 2 months, our relationship suffered due to their criticism and dad's controlling ways.  The final 2 months were difficult.  

While I've been enjoying my newfound freedom and challenges associated with relocating, finding a new place to live (been renting airbnb rooms since), I find that my dad still tries to control me, even from a distance.   He's often texting and emailing me stuff I'm not interested in, like about some social media platform or apps he wants me to try (I'm low key and don't have any social media presence).  For years he's tried to get me to join facebook and I've so far resisted except for creating an account under a nickname that I use sparingly for business purposes.  I just don't want my name associated with social media accounts, I just have linkedin and that's again after my dad pressured me for years.  He admits it's really just a site where you can show off how many connections you have , making you look popular.  Though I do see some benefits of connecting with recruiters when seeking work.  

Anyway now dad is pestering me to join whatsapp, he says our whole family is on it, says I'm the only who's not (I'm fine with it), now he says we can all share photos, emails, etc. on it - never used it, nor do I want to submit my phone number to that app so that they spam and harvest my contacts.  I'm fine with occasional emails and texts to the family, I don't feel the need to share my life with everyone all the time.   The other day my dad revealed his real reason for wanting me to join whatsapp.  He says there's a feature that confirms that I've read a message he's sent, so it would be his way to keep tabs on me.  I don't want any part of that.  It's just as annoying as people who request ""read receipts"" in email.  I always ignore that, but I do see the benefit for business correspondence.  

Bottom line:  I want to be in control of when I message my family and what I tell them.  Reducing contact was one of my goals of relocating for work - I want to be free of any obligations to my family and live by my own terms.  I hate how my dad keeps texting me when I'm really busy in my new job (12 hour shifts) and wants me to acknowledge his emails and texts.  He probably feels anxious that I might not have read it but that's his problem, not mine.  He just needs to relax and quit trying to control me from a distance.   How can I get him to leave me alone for a few weeks if that's what I prefer?  Next time I go back to their city I will rent an airbnb room and they think it's a ridiculous waste of money, that I'm always welcome in their home.  I don't want to sleep there again.  It sucks to pay $80 a night in a stranger's home, but if that's what I need when in town to gain control of my living arrangements while visiting them, so be it. 


**TL;DR** 
I, a [33M] lived with my critical and controlling parents [67M,62F] for 4 months when I was unemployed following a return to school in 2016-2017 and then subsequent job loss.   Now that I've moved out and relocated for work, I want to live my life on my own terms, not have to answer to my dad's pestering to get me to join social media and update him frequently on my life (I've semi grey rocked them).   How do I proceed on my terms?"

Until the middle of May I was stressed almost every day, and I tried to break up with him 2 times, but he was saying he likes to be with me and he will change this stupid behavior. So, in the second half of May and whole June, we were all the time together, like 24/7, and it was really amazing! 

However, we are originally from different countries, and we both knew that we will be separated after June. I wanted to break up and not go long-distance, because I don't really believe that it works out. I am possessive person, so I want my SO to be near me. And also, because of all the stress in the beginning of our relationship, I didn't see a point to continue, but I had decided for it to be like kind of a nice adventure for me. But we talked, and because in June he had said that he loved me and wants to continue to be in a relationship with me, we made plans how to make it work, how will we talk, when will we visit, that he will find an internship in my city from autumn and so on...

So, in July we went long distance, we talked every day, but because I missed him, I decided to visit him after two weeks. When I was at his place, he was at work, I browsed through his phone and I found messages with other girls, that he went out with 2-3 girls, even tried to kiss one, all this in March. In April he was making plans to go to the club with one girl. He had Tinder, which he deleted when I say it (sometime in May), but I downloaded it again and saw that he messaged one girl that he wants to see her after 20th of May. And at this time I was practically living with him! But because I saw all these things the third day I was there, I decided to act normal and just spend as much nice time with him as possible.

The last night I was there, I started asking the questions about wtf is all this. At first he said that it was only writing on tinder, just having fun with friends. Then I showed him the other messages, and he claimed that it was only chatting but he never met them in person, and this girl from the club was a friend. He even swore in his life. The next day before I went home, I told him that I saw that he also met them, and he didn't know what to say anymore. Of course all the time he was begging me to give him another chance because it was early in the relationship and that he had changed from then, that he started to get real feelings for me when we started to be more close, and then he stopped everything.

I broke up with him the moment I arrived home. However, he was still begging me to give him another chance because he changed and he feels sorry and what not. I was trying to ignore him, but at the same time I wanted to speak to him because I missed him, I was reminded of all the nice time we spent together, and at the same time I was sooooo angry that I wanted to talk to him just to tell him how big asshole he was.

After one week of the break up, he told me he knows he lost me so he wants to tell me the truth about what happened, so we talked, and by the end of the conversation he told me he didn't give up on the internship and he is still looking. But then I ignored him for 1 week, and I really started to get better... until this Monday, when he called me to say he has interview for the internship. And this fucked everything up, He was still begging me for another chance so I said if you come we can talk about this and maybe we will be together. Then I changed my mind, then I changed my mind again, until this morning when I wrote him a message to tell him to choose if he wants to be with me, and if he wanted he should stop talking to other girls like that. I told him to not reply right away to really think about it.... So I made the stupid mistake to again put the power in his hands... 

Now I feel like shit, and really I don't  know how to stop talking to him and move on! I feel like after 3 weeks he doesn't even want to be with me anymore, but I also feel like if he doesn't text me, I will, and I hate myself for that...

Sorry for the wall of text, I tried to shorten it as much as possible but still paint the picture of how it was. Thank you for everyone who will read it. &lt;3 Any kind words will help, I think (and I know that I am stupid and weak person, you don't have to point that out to me :D).

tl;dr: After I found out my boyfriend cheated on my early in the relationship, I broke up with him, but he kept begging for a second chance, and at the end I told him to decide if he wants to be with me"

In light of player feedback throughout the year of 2022 we have decided to implement and improve multiple new features in 2023

**Bug Fixes**

*We are aware of a bug in Guild Raid Season 17 where when players score points, the points are given to the other guild. We are sorry for the inconvenience this may have caused some of our players. A compensation of 1 imp key fragment will be sent to all participating players. Reminder: 20 imp key fragments can be combined into 1 imp key. We will be temporarily be closing Guild Raid for 3 months while our 1 software engineer who got his major in accounting attempts to fix this problem.

*We are aware of a bug when attempting to quest in which a full energy bar is read as empty and one gem is deducted from the player's account without a confirmation message.  This bug is not high on our list of priorities as we are too busy making the newest LE, Collab, Uprising, New Year, Year of the Muskrat Unit,details of who will be released in this post. As a temporary workaround we advise players to buy gems from the store in order to quest. 

*We are aware of bug in Colosseum and Arena in which the battle immediately crashes and the player with the most Limited Edition units automatically wins the battle. Though completely unintentional, we will allow this bug to remain as a feature for the indefinite future as the result of the battle does not change. 

*We are aware of a bug in the Survey Office in which when attempting to do any content in the survey office the units used will be permanently removed from your inventory. In order to compensate we will be releasing a new permanent gate, the Give Me All Your Money Summon. The contents of this gate is every unit in brave frontier, including fodder units. Even past collaboration units can be found in this gate, albeit the rates of which are 0%. In order to summon on this gate you must use a Give Me All Your Money Ticket which can be purchased only from our daily $50 bundle.

**Guild Raid**

Our 23rd attempt to run Guild Raid season 17 will be upcoming in 3 months. We have many new feature that will be implemented in this new season. 

*Because of complaints from the community of Guild Raid lasting too long and being too stressful to top players who have to stay up all night and take a day off from work we have decided to impliment a new feature to attempt to remedy this struggle. From now on, for the low price of 3 gems you are allowed to replenish 10 of your AP! Now if players want to sleep like a human being during the duration of guild raid they can spend a few gems to compensate the lost AP and time. 

*The bug that appeared in season 13 in which Bosses would not spawn has become a permanent feature of guild raid. We have found that doing bosses is too hard for a majority of our community after we buffed them so much that only the latest LE units with 87 Cost would be able to survive an attack after turn 3. Because of this we have decided that the number of points obtained from fighting on the boss tile will be scaled based on how much money is spent obtaining each unit in a player's squad multiplied by 1000.
 
*iUBB has been ""fixed""

**Community Interaction**

[Intern who gets paid 3 dollars below minimum wage, please insert some obligatory bullshit about how we want to listen to the community here].

In order to further implement this design philosophy we will now answer 1 question sent by the brave nexus project every half a year. This will be a notable expansion from last year in which the leaders of this project had to flip a coin 12 times, and if every result was a head then we would consider answering the question. The Brave nexus project will now have a shift in leadership, from the child that was kidnapped to run the project(He had enough bullshit) to NaviKing's pet raccoon. 

**Quality of Life changes**

We are still working on the QoL changes that were promised in the 2020 post. While we are working on that we will be introducing a new frog into the game. It will be the Omni King President Prime Minister Dictatorial Frog! These frogs instantly evolve a 7* unit into a max imped max SP Omni +5 version. They will be available in their $200 bundle along with 5 XP tokens.

9680zs,2,2018-08-10,Industry Vs Big 4 offers help,Jakes_snake,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/9680zs/industry_vs_big_4_offers_help/,"Hey all, I am in a little bit of a predicament. This summer I held an accounting internship with an Oil &amp; Gas company as well as attended two Big 4 SLP's. I just got my offer for the Oil &amp; Gas company for full time starting in a year and a half (after I finish my master's), as well as two internships from the Big 4 for this following summer.

The offer for the Oil &amp; Gas company was pretty lucrative and I thought going in it would only be a resume builder, but at this point I don't know what to do.

Some pros of the full time oil offer:
$62,500 starting salary with $2,500 yearly allowance, 13% 401k match, Stock options, ~10% bonus on average (although much less if oil is down). 
Basically total comp of around $83,000 to start with good chance to increase with raises

Some cons:
Title changes would take a lot of work, it's around 5-6 years before you become a senior at this firm it seems, I feel like it might pigeonhole me into the Oil &amp; Gas field for life and I'm unsure if that's my most sought after industry, Most people I work with are much older than me

Whereas Big 4 in my area (mcol) starts at around $55,000 with average benefits. I know that if I at least got to senior that my prospects probably would be about the same as the oil and gas company if I stick there. However, if I stick with it until manager I would almost for sure be making more than if I stuck with the oil and gas company. 

However, I'm more thinking about in 10-15 years when I feel like I may be limited to the amount of growth I can have because a lot of jobs have public experience required/big 4 preferred. For instance, it would be much harder to get a controller job or something along those lines.

What are your guys thoughts? Any advice is appreciated. "

Actuary work has always been a job interest of mine. I haven’t had an internship or really any experience yet. I was wondering if I’m way behind the eight ball if I started prep for exams right now &amp; passed them? Or is a job in the actuary field still a realistic goal? 
968pjf,128,2018-08-10,Subletter's boyfriend is basically living with us,archiethepigeon,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/968pjf/subletters_boyfriend_is_basically_living_with_us/,"I have two roommates, one of whom is gone for the summer (we are in college) so he sublet his room to one of his friends, Anna. My other roommate, Sydney, and I are still in town for the summer, but I'm mostly out of town for my internship. A little while ago, Syd told me that Anna's boyfriend was there a lot, even sometimes during the day when she was at work-- which seemed iffy but okay enough to me-- I mostly excused it since I was only there 1 night a week, give or take.

However this weekend, both Anna and Sydney are going out of town and my sister is coming up to visit for the weekend and will be staying over (a fact which I had run by both of my roommates months ago).

Anna's boyfriend was over yesterday, I presumed to help her pack for her flight, and then at around 7pm they both left (her to the airport). However, come five minutes later he re-enters and goes upstairs. He games for the rest of the night, door open, keeping me up. At one point, I heard him say to his friend ""you can come stay with us"".
I thought he'd leave today while I was at work, but he's still there, sleeping, according to Sydney. I don't even know this guy's name, because he's basically avoided interacting with me, yet he's living at my house full time, rent-free, basically. I was looking forward to having this weekend alone, but now there's some random dude there.

On top of it all, he makes messes and does not clean nor contribute to help clean.

How do I approach this to get him out without straining my relationship with Anna?

**TL:DR:** my temporary roommate's boyfriend is basically living with us, has a set of keys, and is staying and sleeping over even when she's not there.

Edit: I also want him to clean all of his dishes in the sink before leaving, but that may be a long shot "
9695y0,724,2018-08-10,"Starting college to study Game Design. Would like to sincerely thank Blizzard, especially the WoW Team.",ComboPriest,wow,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/9695y0/starting_college_to_study_game_design_would_like/," Long story ahead

It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say World of Warcraft has changed my life. My name's Colin O'Rourke and I basically grew up in Azeroth. I was born in 2000, so I am clearly too young to have played Classic myself, but both my parents played, and I wasn't too young to watch. Some of my earliest memories are of begging my parents to let me stay up so I could watch them run Zul'Gurub or Ahn'Qiraj. At one point, I even recreated the beginning portion of Zul'Gurub out of Legos. My parents recognized it immediately and described it as “scarily accurate.”

I started playing WoW myself during Wrath of the Lich King when I was 10 years old. I played a Draenei Mage (I played Mage because that’s what my dad played and Alliance for the same reason) on which I eventually managed to reach level 80. I loved running dungeons and being the WoW-obsessed kid I was, I was ‘inspired’ to design my own dungeon. Over a week or two, my free time in class went to designing this dungeon: drawing a map, deciding what groups of spiders would go where, planning mechanics for the bosses, mimicking Blizzard’s dungeon layouts to the best of my ability. 

I came home from school one day with this packet of papers for my dungeon, complete with cover letter, and tell my parents I want to send it to Blizzard. I'm pretty sure they stifled some laughter, but they looked through it, we found a large envelope, an address on the internet, and sent it off. Some months went by, and we mostly forgot about it. Until one day, I got out of class and my mom was sitting there excitedly, holding a large white envelope with the Blizzard logo emblazoned across the top. In a few of my college applications, I compared this to the Golden Ticket from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. That's what this letter was to me.

[This](https://imgur.com/a/eRKTx8K) was the letter. In short,

* They had shown my dungeon to the Game Designers

* The designers were impressed I had designed this as a kid

* One, so much so, they added a character named after [me](http://www.wowhead.com/npc=42782/colin-orourke) and one named after my raptor boss [Rek'Tor](http://www.wowhead.com/npc=20716/rektor) in Stormwind.

* They formally invited me to play the Cataclysm Beta

* And encouraged me to ""Keep Designing""

Probably all small gestures on Blizzard’s part, but it meant the world to me. And I took those words ""Keep designing"" to heart. I think right after that, I designed a small puzzle game and shared it with my class. It was about moving a spark through some wires without it passing under a bucket, and you solved it by connecting certain wires. Made photocopies, shared with class, and I remember having people lined up by my desk to check answers at some point. And from there, I only delved further into game design.

This also made me even more of a Blizzard fan than I already was. I still play WoW, and still love the game. I don’t think I’ve ever taken a break for more than an expansion.  Hearthstone is great, and I especially like designing [custom cards](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/8nnla8/war_for_the_outlands_136_card_custom_set_new/) for it as an exercise in Game Design. I have also attended Blizzcon, which was an amazing experience meeting and seeing the developers who I have immense respect for. I've designed and published my own board game, don't want to self promote, but you can PM me if you're curious. And soon I'll start college, majoring in Computer Science - Game Design. 

Perhaps I would have found this passion without the WoW team's response, but that letter really kickstarted my interest. I have it framed in my room, and occasionally reread it. WoW holds a special place in my heart, and the encouragement from it's devs really does inspire me to ""keep designing."" I hope to someday have an opportunity to work on WoW or a game which impacts people like WoW has impacted me. Certainly going for a Blizzard internship ASAP. I'm very excited to study Game Design, and owe a lot to the WoW team for their small gesture. Anyway, super excited for both BfA and Classic. My battle tag is StormWindBoy #1882 (I wonder why) if any of you want to play with me. 

Once again, big thanks to both the WoW community and it's developers, for just being wonderful. 
     
TL;DR: Grew up on WoW. 'Designed' a dungeon for the game, sent it to Blizzard. They responded, added a character named after me, and encouraged me to ""Keep Designing"". I did.

969d7r,1,2018-08-10,Just got diagnosed and starting physical therapy,SailorVenus23,vaginismus,https://www.reddit.com/r/vaginismus/comments/969d7r/just_got_diagnosed_and_starting_physical_therapy/,"I went in for a routine physical last Monday to renew my prescriptions. I had to see a nurse practitioner instead of my regular doctor because she was the only one available. I had a physical last year and they didn't make me do a pelvic exam, but this year they did. She put the speculum in, and it took my breath away it hurt so much. I've never seen a doctor look so concerned as I told her I felt like I was going to just rip in half. She finished the exam, and I broke down in the office; I told her I'd given up on having sex and that trying to use the Diva Cup brings me to tears. I'd never admitted any of this, and realized it had effected me a lot more than I knew. The shame and embarrassment came flooding out.

She made a referral for me at the university hospital, and I went in later that week. The specialist there was really nice and understanding. My biggest fear is getting a doctor that doesn't take me seriously, and since it's a teaching hospital, having a bunch of interns and residents come in to look at me, but neither of those happened. She gave me a referral to physical therapy, and I had my first appointment the day before yesterday. 

The physical therapist was also pretty nice, and diagnosed me with vaginismus. She gave me a dilator set and some instructions to do at home, and said if it didn't work, there are other things I can try. I was starting to feel better about it, but then found out that they didn't get enough cells collected during the pelvic exam, and had to go back in and get it redone. I had to ask them to use a smaller speculum this time, but it still hurt more than sex. Do exams ever get easier? 

I'm trying to be cautiously optimistic about the physical therapy, but in the back of my mind I'm scared that I'm hopeless. Does anyone have any advice for using dialators, or on the physical therapy process? Or even just living with the feelings of embarrassment that come with this? The exam today kind of set me back in coming to terms with it."

Heya! I have had a rather kinky idea that I've wanted to play out for a while. I was hoping you would play someone with a huge cock and you would evetually have all of the girls at Rooster Teeth as your pets! 

This could start out a few ways. You could be one of their cousins/nephews, you could be a new intern, you could be someone who's parent might invest a lot of money into RT, or you could come up with a new idea!

If you don't recognize the name Rooster Teeth, you may recognize some of the names of the girls: Barbara Dunkleman, Ashley Jenkins, Meg Turney, Mica Burton, Mariel Salcedo, Ellie Main, and more names that I don't feel like listing! We can start with just about anyone, depending on the scene. 

In case you couldn't tell, I am very submissive! My only real limits are toilet play, blood, and too much pain. But I have a ton of kinks! Rough sex, public teasing, clothed sex, discreet sex, impregnation, huge cocks, perverts, groping, and cheating are my main ones, but I am definitely open to more! And, of course, we don't have to do these kinks. 

I think that's all I actually have to say, so please make your title stand out so I can tell it apart? Add a color to it please. I can't wait to hear from all of you!"

And then, to add insult to injury, he sued his former girlfriend.

Now we have the Kotaku report of what happens inside the Riot company. Of course, Kotaku is a tabloid and what they write is often very unreliable. But then we had the official PR statement from Riot...... which pretty much demonstrated Kotaku this time was correct.

As for me, I have stopped playing this game when Swain got removed from the game and replaced with the anime version of Lucius Malfoy; and my decision was further confirmed when the next Void monster is the most generic hot anime girl who's very veeery clearly designed with the idea to sell alternate skins.

I see the reveal that there's a sexism and frat boys issue at Riot was forgotten two days later.

Are you guys really all ok with this?

96akbr,24,2018-08-10,It was a long time cumming,AllDayDPP,sexstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexstories/comments/96akbr/it_was_a_long_time_cumming/,"I met Allison right after college. We were both interns at a moderately-sized company, and frequently hung out during and after work. We got paid, but it wasn't much, so we spent a lot of time seeking out cheap happy hours after work. I never romantically pursued her, even though I would have if I knew she was interested. She was pretty, about 5'5 with green eyes with flecks of brown in them, and light brown hair just past her shoulders. She had a wide smile and a laugh that sometimes made me forget what I was saying. I guess I just valued the friendship we had too much, afraid to try something and have it all end badly. I was an idiot.


As we got older and moved on to jobs with better compensation, we kept in touch and became really close friends. We hung out all the time, even when she had a boyfriend or I had a girlfriend. None of it mattered, and our friendship endured. We guided each other through breakups with ice cream, or pizza, or beers, but nothing approaching romance ever happened.


Along the line she met Ryan. I heard about their first, second, third, and fourth dates, and she was smitten. I was really excited to meet him, and eventually she introduced us. He seemed like a good guy and we got along alright, but I learned afterward that he didn't like me. Maybe it was our inside jokes, or how I called her ""Ally"" when nobody else could do that, but she was up front with me about how Ryan was cold toward me, but she promised that it wouldn't get in the way of our friendship. She was wrong.


As the months that they dated wore on, I saw Ally less and less. We'd make plans and we'd have to break them, and it happened over and over before she'd make good on a promise to hang out, and then the cycle would began again. I was frustrated, but I thought that she'd figure out that he couldn't or shouldn't come between us. Eventually our decreasing contact became no contact. She'd dropped off the face of the Earth. I was sad, but I didn't dwell on it. I saw my other friends, dated on and off, I took a new job, and eventually had to move to London for a year to work on a project. 


It had been a year and a half since I even heard from Ally, and I had been in London for two months. I primarily hung out with co-workers, but it was a good group of people. One night I was ambling home from the pub and I got a message on Facebook.


""So, London huh?"" It was Ally, and I stopped in my tracks on the sidewalk. I'd had a few beers, and I fired off a response that sober me probably would have stopped.


""You didn't know? All my friends did."" As I was pushing my phone back into my pocket, I felt good about myself in my Guiness-induced haze. I walked a few blocks before my phone buzzed again. 


""I deserve that."" Angry and agreeing, I didn't respond. I got home and went up to my apartment. As I stuck my key in the door, she wrote again. ""I'm so sorry. You deserved better.""


""You're right,"" I wrote back. I got ready for bed and fell asleep quickly. When I woke up in the morning, I immediately thought of the messages hours before and reached for my phone. I knew I'd been a dick, but I probably should have been. I wondered if she'd said anything else. I unlocked my phone and went to the messages.


""What if I told you I was coming to London on Friday and wanted to see you?"" I choked on my own spit. It was 6am in London and 1am on the east coast. 


""I'd give you the address to my apartment here and be excited to see you,"" I replied, no longer drunk. I figured she'd still be asleep.


""Well, I'm waiting :)"" she replied right away. I sent her my address, and for the next hour it was like it always was. She apologized over and over for disappearing, asked me how my life was, and we made fun of each other as usual. I didn't ask about Ryan because I didn't care. She didn't mention him, and around 2am her time she went to sleep. 


The next two days were quiet. I didn't know why she was coming to London, or even whether Ryan was coming with her. On Friday night as she boarded her red-eye flight, I heard from her.


""Boarding now,"" she wrote, ""see you soon!"" I went to bed knowing that I'd see her early the next morning. When I woke up I called out of work ""sick,"" and waited for her to arrive. She messaged to say she'd landed, and finally showed up, knocking at my door. When I opened the door, she dropped her bag in the hall and lunged at me with a hug, knocking me to the floor on my back with her on top of me.


""Hi,"" she said simply, flashing her wide grin, ""I missed you, Moose."" Moose became my nickname shortly after we met when she misheard my last name. 


""I missed you too, Ally."" We got back to our feet and I brought her bag in from the hall. I gave her a quick tour of my apartment that ended at my balcony, where I left her to open a bottle of white wine and pour two glasses which I brought outside. ""Okay, I'm willing to put the last year and a half behind us, but I need to know,"" I started, ""what are you doing here?"" She stared into her glass for a few moments, before looking into my eyes, with tears welling up in hers.


""I broke up with Ryan a few months ago. He was trying to control every part of my life and I finally couldn't take it anymore.""


""I'm sorry, Ally,"" I interrupted, not realizing there was more.


""I spent the last couple of months trying to figure things out, not knowing what I wanted. And then about a week ago I realized it was you."" I'm sure I formed my mouth to say words, but nothing came out. We just stared at each other in silence for ten seconds worth of eternity, until finally I took some damn initiative. I set my glass of wine down on the little table I had out there and squatted to pick her up. She squealed and wrapped her legs around my waist, and kissed me as she wrapped her arms around my shoulders, spilling her wine down my back in the process. I arched my back as the cold drink soaked my shirt. She made wide eyes and started to apologize through a little chuckle.


""It's okay, I don't care,"" I grunted, and then we kissed again as I carried her inside, through my apartment and to my bedroom. I went right to the bed and fell with her onto it, landing on top of her.


""Oh, we kiss once and you think I'll just fuck you?"" she joked, placing a hand on my face and kissing me firmly. She started tugging at my wine-soaked shirt with her other hand. I sat up on my knees and pulled it over my head before dropping it onto the floor. As I did that, she scooted to the center of the bed, so I crawled back onto her and kissed her deeply. I pinned her hands above her head, my fingers intertwined with hers, and we just kept making out through heavy breaths and subtle moans of pleasure. I couldn't tell you how long we kissed, but I reached a point where my cock was achingly hard, and I really wanted to move things along. I sat up on my knees again, pulling her up to a seated position, and I pulled off her shirt with both hands. She must have got the message, because she took off her bra and fell back onto the bed. Her C cup tits swayed as she landed, and I rushed to taste them. With one hand I grabbed her left tit and started sucking on the nipple, alternating between sucking it gently between my lips and just flicking it with my tongue. I then moved to the right, enveloping her flesh with my mouth. She was moaning, and she placed both of her hands on my back, pressing her fingertips into my shoulder blades harder and harder. I sat up again and unbuttoned her jeans, pulling them down along with her underwear to just below her knees before I climbed back onto her. ""You're not gonna take them all the way off?"" she taunted.


""Not yet,"" I said simply, as I eased two fingers inside her soaking pussy. She bit her lip and moaned softly, and those moans grew louder as I started to finger her. Her pants being by her knees limited her movement, but she writhed beneath me as I drove my fingers inside her over and over, curling them upwards as they moved. 


""Mmm, I'm gonna cum,"" she whimpered, gripping her own hair with both hands. It wasn't long before she came, holding her breath for a moment as her body tensed, and then letting it out as she trembled. I kept fingering her, and she squealed, pushing my hand out of her pussy. I hurriedly got up and took off my pants and boxers, revealing my stiff cock to Ally, who stared at it with raised eyebrows. I'm not huge -- a shade over 7"" with probably above average girth, but it was clear that Ally approved.


""We'd better take these off too,"" I said, finally pulling her pants off the rest of the way. ""I'll get a condom,"" I said, moving towards the nightstand. Ally grabbed me by the wrist and pulled me back toward her.


""Or..."" she trailed off, taking my cock gently into her hand and stroking it softly. 


""Are you sure?"" I asked, acknowledging the unspoken suggestion. She nodded with a smile and pulled me on top of her. I took my throbbing cock and slipped it into her hot, tight pussy. 


""Mmm, Moose,"" she cooed into my ear as I started to fuck her with slow, deep strokes. She wrapped her legs around my waist and I squeezed a hand between our bodies to rub her clit as I pushed deep inside her dripping wet hole. I wanted to make her cum again, but I just couldn't last that long. She felt so good and all the emotion involved had me close to my own orgasm much earlier than I wanted.


""Oh fuck, Ally, I'm gonna cum,"" I grunted, as my throbbing cock was moments from filling her with hot jizz.


""Let me suck it out of you,"" she asked. I pulled out and rolled onto my back. She got on all fours at my side, took my shaft in her hands and furiously stroked it while she sucked on the head. I lasted just seconds before I filled her mouth with cum. She kept stroking me like she was trying to squeeze every drop out of me, and it was simultaneously agonizing and amazing, with my twitching, sensitive dick unable to handle it. She finally let me fall from her mouth and swallowed my load with a devilish grin. I was breathless, and she laid down next to me. ""Um... how long before you can go again?"""
96avkz,2,2018-08-10,21M4F - Seducing the Celeb,Renegade1997,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/96avkz/21m4f_seducing_the_celeb/,"When I signed up for the internship to help out on your movie set, the potential of meeting you was pretty much just a pipedream for me. Maybe I'd say a few words to you every now and then, have a pleasant conversation, maybe even get a picture at the end, but I mostly did it to help out the potential of working in movies later on in life.

As part of my compensation for the internship, I was invited to the movie premiere. I got myself a new suit, dressed up and walked along with everyone else that was involved in the movie, getting a taste for this life and wanting more.

It was at this premiere where I saw you again, like I usually did, except this time you were alone, and you looked stunning. You were seated at the bar, having a drink, and I figured now would probably be my last chance to say something. So, I downed the rest of my drink and walked over to you.

---

Hey! I'm Matthew, 21 years old and I'm looking for a girl to play as a celeb on this big movie premier. Ideally the two of us flirt for a little bit before sneaking off for some alone time. This can be as vanilla or as kinky as you desire, either way is perfectly fine with me.

Favorite Celebs: Emma Watson, Emma Roberts, Scarlett Johannson, Ariana Grande, Victoria Justice, Jennifer Lawrence, Alexa Bliss, Becky Lynch, Dakota Kai, Nadine Velasquez, Aubrey Plaza

I hope to hear back from some of y'all, and if you want to play one of my previous prompts I'm always open to those as well!"

(On mobile and not my first language, sorry)

A little background :

I am an IT helpdesk supervisor in a big company and since we are a stock market registered company, we have audits on all facet of our work, from giving or deleting access, to ordering stuff like PC monitors and Laptop.

It happened a couple of times that the head of auditors call me and request, in a impolite way, to find a ticket to justify why one of my tech made a change in a employee account or the ticket to justify a employee with a tablet or stuff like that, saying that everything have to be requested and approuved.

I am sure you can sense where this is going... 

So this morning I see a ticket to deliver a PC to a new auditor that will start monday. I ask a very reliable intern in the team to deliver the PC.

An hour later, the intern comes back with the PC saying that the head of auditors want a Laptop for his employee instead and he told hin that he made a simple mistake and that he talked to another tech ""and it's ok"".

One thing you need to know is that for a PC, we don't need to buy anything, but for a Laptop, it needs to be be approved by the buyer and it will be check for sure.

So I pick up the phone and, here's the petty revenge, I told the head of audit: ""Sorry, we can only deliver the pc for now. If you made a mistake, you need to make a new request for a laptop and, for internal audit reason, everything have to be requested and approved"". 

His silence made my week."

I got this job after an internship and I realized I won a lottery - since then I've been giving my 200% to succeed. 

And things are going well, I just got promoted, also assigned a team lead role - I love it. I love my job and my career and I want to focus my 20s on it.

Now, I met my SO a year ago and we were fairly good friends but eventually started dating. I really like her - she's nice, fun, cute and I like her company.  I told her about my work schedule in the beginning of my relationship, I explained her that I often work long hours and there are weeks/months where I push myself really hard, and that at the end of the day the work is a big part of my life and I'm not changing that. She said it's fine, but it obviously isn't.

Thing is, I often find myself juggling between staying to work and going out with her. We see each other 2, 3 or 4 times per week, and she wants more but I can't give it to her. All of our datenights last for 4+ hours, and I honestly can't squeeze any more of these in my week. I tried a month ago, but I was so tired after couple of days so I just gave up.

This fight started 2 months ago. It cooled down a bit but it's here again. We're fighting about this for weeks now and there's no ending.

While I really like her, I just think she'd be better off without me, I mean with someone who's prepared to commit more time to her - which I am not. I can keep on telling her that I'll try to work on this but the truth is that I won't, but then again I like her A LOT. 

This is a really hard decision for me and if anyone has any input I would really appreciate it...

\*\*tl;dr:\*\* together with my girlfriend for 7 years. I work long hours and don't have a lot of time for datenights. She expects more time spent together but I can't give that to her. I'm tempted to break things off for her sake, I just don't see how can I make her happy without changing this, but I don't know if I'm going to regret it..."
96cb1e,7,2018-08-10,I...deserve a break?,gfuds,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/96cb1e/ideserve_a_break/,"When I was turning in my textbooks for my summer classes (got A's in both of them woot woot!), the cashier told me to ""Enjoy your week off. You deserve it!"" Every time I would have some sort of vacation and went home (summer, Christmas, etc) my nparents would be forcing me to do something. When I was physically and mentally exhausted, they would be telling me to find a job, go to an internship, do something. Even if I wanted to rest for just a couple weeks, that pressure was always ALWAYS there. I always felt like there was something terribly wrong that would come up so I would always be stressed. My nparents would scream at me if I had forgotten to do something or hadn't done something that was due in 3-5 months. I realized today that I really have never had a true break for a very long time. This overwhelming stress and anxiety that permeates my being during breaks prevents me from really relaxing or enjoying them. My motivation to do that stuff was not out of a drive for myself. It was out of pure fear of my nparents' reaction.

This week, I'm going to try to enjoy my break. I'd like some advice from you guys on how to do that. Have you had similar experiences? Do you/have you felt the same way?"

For the past six months, O’malley’s had become something of a lone source of comfort for Elise. The same dingy booth in the back corner awaited Elise with each passing week, and each time she found the seat more inviting, another drink more tempting. Though no matter how times she had drunk herself into a stupor, she never wished for anyone else’s company, only left to remain in her own sorrows.

Though sometimes, a certain woman would come to the forefront of her mind…

Elise worked as a secretary for a law firm. The pay had been enough to keep the threat of homelessness at bay, but that hardly mattered to Elise when she worked. No, her boss, the woman she daydreamed about as a schoolgirl might, occupied her thoughts. The girl could hardly function properly around the woman, her eyes averted to anywhere else in the room when they rarely spoke, her sentences stuttered and short when she spoke.

The woman exuded personal confidence and strength, traits Elise admired and so desperately wished she had. Struggling in the trials of the real world, the young redhead had been drawn to her like a moth to a flame. Her own lack of friends or self esteem for once did not matter when she caught her boss’s gaze. Elise’s fears and self doubts seemingly disappeared when she was around the woman. Her knees seemed to weaken, too.

Elise found herself daydreaming once more, dreaming of being led by the hand by her boss, of being taken care of, of serving… The creak of the door brought Elise back to the real world she so desperately disliked, and she noticed a familiar face…

( Hello! Thanks for reading all that. This is a story I’d like to craft about my character named Elise, a young, vulnerable, and sensitive girl not ready for the real world. She finds comfort and security in her boss, a rare moment in her stressful life. I can imagine this story going many ways, not set in stone. Does her boss manipulate and take advantage of her young intern? Or does she find love as well? Regardless, this should be a story of gentle domination, and care. This’ll incorporate elements of D / S and MD / LG. Sound like your cup of tea? Please. Send me a message and I’d love to try something out!)"
96cpna,17,2018-08-10,"It took 3 years, but I finally have my pilot. Not sure how to proceed.",RoadkillRangers,animationcareer,https://www.reddit.com/r/animationcareer/comments/96cpna/it_took_3_years_but_i_finally_have_my_pilot_not/,"A little background. I earned my computer animation degree in 2007, and immediately got an internship doing some special effects for a theatrical movie (The Alphabet Killer). After that, though, I decided animation wasn't for me. I much preferred WATCHING cartoons than making them... so I went back to school and a few years later got my BFA in graphic design (which is what my profession has been ever since).

In 2015, I was out of a job and decided to use the free time to pursue a dream of mine: writing a cartoon. So I did. A few months and many rewrites later, it was done. I sent the script around just to get a general consensus, and people liked it! One of my old animation professors said he thought he knew how we could actually do this, and that's when things started getting real. I got some voice actors (friends and friends of friends), and recorded the lines in 2016. I single handedly drew and colored 200+ backgrounds. I did the storyboards. I did the animatic. I got the copyright... things were coming together.

I was promised interns, but that didn't happen, so between 2017 and 2018, I animated everything by myself. These last few months were spent sound mixing, adding sound effects, and lastly music. So yeah- 3 years in the making for a 15 min cartoon. (I drew everything in Illustrator on a tablet, colored everything in Photoshop, and then animated everything in AfterEffects).

I guess what I'm asking is, if I wanted to try to get this into the hands of someone who could possibly get this into a series on adult swim, Cartoon Network, Netflix, etc... what would be my best approach?

96ehh1,6,2018-08-11,Recent graduate: being broke in money or in growth,millenialcoach,Unemployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unemployed/comments/96ehh1/recent_graduate_being_broke_in_money_or_in_growth/,"I am a recent graduate and have been at the job search for 2 months now. I've applied to over 80 jobs, sent cold emails (never again), have applied both locally and all over the states. I now realize my degrees in social science &amp; vague design major is not particularly useful or practical... But I have had some solid experience as a recent graduate, as I have worked for an organization where I conducted project management/team management completely remotely for two years as well as having interned at the U.S. Embassy. 

I went to a locally established recruiting agency this week and after looking at my resume, they recommended I take an administrative assistant position to get my foot in the door as the job market is small here and I would not be able to get hired with the lack of experience. But the fact that I worked four years for my degrees and gained intern/work experience to be an administrative assistant makes me feel as if I am back tracking. l am afraid it will not be a foot in the door at all as I will not be gaining practical skills for my future jobs and am afraid it will be hard to break out of the ""administrative role"" career path to pursue my own interests. But the recruiting agency I talked to made it sound like with the niche job market here, that is what would be the most realistic for me. 

I see other people who have taken internships in a relevant field, then gotten hired as a full time employee. I see that as the best route. But a lot of solid internships I would like are out of state in a bigger city (DC and New York) and I do not know if I could afford to live in a big city (high living costs) on an intern's salary. 

So here is my question: my biggest goal is to pay off my loans ASAP and land a job with upward mobility and learning. 

I feel as if living in my home state, I could pay off my loans faster (lower cost of living, higher wage than intern's salary), but I would be stuck in a job I feel would provide me no growth or mobility. 

I feel as taking an internship out of state will give me access to more reputable firms, an industry I want, and give me a possibility of being hired afterwards, but I will have to hustle on an intern's salary to make ends meet constantly with my loans being pushed aside. 

Each option has its pros and cons, what do you think? Am I being unrealistic for wanting to pay off my loans ASAP? Do you disagree about the upward mobility of an administrative position? Please let me know!

I haven't started interviewing for other companies yet but I want to as I will be going into my junior year of college this year with only this past company as experience. Would be nice to branch out more and maybe see what FAANG is like to work for. As such I'll need a polite way to request for adequate time to decide on the return offer.

In addition to time there's also the subject of pay. I've been told by the older interns I befriended that they got paid $35/hr + 2k/month for a housing stipend. However interns aren't expected to accomplish much in the first month or so of the 12 week internship due to usually needing time to become acquainted with the company and ramping up.

What is the first thing you do after waking up? I bet you are just like me. The first thing I do on a morning when I open my eyes is grabbing my phone and check the notifications and of course, check Instagram! Believe it or not, checking my Instagram will boost my brain to start a new day! LOL. Who else is there like me?

I remember there was a time that I wished for a visual (and just optical social media) to share some of my newest shots on it Or to find my old childhood friends and see what they look like now!

https://i.redd.it/8k0jk7m9egf11.png

There was one time I cooked a delicious pizza, and It looked like it came from heaven! I wanted to take a picture from it and show it to every people I meet for the rest of my life! Such a pitty Instagram wasn’t there to help me!

So thank god for Instagram right?

So in this article, I had a little research to find out what is the history of Instagram and why is it this much popular?

**Instagram is the modern cave wall**

Before learning how to write, humans contacted through cave paintings. Why did man find a need to paint on the walls of his caves?

* To communicate with each other.
* To be immortal and be remembered
* To decorate the cave and make life more beautiful with art
* To teach future visitors something
* To express feelings and a lot of other things!

Reread it without considering the cave; it’s like the uses of Instagram! On the other words, Instagram is the modern cave wall for us, so The caveman inspired Instagram!

https://i.redd.it/uxkawtb8egf11.png

This picture above can represent both a hunting expedition or a religious ceremony. Those were the main activities of the Paleolithic man. In conclusion, social networking has been existent since the beginning of humans and will most likely be around until the end of humans.

###### Instagram _ the creation story

This is the real story of how Instagram started working.

It started as a part-time project by Kevin Systrom when he was learning to code. And after he met mike Krieger, they created Instagram! But first, let’s know more about them.

**Biography of co-founders (before Instagram):**

**1- Kevin Systrom**

Kevin was born on 30th December 1983. His mother worked as a marketing executive at zip car, and his father was the vice president of TJX company.

He studied science and engineering management at Stanford University, and he did his intern at Odeo ( the twitter company).

After graduation, he found a job as a marketing associate product manager at Google.

He quit his job in 2009 (after three years) and joined a startup called next stop as a product manager. So he became more close to **social media**.

https://i.redd.it/4lvo4tl7egf11.png

**2- Mike Krieger**

Mike was born on 4th March 1986 in Sao Paulo

He studied symbolic systems at Stanford University (where he met Kevin)

https://i.redd.it/o7ysii27egf11.png

In university, he worked on a photo sharing project for a class. It was an app for treating seasonal affective disorders named “Send me some sunshine.” The idea was that a user would send a photo of sunshine to another user on another side of the world ( with wintery climate and fewer hours of daylight) just to cheer them up.

https://i.redd.it/i8007jl6egf11.png

**early, 2010:**

**self-training after work**

Kevin had no formal training in computer and coding, but he loved it. So while working at the next stop, he learned to code at nights after work and on the weekends, and he learned it by himself.

**Burbn**

After learning to code, he built an HTML5 prototype called burbn ( the name was inspired by his love of fine whiskeys and bourbon ) burbn was an app (multi-faceted) that allowed users to check in, post their plans and share photos like facebook. It was a mix of check-in and gaming \_foursquere and mafia wars!\_ and photo sharing in one app. But it was confusing, so it didn’t succeed.

People were just using the app to share their photo. Coffee photos, dog photos, bathroom mirror photos! Everyday life photos.

This was the time Krieger came on board. He joined systrom in Dogpatch labs at San Francisco’s pier 38.

They looked at how burbn users loved photo sharing and then studied every favorite app in photosharing category.

So they canceled burbn and started over. They spent some time experimenting and searching. There was a prototype for Instagram called scotch, but it didn’t have filters and was full of bugs.

https://i.redd.it/u57bw3y5egf11.png

**Finally!**

After months of trying, Instagram was created and launched on oct.06.2010. 25000 users showed up on the first day!

After that, it was just growing itself. **Instagram nailed the timing and hit one million users in three months!** Then became 2 million which later became ten million users! And it was all organic growth without any advertisements.

https://i.redd.it/omuynjg5egf11.png

**The first photo on Instagram**

The first Instagram photo ever uploaded was the picture of the dolly ( Kevin systrom’s dog) when she was a puppy. Systrom said it was taken at Chilako tacos in Todos Santos.

https://i.redd.it/ugu1y715egf11.png

**The fundings ( series A )**

With Instagram’s massive growth in users, investors became interested. In Jan 2011, the company began to meet with interested parties, and one month after that, Instagram raised about 7 million dollars from a variety of investors including benchmark capital. After that, the company got the attention of the leading companies on social media, twitter and facebook.

This gave systrom and Krieger the opportunity to hire more people, but they kept it lean with a few employees.

**Interests from twitter**

Dorsey knew systrom from his intern time at Odeo, and he had a huge interest in the company. So, in March 2011 he offered around $500 millions in stock, reportedly. Systrom declined, he preferred that Instagram remain an independent company.

By March 2012, Instagram reached to 27 million users, and it was released for Android phones in April. It was downloaded more than one million times in less than one day. The company received a new round of funding at a valuation of $500 million.

**Interests from facebook**

In April 2012, Zuckerberg (the founder of Facebook) made an offer to purchase Instagram for $1 billion in cash and stock, with the provision that the company would remain independently managed. Shortly after that, Facebook acquired the company for $ 1 billion in cash and stock.

**Instagram history timeline:**

* October 6, 2010: Instagram launches
* December 12, 2010: Instagram has 1 million users.
* March 21, 2011: first worldwide instameet
* August 3, 2011: 150 millionth photo upload
* September 20, 2011: introducing version 2.0 with four new filters.
* September 26, 2011: 10 million users!
* November 21, 2011: the launch of weekend hashtag project #VHP
* April 3, 2012: Instagram launches on android too.
* April 9, 2012: Facebook buys Instagram.
* June 28, 2012: Instagram designs photo pages for the web.
* July 26, 2012: Instagram has 80 million users!
* December 11, 2012: Version 3.2 with a new filter.
* December 21, 2012: version 3.4.1 brings 25 languages in.
* May 2, 2013: tag **photos on Instagram**.
* June 20, 2013: introducing videos o instagram.
* December 12, 2013: introducing **Instagram direct**.
* Etc!

Now: Instagram has more than 1 billion monthly active users, up from 800 million in September 2017. Instagram is now one of the most popular social networks worldwide.

https://i.redd.it/9wz39b53egf11.png

**What makes Instagram so popular**

I believe there are some reasons for this success:

1. Instagram allows you to take ordinary photos and make them look extraordinary; this can be compelling.
2. People don’t want to read long texts so they are more interested in watching videos and pictures and this is the baseline of Instagram.
3. It’s simple and easy to use and free!
4. Instagram focused on doing one thing instead of trying to do too many things.
5. It has a lot of fun features and updating by the daily needs of users.
6. Doesn’t contain too many frustrating ads, nothing pops up!
7. You can make an excellent business profile on in and make a lot of money from being an influencer.

I am a 2018 graduate with two exams passed and a GPA between 3 and 3.5 with a math degree. After speaking with an actuary from a major life insurer, I was under the impression that this made me a competitive actuarial candidate. I soon realized that this was not the case as I applied to 50+ positions on the east coast and only received two or three phone interviews and not even one was in-person. 

This has made me a little bit depressed because I have tons of friends who found successful jobs making 100k+ a year, while I have been working at an unrelated dead-end job making sub 50k with many other people in the same role being twice my age. 

Because of recent personal events, I am currently only considering jobs that are located in my metro area(NYC). Should I continue pursuing this career, if I have had so few prospects (and no internships) so far? 

I currently see my options as (1)take the third exam and re-apply to actuary jobs, (2) try and jump into other careers in insurance (like underwriting), or (3) get a masters in statistics/data science to try and get into that type of field. Any type of help or advice would be appreciated.

Thanks!

I am on a graduate scheme at a middle to large tech company. On the scheme we do different jobs every 3/4 months to learn the ins and outs of the company. At the company they hire you as full time on the scheme so it's like I am just another employee. I was offered the job after doing a placement year at the same company while at uni and it's been a year since I joined the grad scheme.

There were 6 people who started on the scheme with me. About a couple of months after we joined I learnt that everyone was on different salaries and I was the lowest paid (£1500 lower than the next person). I was pretty disappointed by this especially since I had the internship under my belt and I got a 1st from a good uni while some of them didn't. But since it was about 2 months into the job I decided not to say anything. After about 6 months, everyone got around a 5% raise. And then, two weeks ago I learnt that the new graduates coming in on the program for this year is also being paid more than what I am on now. At this point I felt more angry than anything else but still have not said anything.

Right now, I am not too sure if I should bring this up since its only been a year, and its only been 6 months since the raise. I really love and enjoy what I do but lately this has always been on my mind.

I should also note I don't have any experience of asking for a raise and this is my first company I worked for ever. Any thoughts on this would help.

Thanks"

96hdi9,1,2018-08-11,Job for a year before returning to school and balancing how to save - 401k versus a Savings Account?,thr0w4w4y1029,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/96hdi9/job_for_a_year_before_returning_to_school_and/,"Hi all,

I'm a 21 year old recent college grad who decided to take a year off before continuing on to law school next fall.  In the interim period, I'm living at home and working to save money, gain experience, etc.  While at home, I will not have to pay rent or for food.  As you can see, this will allow me to save the majority of my income.  My expenses will be:

- Gas for the commute (~4 miles each way. $50/month)
- Flying back to visit my SO cross country (once every 1.5 - 2 months, as we are splitting who does the flying.  $300 for flights &amp; $100 for spending while there), and 
- Recreational spending (~$100/month)


I just got offered a new job at a great company.  The job pays $20 per hour (renegotiable after 4-5 months) and offers overtime.  The HR recruiter I talked to and my future boss said that the summer interns averaged around 50 - 55 hours per week and that I could work even more.

This is a large jump up from my current job ($15/hr - 32 hrs/week) and it also offers benefits.  One of those benefits is a 401k plan.  The company matches 50% of the first 6% of my income I deposit in the 401k, so I guess just 3%, but it only starts to become vested after a couple of years.  At this point, it begins to scale from 25% vesting up to 100%. I made it clear to the company that this job was just for this next year, and they were looking for someone for the same time period.  

So my question is, how is it best to save here?  Should I make use of the 401k even though it doesn't have matching and I won't be able to access it soon?  If so, should I make use of the fact that I'm living at home to save the max possible or find some middle ground? I want to be able to have access to my money for when I return to school - books, room and board, tuition - and am worried about locking up my money and being penalized for early withdrawal.

Thanks!"
96hhw8,3,2018-08-11,MMJ Interview,rlewx,Journalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/96hhw8/mmj_interview/,"I recently had my second ever interview for a MultiMedia Journalist position in a top 70 market. It's my home city and I want this job more than anything else and this would be my first ever on-camera job. The interview went really well and I've met the News Director while in college at our internship fair. I'm now obsessing if I was good enough to get the job. He talked about the job most of the time barely leaving me any room to talk about my qualifications. He was impressed with my reel, though. I think he knew everything he needed to know. I currently work as a part-time producer at another station in this city so I'm in the business already. (struggling juggling two jobs may I add)

I met multiple people in the station including some from the team I'd be working with. At the end of the interview is where it went to an uncomfortable place. He said he was still interviewing and that if anything I can always reach out to him for connections to land a job in another market. I'm so worried that meant another candidate is better than me. He also mentioned if they don't pass the background check then someone else can take their spot. Does this mean I'm a second option? I'm just so worried that I didn't get to show him that I am the best for the job. 

Maybe I can reassure him in my thank you email?"
96hpy5,7,2018-08-11,My [19F] boyfriend [20M] doesn't want me to take an internship opportunity because it clashes with his political/moral views,internthrowaway14,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/96hpy5/my_19f_boyfriend_20m_doesnt_want_me_to_take_an/,"Bf and I are both college students, together for almost 2 years, and I recently got offered a great internship opportunity - it's with a good company, pays really well, and looks like it would be a really great experience for me. It’s also the only internship offer I’ve received for the upcoming term, so the alternative would be doing nothing or continuing my current part-time job that I hate. The problem is that it's in the cybersecurity field, and most of the work that this company does is contract work for the US military. My boyfriend is a pretty hardcore leftist, and is very morally opposed to the military, meaning that he definitely does not approve of me working for them in any capacity. He's been trying hard to convince me not to take this internship, while everyone else in my life is urging me to take it, which has been incredibly stressful. My own political views are similar to my boyfriend's but he feels more strongly than me about pretty much everything - so while I understand his opposition to my taking the job, I don't have a huge problem with working for the military, especially since this is very temporary and I have about the smallest role I possibly could (a tech intern for not even the military itself, but a company contracted by them).

We've talked a lot about it and I've told him that I'm hurt that he can't put aside his politics just this one to think about what's best for me. I think he’s being a little selfish in asking me to turn this down because of his own moral views. Politics have always been a sore spot between us because being politically active is a huge part of his life and I don't really share that passion. But I always thought that if it came down to it he would put me first, and I don't feel like he's doing that now. He says he wouldn't break up with me if I took the job, but I'm worried that it would put so much strain on our relationship that it would fall apart anyway.

Am I wrong for wanting to take this opportunity against his wishes, and thinking that he's being a little selfish for not supporting me? Should I try harder to compromise with him and look for something that we can both be excited about?

tl;dr: I was offered a great internship opportunity with a company that mostly does contract work for the US military, and my boyfriend doesn't want me to take it because of his moral opposition to the military.

\*\* please don't turn this into a political debate, I don't want people to attack my bf for not supporting the military. I just want advice on what I should do about this situation"
96hr4n,18,2018-08-11,Mob Psycho 100 and Yuri!!! on Ice,lov107,anime,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/96hr4n/mob_psycho_100_and_yuri_on_ice/,"I feel like I'm constantly playing catch-up to watch both recent anime releases (past five-ish years) and older classics (2000s and earlier). It didn't help that I was mostly cut off from anime while on my summer internship. So, I'm taking the few weeks before school starts to binge watch some 12-episode shows that I've had on my PTW list forever. I feel so late to the party but hopefully my thoughts are somewhat interesting?

**Ninety-Niiiiiiine**

So I watched all of Mob Psycho 100 on Thursday. I definitely didn't know what I was getting myself into but it was so fantastic! All I knew about the show beforehand was that it was made by the same guy who did OPM and that it had crazy experimental animation. And considering the character designs and the character's power, I was thought Mob would just be psychic Saitama? But it was so much more unique and interesting than I expected. Tying Mob's powers to his emotions was genius, and the 100% scenes were just too hype. I honestly didn't expect the side characters to be as deep as they were. I believed Ritsu would just be a kind younger brother who was sweet and supportive to Mob but nothing more. And I thought Teru would be a rival who showed up to challenge Mob's philosophy every once in a while throughout the season. But, no it was so much better than that. The show was super great at subverting my expectations, especially with Reigen being a surprisingly silly and lovable conman.

On the other hand, sometimes it felt like it was trying to do too much. Like, it starts out slice-of-life and monster-of-the-week, focusing on Mob wanting to be popular. And then, Ritsu gains his powers and Claw kind of comes in... out of nowhere – and the focus of the show shifts completely. Not that each part wasn't individually awesome but they felt a bit disjointed. Perhaps, it'll come together more when the second season is out. 

**We were born to make history!**

I think I've listened to the ""History Maker"" about a hundred times in the past two days. I've only finished the first 9 episodes of Yuri!!! on Ice so far, but just like Mob Psycho 100, I am getting something unexpected out of this show. I knew that it was very gay and had a ton of support on Tumblr. Despite being the target demographic of yaoi, I've never watched that genre because I've never been into the idea of fetishizing a relationship *solely* because it involved gay boys. So I was a bit reluctant to watch the show since I kind of had the idea that the gayness was the only reason that Tumblr liked the show and that perhaps it had no other redeeming qualities. 

But, boy, was I wrong. This show has so much good. The music is fantastic. I could watch the skating all day – the animation is generally amazing, though I can see a few shots where it looks a bit off/stiff. It's really cool seeing the themes and stories that each skater tells with his skating and getting so hype to watch them pull off those crazy difficult moves. Victor and Yuri K.'s relationship is actually very sweet – they actually care about each other and support each other though I wish I could see them actually develop the relationship a bit more. Most surprisingly of all, I had never seen Yurio brought up that much when the show was super popular – Russian Yuri is the true best boy and deserves to win every competition.

So I've totally fallen in love with both of these shows. Any suggestions for other 12(ish)-episode shows that I should watch after I finish YoI? I'm thinking Usagi Drop next but not sure after that. 

EDIT: Yeah, so I finished Yuri!!! on Ice. It was just... so incredible. Yuri K.'s free skate had me cheering. So proud of him. In my head, I'm thinking, ""Yuri's really come so far. His performance was beautiful. And as much as I desperately want Yurio to win, Yuri's probably going to win since he's the main character."" But, no, SURPRISE: ONE TRUE BEST BOY YURIO GOT GOLD. My prayers have been answered. And that pair skate with Victor and Yuri... This show just gave me everything I asked for and more. "
96hv07,3,2018-08-11,[39M4F] Sloppy blowjob scene,FavoriteStranger,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/96hv07/39m4f_sloppy_blowjob_scene/,"I am in the mood to do a scene that ends in a nice sloppy blowjob. A few ideas for starters:

As if you couldn’t be any clumsier. Not only did you lock your cell phone in your car, you left your keys in the ignition too. Great. It's nighttime, and the mall just closed. You don't have much choice but to find someone either willing to call a locksmith or give you a ride home. Maybe that guy walking to his car would help out? You don't have much to trade, but you are getting a little desperate. Without any cash, you are in a tight spot. He hints that if you follow him to his car, he will help with what you need. You may just have to give him what he wants in order to get home.

You have a summer internship with my company, and your boss has had enough of you. You are woefully unqualified and totally over your head. You lied on your resume and can't seem to be able to live up to your promised quality of work. It's clearly not working out, and you are not a good fit for the position at all. He lets you know it would be best for all parties involved if we let you go. Until you end up talking him into letting you give him a blowjob in his office. Well, I suppose we can let you stay on for another week or two.

You are out with friends for a bachelorette party and end up having way too much to drink. Some creep is hitting on another girl at the party. After telling him to get lost, he ends up hitting on you. You're not sure if it's the drinks or the compliments but something about him makes you really horny. He offers to take you upstairs to his hotel room. You would normally never do something like this but for some reason you just can't say know. The only thing you can think about as you sit kneeling on the carpet with his cock sliding in and out of your mouth, is you really hope your husband doesn't find out.

So keep in mind that a lot of details are omitted for the sake of brevity (mainly conversations that my ex and I had). 

* Yes I realize all of what I'm about to say makes me horrible.
* Yes I recognize that I'm probably the biggest asshole here.
* Yes she did deserve better than that.
* Long time lurker.
* First time poster
* Throwaway
* tl;dr at bottom

My senior year of high school I started dating a girl. I was her first boyfriend (which just makes all of this even worse). 

While we were both still in high school and throughout the summer that followed, we were pretty much the perfect couple. Yeah, we had a few problems, but really we were able to talk through any issues that we were having and our relationship focused on having a constant channel of open communication and it worked out extremely well. We were both happy. I considered her to be the perfect girlfriend except for one tiny detail that at the time I didn't realize I would have a problem with: she wasn't ready for sex. At the time she told me that, I didn't think that it would really be an issue, but, well, because you're reading this you know that wasn't the case. Now, I know what you're thinking: ""Oh this guy pressured his younger girlfriend for sex and when she wouldn't have sex with him, he broke up with her."" My fellow Redditor, I wish I could say that was all that I did, but no, I'm afraid I did something far worse. 

Once I had arrived at college, I came in with the mindset of just focusing on my schoolwork and ignoring any girls on campus because I really thought that I was going to marry my ex. That approach worked for about a whole ~~year~~ TWO weeks before I got drunk and ended up having my first threesome on campus. I enjoyed every second of it. I didn't feel bad. And to make matters worse, I told my girlfriend at the time that I was going out and she simply asked that I remember her that night. Arguably the worst part is, I did remember her, I thought about her as I looked at the girl in front of me, and that didn't stop me at all. Maybe a few days later I had a girl over my in my room for a movie night (I think we were finishing Luke Cage S1 for anyone who is interested), and let's say my hands went exploring and I found the holy grail before she left in the morning. About two weeks pass and I decide that I need to tell my girlfriend because the ""guilt"" was getting to me. So I text her and I confess. But me being the asshole that I am, I tell her the the girl initiated things and I kicked her out once I started thinking about her. Much to my surprise, my ex wasn't too upset with me. She was happy that I told her and she said considering things could've been much worse it was okay. Keep in mind all of this was in August. 

By the time Christmas break comes around I had slept with multiple girls and I hadn't and did not plan to tell my ex about any of them. Instead, I opted to have a conversation with her and ask her for an open relationship because I was ~~cheating on her~~ struggling with the rampant temptation in college. She agreed to think about it and for all of January and February I didn't sleep with anybody. Those two months consisted mainly of conversations about us being in an open relationship. The very last conversation we had about that she told me that she was ""starting to be more comfortable with the idea of an open relationship,"" but that conversation happened mid January. In an attempt to not be more of an asshole to her than I had already been, I had offered to not bring it up again and she could reach out to talk to me within the next month: she agreed. It's mid March by the time this is happening and each day she keeps getting too busy (later I found out she was hoping that everything would just end up okay without us having to make this move) to have a conversation and I'm starting to struggle again. One day I send out a few texts and I sleep with someone that night. The next day I text her and confess to her that I cheated on her. I told her that I slept with the ONE person she knew about from first semester. As to be expected she was furious and she felt betrayed among a number of other things. She told me that I was lucky to still have her and she asked me to give her one reason not to leave me. And here's where the worst part comes in. I tell her that it's her fault. It's her fault for not having sex with me in the first place, that if I had something to come home to then this wouldn't even be an issue, that we were moving towards being open anyway so it didn't matter, and that she made things worse by avoiding talking about it.... Somehow, someway, she believed me, apologized to me, and agreed to having an open relationship. 

The rest of the school year goes by uneventfully. When I arrived home for the summer I found that she had told everyone that was a member of a club we used to do together in high school (basically my entire friend group from High School) that I had cheated on her. None of them wanted anything to do with me and I went off on my ex. I told her that she drug my name through the mud so that she could save face and not admit her own fault in having caused that. She believed me and apologized profusely. We fought for a few more weeks, we took a break, and at the end of the break I broke up with her (it was a very mutual decision, but I said the words first just so I could say I broke up with her). 

* Yes I had it coming.
* No she doesn't know. 
* We didn't end up breaking up because I cheated on her oddly enough. I got an internship and she was doing a million college visits and international trips, so we didn't have time for each other.
* Yes, again, I know I'm an asshole. 

TL;DR : I cheated on my girlfriend with multiple people, told her about ONE instance, made her believe that it was her fault so that I could be in an open relationship, and still broke up with her. "

Question",VillageSageWitch,physicaltherapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/physicaltherapy/comments/96ico4/pt_applicant_does_your_academic_record_accurately/,"Hello, I was wondering if I should fill this out on the PTCAS application or just leave it blank. My cumulative GPA is around 3.4 and prereq GPA is around 3.1. When I started college I was a computer science major still figuring out what I wanted and got an F in an online HTML class. However, at the time I was just taking it for fun (it wasn't a requirement) to see if I liked it, but started an internship that was much more complicated/relevant at the time (programming with angular JS) and stopped working on class projects to focus on the job. I got a B in javascript and an A in graphic design that same summer. Is this situation worth explaining?

Also, I had to retake chem II twice, yikes, I know. First got an F, then a D, and finally passed with a B. I had a lot of anxiety about chem (including panic attacks) and went to the school counselor/therapist at the end of my second time taking it. Are either of these things worth mentioning? 

Thank you so much."

96ivfy,2,2018-08-11,I(24M) just broke up with my girlfriend(25F) and I cannot get over it. It feels like a waste.,needstotalk76,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/96ivfy/i24m_just_broke_up_with_my_girlfriend25f_and_i/,"Good evening everyone. Thank you for reading me and giving advices.  


Little background on my sentimental life: I am very very picky but I do not have difficulties meeting girls. I went on lots of tinder date and refused to contnue with the girls that liked me because I could not imagine something serious with them. And I was in a college were casual flings were the norm but it was never something I seriously considered.  


 I met C in September she was an exchange student and we started spending lots of time together and she was the best study partner. At some point I fell in love and she did too. We started dating in October but we were very close. We were basically leaving at each other's place sharing everything. We had plan together to both find jobs in the same city and live together. Both her and I were looking for something serious.  But she had to go she was only there until  the end of December. I was convinced that she was the woman I wanted to spend my life with and I was ready to do a LDR for her.

And since she had no courses in the spring semester I offered to visit her or she could come. But in the end she was sick, then she was busy writing her thesis then she had a very stressful internship (working 90+ hours a week). So she said she couldn't come and when I was asking her it was never the right time to come. I was always there supporting her through the sickness sending lots of messages, calling her, sending her cards. After the internship obviously since she worked so hard she got a full time position. Unfortunatly with the stress she had become very cold and I was very happy that she was finished and wanted to plan holidays together. And there she told me that she can't do a long distance relationship because she has to perform in her new job (same idea 90+ hours a week must be available to answer during week-ends) to be able to relocate and that her career is what means the most to her. And I offered to be the one travelling and making more effort because I was willing to do this sacrifice for her. Then I looked for jobs in her country but was not accepted and she was "" I don't want you to come to my small country, yours is much better you will be unhappy and you know no one"". She wanted us to break up and stay friends but I cannot be only her friend. So i said that we should break-up and she took it very poorly. 

In the end I decided to come without telling her and go see her before she starts working again. We had 3 amazings days she was again the girl I fell in love with and she told me that she loved me and that I meant a lot to her. But still she did not wanted a LDR so I decided to try her method and just be friends and maybe when she relocates in 2 years we could be together. It was in June and I realized that basically we were acting the same our relationship was boyfriend/girlfriend just without the name and without her acknowledging it. But I was investing a lot emotionally and I was very unhappy because I wanted at least to be exclusive. And I was very stressed that she would find someone els and I would have done all this for nothing but I swallowed the pill for almost 2 months and I focused on not showing so she could be happy because she had started her work again and I wanted to support her. All this time I was putting her happiness before mine, probably a misstake. 

And I decided to write her a letter explaining my feelings that I loved her and that unfortunatly I was not happy in the current state and that I would like her to make more efforts. I am in the same industry than her so I realize how hard and demanding this job is and I was only asking for a few messages a day maximum ten minutes in total and maybe sometimes a call on week-ends. But more than that I wanted to now if she wanted to be with me. And the answer she gave me is ""I love you but since we are not living together I cannot decideand I prefer to rpioritize my career over my feelings"" But I never asked her to abandon anything I just wanted her to show more comitment. She decided it was not worth it but refuses to understand why I need to go no contact and why I do not want to just be her friend.

I feel so disappointed that it finishes like this because she clearly has feelings for me and I am not asking for much and I have done so much efforts to make it work. I just feel it is unfair because if we were in the same location it would have never happened like this. I cannot understand how you can sacrifice everything for your job even when it is unnecessary.  


TL,DR: Because of distance and career I had to break-up and go no-contact with my girlfriend and I am incredibly sad and disappointed because I love her an she does love me but ""she cannot afford the luxury of love right now"""

They said they were pleased with my work and that I picked up things fast but because I didn’t network enough they couldn’t give me an offer. 

I don’t get it. I worked as hard as I possibly could. When I had questions I would ask the senior or person in charge of the project. They told me that they wish they saw me ask all employees questions and to not focus on just one person all the time. Shouldn’t I ask the person in charge of the project as opposed to asking 3-4 co workers who might or might not know the question. I thought being able to show I’m a good worker who is willing to learn would get me this offer but I guess not. 

In fairness I didn’t goof around with my co workers as much as some of the other interns. Kinda wish I could just go back and just talk to as many co workers as I can instead of just showing I can do a tax return. Oh well I guess lesson learned. Hard work doesn’t always pay off.  "

I'm a recent grad and procastinating all summer because I made a stupid mistake in not choosing a internship. So I'm hoping I can find someone on here thats interesting to talk too and hope I'm interesting to them too! 

I'm a food fanatic, i like to watch good TV shows and movies. I'm not stuck to one genre but the movie has to be decently rated. The most recent movie I've seen was the Truman show and suprised how well the move was thought out.

I'm also into music and tend to go for old school rock, ambient music. I used to listen to alot of rap but I'm starting to get sick of it because of the generic style that most of the genre has. I'm open to all recommendations but I may not be listening to that genre so you'll have to excuse my ignorance.... I'm a geek so I like learning about new stuff 😎 (also maths ❤️)

Sorry for my long message but I'm open to anyone and everyone as long as you share atleast an interest or like the look of my post! I'm from the UK btw"
96j1dd,2,2018-08-11,3-Year degree Track,Fluid_CS,cuboulder,https://www.reddit.com/r/cuboulder/comments/96j1dd/3year_degree_track/,"Hello,
I am a freshmen to attend this fall. I am coming in with 39 credit hours of transfer credit, and I intend to be a CS major from the college of engineering; I would like to specialize in systems &amp; networking. I started to make a 4-year plan recently (in the attached link bellow), and found that even if I take 15-17 credit hours a semester - and no summer terms - I'll likely graduate in 3 years. To my knowledge, this course outline would cover all the degree requirements. So my question is: is it worth sticking to this plan? Would this aid in employment in some way, or could graduating early make it infact more difficult? (I'll likely do an internship regardless while in school)

Additionally, I have another question. After the first semester of my sophomore year, I would be eligible to apply the BS/MS program. Given that the MS degree will require at least an 30 additional credits, it then seems to me like it's possible to finish the BS/MS program in 4 years, or at the very least 4 years and one semester. Does that sound feasible? Would this perhaps be better?

The real question is, why am I a secret?

1) You're just plain tired of your love life being front page news on the gossip websites

2) I am scandalously younger than you, maybe not even old enough to drive to see you

3) Officially you're my boss (intern, PA, actor on your first project behind the camera, etc... )

4) We are related. Top choice is brother/sister but open to cousins, aunt/nephew, or even mother/son

5) I live out in some rural small town that could not handle the news you were visiting, much less sleeping with me

6) Some combination of the above. Most of these are not mutually exclusive, and some even work better together

As for kinks and limits, I'm pretty vanilla... specifically into agegaps, incest, cumplay, oral, teasing, body worship, and maybe anal or impreg... but let me know what you're into as long as it's consensual and no scat, gore, blood, bimbo, drug use, non-con, or BDSM as those are my hard limits.

96kfi5,3,2018-08-11,NetSec Noob :),Tidesofchill,NetworkSecurity,https://www.reddit.com/r/NetworkSecurity/comments/96kfi5/netsec_noob/,"Hello r/NetworkSecurity,

I am a first-year student at a tech college in the southwestern region of the United States. I am currently pursuing a triple major, for a BS in Network Security, Network Forensics and Network Engineering.
I am completely new to network security, and my second semester will be completed later this month.

During my first semester, I covered topics such as personal security (identity security), basic physical network topology (OSI, etc), Python coding and other minor security essentials.
Upon my second semester’s finish, I managed to get my hands around server management, through Windows Server 2016. A lot of our work includes hands-on labs, systems management virtualization (VMware) and other Server essentials. This includes WSUS, AD, PowerShell and GPOs. A ton of our deliverables included Visio network diagrams, work study write-ups, memorandums and APA formatted papers as to why we did what we did within Windows Server.

This semester was extremely exciting to me, as it’s my first real look at Server security and network management. 

I am pretty nervous about my third semester, as I’m nearing the semester in which I’ll apply myself to an internship. I’ve been looking into possible internships at MegaPlanet, McKesson and other companies.

I wanted to come to this subreddit today to ask all of the industry experienced redditors...
What’s the standard that an industry network security professional will expect from me?
What can I get my hands on to make learning everything easier for me?
Are there any pro tips for someone pursuing my majors?

If anyone reading this has any of these degrees, please get into contact with me somehow, as I have so many damn questions, haha.

Lastly,

How can I prepare myself for the internship? I would love any information about how I can better myself; i.e. programs, notable protocols/procedures, what to expect, etc.

Tl;dr,

I’m a NetSec noob that’s stressing about their application to the field of network security. Any tips on how to succeed in the field, what to learn or how to continuously innovate my purpose for the greater good of the field ... would be great!

Thank you for reading, and if you’re in the industry currently, or have any experience whatsoever with this field, don’t hesitate to reach out! I would really appreciate any and all help.

96l5vc,2,2018-08-11,[M4F] Petplay Is Supposed To Be Fun For Everyone Involved.,TheHeightofVice,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/96l5vc/m4f_petplay_is_supposed_to_be_fun_for_everyone/,"Sarah Broges was a well-respected professional. She had worked her way up in the corporate world after having entered with no relevant qualifications. Armed with nothing but an eagerness to learn and a desperate need to excel and outcompete, she had become one of the most powerful women in the company's history.

Nearing thirty and nestled comfortably in an executive position, she was used to a certain amount of authority and power over those below her. Whether it was teasing and overworking the interns or being an iron cunt to the coworkers she had left behind on her ascent through the corporate ranks, she took joy in reaping the fruits of her efforts. She wasn't a bad person, per se, it was just that she knew how to get what she wanted.

Sarah Broges also had a secret.

It started when she was just about to enter her twenties. Never having popular in highschool, she had entered adulthood without much experience with men. The internet had provided an avenue for the male attention that her raging hormones demanded and, over the next few years, she had managed to lose herself in the culture of exhibitionism.

At first it was as innocuous as showing a bit of cleavage on her blog. And then her panties. By the time she was twenty-one, she had shown every inch of herself. She had also developed a fairly loyal following.

By the time she started working as an intern, she was taking requests. Posing in various positions, wearing outfits and lingerie that her fans supplied, and even roleplaying as a participant in their various, weird kinks. That was where her love of petplay began. The first time she slipped on the collar provided by a long-time devotee, she for the first time felt as though she had found her own identity. Whether she was being a kitty, bunny, bitch, or fox, she never felt more free and turned on than when she was able to leave her professional identity behind. Even if it was only for one or two hours a night.

It had been many years since then. The blog was a relic of the past, though she still saw pictures and videos of herself reposted every now and again. She had learned to satisfy herself by browsing the submissions of younger, more beautiful women. She simply did not have the time to indulge anymore.

She did this at work, of course. It was the perks of having her own office and the IT boy wrapped around her finger. It wasn't like she had anything better to do. Her position required very little other than the ability to yell at people whose only failing was not exceeding expectations. It did leave her lots of time to exchange emails with a gentleman she had gotten in contact with only a few months prior. He was polite, charming, and well-spoken. All while being dominant enough to warrant keeping a spare pair of panties and a ziploc bag in her purse.

                                            ****
Sarah Broges was the most pathetic little thing you had ever seen. She had a tendency to attempt hiding her naked flesh with her hands when her owner rattled the cage every morning to wake her up. She had been in this man's possession for...a while. She wasn't sure how long it had been anymore.

He crouched and unlocked the cage, opening the door and stepping away from it as he spurred her into motion with a snap of his fingers. Her joints ached after spending the night coiled into the corner to conserve her own warmth. Her skin burned after hours of the metal digging into her flesh. She knew the marks would remain for days. And that it was intended.

She kept to her hands and knees, eyes directed at the floor as her owner closed the door behind her. She had tried to escape before. She had even overheard the police interviewing him while she remained, bound and gagged, in the basement of his house. Her body was covered in the markings of her most recent punishments. Sometimes she wished the welts and bruises wouldn't heal so he couldn't find smooth skin to abuse.

With another snap of his fingers, she moved to a kneeling position. She sat on her heels as he circled in front of her. His finger moved to her chin and he forced her gaze to shift towards his face. She hated how normal he looked. She almost wished he was an ugly, evil man or an exceptionally, if not deceptively, handsome one. He just looked ""normal"" and that was the most terrifying thing about him.

She opened her mouth to speak. To beg for him to let her go. She would leave and never return. She would swear that she wouldn't report him to the police and the worst part was that she meant it, too. She just wanted this to be over.

As her mouth opened, his hand moved forward and before she could form the words his middle and pointer fingers were already hooked onto her lower jaw. His fingertips pressed painfully into the floor of her mouth making it impossible to bite him, even if she wanted to.

His expression was soft. Gentle, even. His free hand brought a collar - her collar - from where he kept it and he fit it snugly around her neck. ""Oh you,"" he said in a deep, soothing voice. ""You know I love it when you think you're people but you're going to have to be quiet today. I'm not in a very good mood.""

Sarah Broges nodded. Animals can't speak, after all. She remained silent and still as he latched the collar in place. It almost choked her but she was used to it. With another snap of his fingers, she returned to her hands and knees before proceeding to crawl towards the stairs.

The worst thing about her situation, and the part that was the most torturous, was that she had never in her life considered how dreadfully boring a dog's life must be."
96lbxv,59,2018-08-11,"[First timer] Appalled at the things kids get away with, nowadays. Maybe I was raised by too strict a family?",matildemp,childfree,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/96lbxv/first_timer_appalled_at_the_things_kids_get_away/,"Hey, everyone! Long time lurker, first time poster. I'm 21/F/Italian who had the fortune of spending half her life in Shanghai, China. To... you know... Italian parents. Which meant that although they were quite strict with me (no going out on a weeknight, always tell us where you're going and who with, studium et stadium, all the good stuff), they were nevertheless quite fair. Every punishment I received was truly one I deserved. They never laid a hand on me that I hadn't implicitly asked for with my dumbass, hormonal clapbacks and generally difficult personality - one that I've only really been able to manage due to this pretty just treatment. 

An example of this was me sneaking out of the house at age 14 in order to go clubbing (Shanghai is very different, y'all. Anyone need bar/club recommendations, PM me). I didn't tell my parents (obviously), and my mother nevertheless found out (obviously). Grounded for a year - no parties, no clubs, no going out on weekends past sundown, no sleepovers. After that, I was allowed to go to bars and even clubbing, but only if one of my parents could pick me up at a set time and location. After that infamous incident, I was never late. Not once.

Anyways, so I come from a strict family with high standards, fine. I'm spending my summer in Shanghai for my internship, and because my parents are busy moving houses, I decided to find a Chinese host family to stay with, so I could stay out of their hair. They have a cute, 7-year-old daughter, whom they spoil rotten. I have never seen kids get away with similar things: throwing toys, breaking bowls and cutlery, slapping her parents (!!!! TO THE CHOKEY), and general screaming. She has sung 'Let It Go' more times than I ever thought imaginable. Are children's vocal chords made of reinforced steel? How does she still have a voice? She doesn't even sing it well (obviously).

When I politely asked one of the parents why they let her do all that, they just replied, ""oh, you know, we love her,"" or some weak response to the effect of, ""kids will be kids - she'll grow and learn soon enough."" Obviously, not soon enough. She's 7 years old and whines all day about all the classes her parents make her do (this is a very common Chinese practice in order to foster a well-balanced child; swimming lessons, dance lessons, piano lessons, English lessons abound), and then just plays the same episode of Dora the Explorer at eardrum-splitting volumes at 8 in the morning on weekends.

Was I just raised in an unnaturally strict family? Is it normal for me to want to slap a 7-year-old? The thing is, I know (in my darkest, deepest heart of hearts) that it's not the child's fault - at least, not completely. Her parents made her this way. I just get the urge to sometimes sit them down and go, ""I'm sorry, but you're the grownup here. You need to discipline your child, she can't just be singing all the time. She needs to understand that she's not the only person on Earth."" When I say discipline, of course I'm biased because of my strict upbringing (just slap her once, maybe that'll shock her, I really don't know at this point), but at this point, even something as minor as a sit-down would basically be Christmas coming early.

When I think of my Chinese classmates way back in middle and high school, none of them were like this! Hardworking, nice, a bit socially awkward. Sure, maybe some of them spent a little too long on their phones at lunchtime, but nobody was truly spoilt. 

3 more weeks in this house, guys... 3 more weeks. Patience truly is a virtue."

96lgd2,1,2018-08-11,I can get a raise with one HUGE caveat...,whennorametnancy,Casual_Conversation,https://www.reddit.com/r/Casual_Conversation/comments/96lgd2/i_can_get_a_raise_with_one_huge_caveat/,"If I accept said raise they will fire my coworker!

I will not be accepting the raise as I wish to sleep at night.

Backstory: I moved to a new state and found a business that looked beyond cool. It is in a creative field: screen printing, has wonderful branding and has a social media presence that exudes awesome products with playful culture. I wanted to work there and I wanted it bad. While not directly experienced in the same industry, I had previously worked in a field that had related skills with plenty of crossover (dye sublimation printing and laser cutting/engraving) and a degree that lends skills to the industry as well (BFA in Illustration.) Long story short: they weren't hiring for a creative role, but offered me an internship. The pay was $4.50 less than what I made hourly before and I still accepted thinking that 3 months isn't that long to prove my worth and become an asset to the company.

3 months passed (with full time work and, I confidently believe, excellent work) and then limbo set in. While the last intern ended her internship with a salaried position and pay to match my appointment with my supervisor and owner kept getting pushed off.

My 6 month anniversary rolls around and finally they make time for me to discuss my future with the company. I should add, I've loved the type of work I'm doing, most of it has fallen into the ""production artist"" world with a few creative projects here and there. I daily take pieces of art and make them screen print ready.  I get to work with both the art world and the production world and act as the bridge from one to the  other. I love it. There's enough thought that I find myself challenged and I seem to excel. Throughout this time and overall I've been told I'm doing a wonderful job. The company is also young, so I've spent a ton of personal time writing standard practices to make what I do easier for myself and others as none of this was created beforehand. My thought is that if I keep a list of rules and exceptions then we can cut down on errors saving the company time, money and headaches along the way.

And so we meet. The owner and my boss both reiterate how much they wish to keep me there. I voice my concerns, namely: pay, wondering what my role is, and if I will get more creative projects in the future. It seems like it goes well. My direct supervisor tells my employer that I'm even more of an important asset to the team than the last ""intern to hire"" and says, I quote, ""a more important member than (insert said co-worker's name)."" I'm feeling good leaving because I've kicked butt, had plenty of positive feedback, am dilligent in what I do and have both the skills of production and art under my belt. The owner asks me to wait a week to consider how he wishes to proceed.

A week rolls around and I am told that I will be given a raise if I commit to making a year commitment to the company AND they will fire the other intern to fund said raise. They had just offered to let her stay on part time through the fall so I'm shocked that my raise is contingent upon her employment especially considering how dilligent and consistent of a worker she's been, even more so in comparison to my other full time colleges. My boss goes on to say that he doesn't think what I do takes skill and so I will likely never reach my finalcial goals with the company because he can always hire someone new and train them, BUT if I decide to leave he would like for me to give a 60 day notice because it will take that much time to train a new hire.

So I'm shocked, not only is the raise well below the national average and regional average for the work I do, it is even below a liveable wage for the city we live in,  but if I stay I will have the knowledge that my decision leads fo another person getting fired and a person who is hard working, smart and helpful at that. I'm devastated. I love the type of work I do, I enjoy my co-workers and think the industry has so much potential for growth and creativity.  However, the ethics of the whole thing are sickening.

I'm frustrated, but I'm not alone. Of our 30ish employee team, 8 people have quit in the last 6 months and last year's Christmas card depicts half of the faces as unrecognizable. High turnover is key in how the owner keeps his bottom line low. Seniority leads to higher wages, so push them out while you can.

I have until Friday to accept the raise. I won't accept it. I am looking for new employment, even though I love what I do, I want to be able to sleep at night and also reach my financial goals. I'm frustrated because I am good at what I do and wish to continue doing it, but the owner had made it clear that to do so I must compromise my values and selfworth. This may fall less into the casual conversation realm and more into a rant, but redditers it sure was cathartic to put my experience into words. "

96m6q6,2,2018-08-11,(CAN) My company will be paying me a student rate after leaving the student work term. Am I being taken advantage of?,pointonethree,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/96m6q6/can_my_company_will_be_paying_me_a_student_rate/,"Background: In Canada, we have a system of paid internships called co-ops.  Your co-op work term is paid, and also counts for credits or is just required to graduate with the co-op distinction in your diploma/degree.

-----

I was hired by my employer in January as a co-op student.  I joined a small programming team with a large backlog of work at a rate of $20/hour.  This rate is actually generous, as the 'recommended' rate from the college to be expected to be paid is $16-$18/hour.  So far, great.

8 months later, I'm getting ready to finish this work term and go back to school.  I will be back in class from September to December, and then will graduate.

Because of this, I will continuing my role part time, and then in January, resuming full time.  When I do go full time, I will be expecting a rate of $30/hour minimum, and hoping to get $35/hour.

I asked my boss (actually, my supervisor's boss) if I will see a new rate when I work part time reflecting the fact that I am no longer a co-op student who doesn't know anything, but am now in fact a contributing member of the team with growing responsibilities and deliverables.

I was told, however, that since I am not graduated yet, I still fall under the co-op category.  Therefore I will still be getting my co-op rate, and I can re-negotiate my salary when I go full-time.

I guess logically, this makes sense to me, but I feel a little... pissed.  I'm going to be working on several major projects in the next month and I'm good at my job now and I'm going to be making the same money as I was when I knew nothing about our platform.

Should I make some noise about this and see if I can do anything to change their minds, or just suck it up?"
96n47u,83,2018-08-12,When should I stop?,AlbertHockman,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/96n47u/when_should_i_stop/,"I am 22 years old, 6'0 and almost 300 lbs.

I just started working out around three weeks ago after having not worked out for around four years. 

I try to lift weights 3x a week and ride my bike 5x a week for cardio. I have someone to guide me with the excersizes for the most part but they workouts they are used to working very intensely and following their advice to a tee has left me almost immobile multiple days for being so sore. I do not have difficulty at all lifting the weight that he thinks would be good for me and I feel a really nice burn as we are excersizes, but the day after the next I have difficulty doing basic motions. 

I think I am overworking my self, but I have a hard time understanding when I need to stop. If knowing when to stop is not the issue and the soreness is normal, is there anything I can do to expedite the healing process so I am not wasting 3 days not at the gym resting? I am starting to really enjoy the feeling of pushing my body and eating healthier (note: not healthy but healthier - think Jimmy John's vs Taco Bell, hoping to eventually get used to making lunches before work and eating healthy all together, baby steps). 

I would really like to give my full each time but I'm afraid of the consequences of over doing it. Does anyone have any advice?

TL;DR: obese 22 year old trying to get fit, over does at gym and needs advice on moderating self.

Edit: As far as diet goes, I know that what my diet currently is not sufficient for any significant weight loss and I am definitely wanting to fix that. I don't want to waste my excersizes and hard work on a meal. The biggest hurdle I have when it comes to eating healthy is figuring out how to handle lunch at work! I just started working around a month and a half ago and never really made my own lunches for school or my internships. I would be more than receptive on advice on having a money and health concsious lunch at work! I want to thank every that's replied so far. I have and will continue reading each one of them!"

96nex2,57,2018-08-12,Extended Family Compound and its Disadvantages,PkmnTrainerArtie,Philippines,https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/96nex2/extended_family_compound_and_its_disadvantages/,"Here's the deal. I just want to share how having a residential compound with extended family members is a major disadvantage. For starters, our extended family is patriarchal, so 3 out of my father's siblings have their houses built inside my grandfather's lot. Time went by, our family became financially stable while the others lived like one-day millionaires. I also have constantly lived in an environment where my cousins and even my aunts and uncles would spend their whole afternoon in our house watching TV or worse loiter in either my bedroom or even my sister's bedroom (My siblings and I never do this at their houses). They would barge into our bedroom without even knocking. Sometimes these relatives would freely open our fridge and consume any food they can find in it. My dad was very lenient with this but my mom who's not really their blood relative is really pissed when this happens since she is the one in charge of budgeting our food. My mom does not really say a word to any of them with regards to this behavior and neither are my siblings. However, my mom usually vents out to us with regards to this.

There was one time when I was in college, I came home very tired and hungry from my hospital internship. I checked the fridge for food and was glad to see that there still was leftover lunch in it. I took a bath first since I had the habit of taking a bath every time I finish my duty at the hospital. When I was ready to eat, to my horror and dismay, I saw my cousin eating the lunch I was planning to eat. With all the frustrations and anger that was welling up inside me I burst them all out at him. I got mad that they have no right to eat the food that is exclusively for us. I also got mad that they were invading the privacy not only of our living room but also our bedrooms. He ran out the house not finishing the food he was eating and perhaps to tell his parents about my tirade.

With that incident, life had somehow changed in our home. My cousins no longer get food that was not really offered to them. My uncles and aunts however, still had the nerve to loiter in our house. So to counter it, I always lock my room. My sister and brothers were more welcoming to them but I value my privacy more than anything else at that moment since I need lesser distractions when I'm reading a novel or reviewing or watching a movie or TV series.

Financial misfortune took a toll on most of my relatives in the residence. My uncle's (my dad's eldest sibling and the father of the cousin whom I scolded for the food) house's electricity was disconnected. They begged my parents to have their connection jacked to our electric connection with the promise of paying justly to which I doubt. I warned my mom about this. She told me she couldn't do anything since it was not in her place to disapprove since she was not a blood relative. They already have abused my mom's kindness. They borrowed money from her without even paying it back until this year. They even were borrowing my dad's vehicles to my inconvenience since I was using our van for my internship. I can see my mother's silent suffering with this setup. I was not wrong. They did not keep their hold of the bargain. Every time my mom has to pay for the monthly electrical bills they would mostly give a meager share despite of the amount of the total bill doubling to what it usually was. My cousins on the other hand had even have the nerve to waste electricity by playing video games all night in their home. I was itching to get mad at them but I kept cool about it.

Time came when I got married and my wife and I settled first in my parents house initially. My aunt and uncles never changed their behavior around our house. They loitered more in it and worse in our (my former) bedroom to get to know more about my wife. I then apologized to my wife about the nosiness of my relatives and kept our bedroom locked as always to keep my relatives away from it. I could sometimes hear the doorknob turn in the attempt of opening the door without even knocking. I was still pissed by it.

Time came when my wife and I moved to a house in the city when we had kids. The house was just 2 kilometers away from my former residence. Visits from my parents and siblings were okay. But when my aunts and uncles and cousins visit and spend their whole afternoon in the residence of my own family that was when finally I had it. We had our family group chat on Facebook where I vented out all of my bottled feelings for them this whole time. I also told them the things my mother could not tell them on her behalf such as her being tired of the ""utang kalimutan"" mentality of theirs. That they were abusing my mom's kindness. It is for them to realize that they are parasitic good for nothing relatives who needs to stand up on their own. Hell they are still leeching off electricity from my parents house without even properly paying for it. I told them to sever all their ties with me. I am the oldest among my cousins and I don't give a crap about what my clan would say. I just want my family's privacy that's all. My wife could not even feel secure even in our own house. Heck my uncle even told me, ""Ay ganun di na pwedeng pumunta sa inyo? Akala ko isang pamilya tayo?"" I mean what the hell? I wanted my family to have a peace of mind. If it was my own brothers and sisters who would visit, then it would be fine by me but by extended family members to hell with them and their effed-up mentality. I'm tired of all this BS since I was a kid.

Edit: Additonally, my uncle 'accidentally' called my wife ""Brenda"" as in brain damage during one of the conversations in the group chat. He was apologetic to my wife. Never again would I socialize with these suckers.

Second edit:  Speaking about my dad, he really does not have the nerve to stand up against his brothers and sister. I admire his generosity, what I don't like is it is at our expense. My parents house is like their local pharmacy, grocery and vehicle rental service. We are inconvenienced when it is his children's turn to need some medicine, food or the car's usage since they have already been used or eaten by my relatives. Hell, sometimes my other uncle (the youngest) would really steal some goods that my mom has bought for stock such as canned goods, soaps, and shampoos.

My queries are the following:

1. I did the right thing of accosting them right?
2. Did I do my mother a service by venting out her feelings against my clan through me?
3. Is it okay to sever my ties with my extended family (except for my grandpa)?
4. Have you had the same ordeal with your extended family members?"

So during college, I always had my eyes on this beautiful girl, she's shy, she doesn't talk much and very consious about her image and look all the time! we were friends at university for two years, during those years I never dated anyone, and she hasn't either.

after we graduated, I decided to tell her how much I liked her all that time but I decided to hold my feelings because I wasn't ready to deliver.. still am not ready to deliver and yet I decided to just tell her about my hidden feelings, she felt the same and was happy to hear it and we're just two love birds happy chatting all day on whatsapp.. right, that...

the girl does not get out the house whenever she pleases, conservative family, shy and respectful to her parents, during this time of being together from a distance, the only time I got her to go out was after 7 and that's when she gets out of her internship, now that the internship is over and she's sitting at home she can't leave the house anymore. unless if it's with her family.

she has no girl, guy friends, just a bunch of followers on instagram, facebook, she keeps the likes and deletes the comments even my lovy dovy comments... too respectful of her family?

we talk all day on whatsapp, every hour, every minute, we video chat and we call. but im getting tired of not seeing her everyday or even 3 times a week..

she's very slow and talks less.. and when I bring it up to her she says that she is like that by nature, not much of a talker..

Should I wait on this girl or should I find someone else, i'm starting to fall for her and I just want to see her more and as long as she's not working or doing something outside, we cant see eachother and it's killing me! she's a princesse in the true sens of the word and that's my only problem is that I don't see enough of her!

what should I do!!!

**TL;DR; : Girlfriend too respectful of parents, can't take her out, she finds it okay to just chat on social media all day, Sould I keep her or should I leave**"

**6,656** *Wonder Fans* for **7 Years!**

 
The /r/WonderWoman subreddit is Dedicated to Wonder Woman in all her many forms: comics, TV, cartoons, film, and merchandise. You can also expect to see some wonderful art made by fans and members of the community!

r/WonderWoman boasts a dedicated mod team, a stunning layout, and a welcoming community where fans young and old can come connect over the most iconic female superhero. While the subreddit has been running for around seven years the activity and participation have increased with the success of Wonder Woman's first feature length film, and its sequel currently filming. This is truly a wonderful time to be a fan and I would really recommend joining the ever growing community. 

I have had a wonderful experience every time I've frequented, the sub the community is really open to new users and from my experience just want to help if someone has something they would like to know about the character. They even have trade lists for those who are new to Wonder Woman and want to expand their knowledge of the character. These trade link posts contain information about all the trade collections of Wonder Woman and their contents.
   
Now, let's hear from the mods of /r/WonderWoman!

&gt;#1. What motivated you create/moderate this sub?

&gt;&gt;**u/Ohmsta**  Honestly, my love of Wonder Woman. When I started as a mod, there were fewer than 600 members on the board. I wanted to turn this place into a worthwhile source of discussion and information for Wonder Woman fans new and old.

&gt;&gt;**u/Fhtagn-Dazs**  The same as Ohmstar, I just love Diana and all she represents. I brazenly messaged the mods here more than 2 years ago asking if I could join the team and here I am. 

 

&gt;##What's moderating the sub like? 

&gt;&gt;**u/Ohmstar**  Super chill. Despite many attempts, we don't have a large amount of activity, and most of the conversation is civil. When something big happens, like her movie release, things get a little more hectic. We have a great community of users. 

&gt;&gt;**u/Fhtagn-Dazs**  I was very ill recently and I'm enjoying a time free of a lot of the usual life turbulence, I wake up every day and check the mod queue and it gives me a sense of purpose that I otherwise would have lacked. It's quiet here but I enjoy that we're free of the political nonsense a lot of reddit is swayed by. I don't think I've ever had to deal with something worse than people trying to blatantly sell stuff. 

 

&gt;##What has been your favorite incarnation of Wonder Woman so far?

&gt;&gt;**u/Ohmstar**  Can I say all of them? Honestly, I've loved so many versions of Diana that it'd probably be easier to list the ones I don't like (haha). The version of Diana that I return to the most often is George Perez's '87 reboot. His whole run, including the period after he stopped doing the artwork, is this gorgeous epic tale. Every time I re-read it, I discover some new layer. I love the way Aaron Lopresti draws Diana. So vibrant. I have a tattoo of his Wonder Woman artwork.

&gt;&gt;**u/Fhtagn-Dazs**   I love the Greg Rucka Diana from Volume 2. I've been re-reading it recently, and there's a very good reason as to why it's so iconic at this stage. But Alex Ross' art of her in his work, and his one shot Spirit of Truth is so definitive as well. 

  

&gt;##What are some of your favorite posts on the sub?

&gt;&gt;**u/Ohmstar**  I always look forward to creating the Upcoming Wonder Woman Collected Editions threads. I love collecting Wonder Woman in trade and hardcover, so I enjoy when the new catalogs are out. My favorite posts are the fan art and cosplay images. I love seeing all of the different interpretations of Diana, and all of the people inspired by her.

&gt;&gt;**u/Fhtagn-Dazs**  I like seeing people cosplay her too. I love seeing all the fan art that gets posted. I upvote all of it because it's clear that people put their heart into it, and she'd be appreciative of all of their effort just as I am. I personally enjoy uploading comic book screenshots so that casual comic movie fans might be swayed into venturing into the scary world of the Wonder Woman graphic novel lol.

 

&gt;##Do you have anything to say to the present and future subscribers? 

&gt;&gt;**u/Ohmstar**  I want this sub to be a fun, enjoyable place to share and discuss Wonder Woman. Feel free to message the mods with any ideas you may have! And if anyone can create great looking subs and banners, please reach out.

&gt;&gt;**u/Fhtagn-Dazs**   I want to say to have the same attitude as her when it comes to commenting and posting. This is a positive subreddit, we all share a love of a character who is known for being kind and giving. Lets follow her example as much as possible. 

&gt;##Anything else you want to add?

&gt;&gt;**u/Ohmstar**  Support your local independent book and comic book retailers. Check out Wonder Woman bi-monthly from DC Comics. Preorder trades/collected editions so the companies know there is interest!

&gt;&gt;**u/Fhtagn-Dazs**  I love Diana because her comics have got me through literal years of illness. I don't have the best health, and there have been many times when her strength and ability to stay kind despite the odds and keep going have inspired me to do the same. The fact that her movie was so good meant the absolute world to me. It is cliché, but it's the truth.

I feel like the journalism field is terribly triggering for my CPTSD due to its high intensity nature. It’s extremely cutthroat and competitive (I did an internship at a newsroom so I did get a taste of it first-hand). From the start to the end of the day you do not rest for a minute if you want to be the best. Getting through it involves a lot of coffee, cigarettes and on off time booze. I remember at one point in the year, we had a catch-up week for those falling behind. Myself and the other high-achievers were talking about how anxious it was making them, having nothing to do. It felt like a trick and that in reality their entire career was about to crumble, all because for 5 days they just weren’t *on*. My hands were shaking and I could see theirs were too. 

ANYWAY, apologies for the rant. My point is, I’m worried I won’t be able handle it but it’s pretty much the only thing I’m good at, lol. Really though I would love to hear what careers some of you enjoy, or find relaxed/easy to handle and pays enough to support you.

96qao4,34,2018-08-12,Want to study abroad in China? Programs to avoid,Chineselangthrowaway,ChineseLanguage,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChineseLanguage/comments/96qao4/want_to_study_abroad_in_china_programs_to_avoid/,"A common question on this forum comes from students asking whether or not they should study abroad in China. Of course, most of the time it's a great decision to go abroad and immerse yourself in the language. 

China, however, presents some unique problems to studying abroad and I wanted to write this post now having been on the other side of the process. There are a lot of shady/bad programs out there, and students should really try to do their due diligence before committing to any one program. 

One of the main problems with these Chinese study abroad programs come from what I call 3rd party education providers. These are institutions like ICES, CIEE, ICLCC, and a number of other 'international education' providers. 

Essentially how these institutions operate is that they will gather up a group of Chinese teachers and string together a curriculum before approaching a Chinese university. In exchange for a large cut of the inflated tuition costs, the Chinese host university will allow the organization to use their branding and some of their on-campus facilities. These programs will always list the university name along with another logo/brand name, see [this picture](https://imgur.com/ug3V3JE) for an example. [Here](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/cllen/2129/index.html) is Tinsghua University's department of Chinese Language and Literature. [Here is a completely separate program](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/iclccen/3417/index.html) by the International Chinese Language &amp; Culture Center. With the second program, you will not be given the opportunity to take classes with other Tsinghua university students. 

There are several problems with programs organized in this way: 

1) They operate completely separately from the rest of the university, meaning you will not have the opportunity to take classes or interact with any of the local students. [Here is a picture from Donghua University's website](https://imgur.com/BnmVRzf), which shows how the program is separated from all of the other programs at the school. 

2) Because the programs are technically separated from the actual institution, (i.e., the ICES Fudan program shown in the first picture is not actually a part of Fudan university at all), the education is likely to be poor quality. The teachers that you will have will likely not be actual teachers of the host institution. 

To illustrate what I mean, while I was studying at Tsinghua university as an exchange student, Tsinghua was also running some of these international exchange programs. Whereas I was taking courses with official Tsinghua university professors with real Tsinghua university classmates, the foreigners in the aforementioned programs all took classes together in a separate building with non-Tsinghua professors. They had virtually no opportunity to interact with the local student population. Because I was a ""real"" Tsinghua student, I was allowed to enroll in a course taught by Peter Thiel with a bunch of other Tsinghua students and it was one of the highlights of my study abroad. Essentially, by being separated from the host intitution, these programs take away all of the value of studying at these prestigious institutions in the first place. 

3) These programs also tend to hold you hostage. Because you are not considered a ""real"" student under the host institution, you will have no control over your class schedule. These programs often schedule classes every day Mon-Friday in the middle of the day with the express purpose of blocking you from doing any other activities. A normal exchange student would be able to pick and choose courses at their will, and could create their schedule around an internship or other opportunity. With these programs, you will be forced to sit through the 4 hours/week of 听力 class listening to awful audio recordings, and there's nothing you can do about it. 

In summary, the programs provided by these 3rd party institutions suck away almost all of the value of a study abroad. They love to brand themselves with prestigious universities so that they can charge you inflated tuition prices while you get second-rate education. If you're thinking about studying abroad in China, my advice is to steer clear from these programs and make sure that you are actually applying to the host university and not a 3rd party program using the host university's branding. You will have a much more enjoyable and valuable experience that way. "
96qbvq,8,2018-08-12,New to Front Desk. Lots of Red Flags at my job. Please Advice?,Spam-The-Ham,askhotels,https://www.reddit.com/r/askhotels/comments/96qbvq/new_to_front_desk_lots_of_red_flags_at_my_job/,"Hello ~  Im not sure if this thread is appropriate but I do need some advice. I have experience in accounts and customer services. I recently joined a huge hotel chain at the front desk because it really appealed to me, but there’s a lot of red flags. I started under two months ago, and staff are telling me this is normal. I feel like it’s not.

1. Work hours are terrible. Im prepared for long hours. BUT. Im not paid for going OT on a daily basis. (Even though I am new and I understand that I am slow). I work 9-6:30, I’m not done closings cashier until past 7. Basically I can’t go in until the next person arrives to even close my money box, even if we are busy and they are late. (I also wear heels at work, and don’t sit for almost the entire time). 

2. Pay is terrible. Post taxes/retirement fund etc, I average 7 USD per hour (no I don’t work in the states). So our money has to come from up-selling which is hard in a full hotel. [Which is fine. I get it and is in my contract. Need to mention I was expecting a pay cut when I signed up for this job. However the problem is that] OT has to be approved; if you don’t finish on time its just the way things are. I asked my friend, she thinks that you closing your cashier isn't really part of your paid shift. [Also this relates to point #10 later.]

3. I cry after I come home from work usually. The stress is a lot [given that I live in a popular city], and I’m expected to be able to learn at a fast pace, plus a steep learning curve. [Should have mentioned that I am prepared to learn, but] I have so much fear from this job alone. I don't care when i enter work.

4. I don’t fit in at work. I am usually a sociable person. BUT. Everyone usually speaks Chinese and when I ask about what they are discussing, people usually wave me off and say not to worry. (English is our Primary Language) I think it pays to know what’s going on at the front desk. Also I’m not a social media person, so most of my commonalities are gone.

5. Stupid high turn over. Due to the timing of the year, a lot of people have been recently hired. We have some interns who leave every couple of months; so MONTHLY turn over. Atm, about 50% of our staff at the Front Desk have been working for 3 months or less, and we are still under staffed/people are leaving. [I understand high turnover, but is THIS high normal?] 

6. Im not a fan of management. My managers do their job well, don’t get me wrong. But, some of their handling just makes me question things. E.g. they yelled at my friend (who is also new) in front of the entire back office for her mistake, instead of taking her back to discuss it. Im not sure how to make an effort with them but I also I feel like they just don't make the effort with me unless im doing something wrong.

7. I don’t find management very encouraging. I want to i improve and Im usually good at taking criticism. But I get ‘told’ on what to improve more than encouraged. E.g I panic a bit because Im so nervous, so I need to fix that. Despite best efforts on working on it, Ive also been told: “Don’t forget you’re still on your probation period. Later, things will be difficult for us, If you don’t improve.” I didn’t think that was very encouraging. 

8. I don't fit 'the look'. Just so many things that Im told that I need to improve on. e.g My hair has too much volume (I have short slightly wavy asian hair) so I’m expected to ‘fix it’ despite using a stupid amount of gel and hairspray. I should wear contacts because apparently Im not as pretty in glasses etc. Pain in ass but I get it. The icing on the cake is when I was told that the way I speak is ‘too polite’ and I need to fix it by choosing my words carefully. (I have a clear American accent by the way). So I need to speak LESS politely. Which is pretty ridiculous. [As one Redditor mentioned, I go into work worried if I look and behave like a model.]

9. Don’t get my roster until Sunday night. [Like I literally don't know my work week until the night before I start.] We can’t choose our shifts [which I understood when I signed up for the job. It just makes it hard if you're getting your roster last-minute plus not being able to choose your shift]. Either, so theres no regular work-life balance. So its hard planning my life, unless I ask for days off. ~~I also have no sleeping pattern, which I assume is normal in this industry?~~ [I've worked in restaurants alot, so getting used to this.]

10. The real alarm bell: We have a membership program that we need to enrol people in. Majority of our guests are already members so it’s really hard. Some times we forget to ask, but we are understaffed and often push 95% occupancy. At first, manager started encouraging us, saying that our pay raise depended on it. (Ie we don’t get raises if we don’t meet it). Not much changed. Then one of my seniors above me (but below my boss) started implementing a ‘coin jar’ where if we are caught not getting people to join, we HAVE to put a dollar into this jar. Managers know whats going on but didn't say anything. It’s shit. I got called out, and I thought you’re kidding right? They weren’t. In the end it wasn’t me who forgot, but it’s still shit.

I get that I’m new. But I feel like Im seeing red flags. Please tell me if I am crazy. Career advancement is good in this company, and I'm willing to put in the hard work if its reasonable and paid. Hence I don’t want to just give it up. Nor do I want to quit too soon. I feel very disappointed, since I was looking forward to this role. Im at work for about 50+ hrs a week, But its causing me to [unnecessarily and unfairly] lose time with family. 


TL;DR: Want to quit my front desk job that I was excited about joining. Red flags everywhere. The work is interesting, but not enjoying this actual work environment. Sorry for the long post.

----------------------
Edit: Thank you for the replies! I wrote this on my phone, so I apologise if I sound like a spoon-fed baby. I should have read over it again. I think I need to mention that I was prepared for the hard work and crap that this industry has, but the last thing that I wanted was to be taken advantage of. I study my notes at home, and watch youtube on the systems when i need to.

Made lots of edits, apologies for formatting. These things are the main issues I had, but I did notice other smaller things that I havent mentioned here ofc. "
96qy5c,2,2018-08-12,Research? (general and CS specific questions),pamann42,UVA,https://www.reddit.com/r/UVA/comments/96qy5c/research_general_and_cs_specific_questions/,"Hi!

Background on me and my specific situation (feel free to skip lol)

So I'm a rising first year (sorry lol every post is from a clueless rising first year rn) and I'm hoping to do research at some point in my college career, preferably during the school year because I'd like to pursue internships during the summer. I'm doing a CS and math double major in A&amp;S, and I think it'd be pretty hard to contribute to math research at such an early stage in my math education, but I have a good amount of experience in CS already and could potentially be useful or at least understand the work that the lab is doing.  For some context, I've been interning the past 2 years at a mostly front-end software company (occasionally some full stack stuff, but I never really worked on it) and have had a good amount of experience with the Angular and React frameworks working on decently complex production level apps.

General research questions:

Did you get paid?

When did you start emailing/reaching out to professors and how many labs did you reach out to?

What types of things would they ask to see? Transcript, previous work, etc? Obviously as a first year there isn't too much I can show them.

How much of a time commitment was it?

How hard was your class workload while you were doing research? Was it overwhelming?

CS specific questions:

What type of work were you doing in the lab?

How much prior knowledge did you have on the research topic coming in? How much did they expect you had?

Was getting into a lab pretty competitive?

Did you work in the lab or remotely (assuming you were doing code)?

Thanks!"

I'm considering transferring to GMU as a junior CS major from a large out-of-state school.  Are there many opportunities to excel at GMU, and what kind of internships have you or your friends been able to do?  For reference, I have interned at Lockheed Martin and JPMorgan the past two summers and enjoyed my time at both places, but I'm looking to go to Microsoft, Google, Capital One, etc. this coming year.

I have been a longtime lurker and I have learned a lot from this subreddit! I am currently a student going into my second last year of university and may be doing a year long internship after this year. 

I have managed to save $20K in savings and currently getting 1.25% annual interest on that from my bank. Although it is better than nothing, I was wondering if any of you have any better ideas? I live with my parents and I give them $300/month to help with the bills.  Upon graduation I will have about $30K in interest free student debt. I am not concerned about the student debt, since I can apply for interest-free status for many months after graduation and I should have enough money for that after my year long internship. Besides that, I have no other debt or fixed expenses. 

I am currently working as a teaching assistant at my University and receiving benefits from a pension plan for a total monthly income of $600/month. 

I have an entrepreneurial spirit and have been contemplating on beginning a startup business. I am majoring in Computer Science and would be able to start an online business, however, I want to hear if there are more reasonable steps I should take.
I am also open to investing  a portion of my savings in stocks, bonds or other financial instruments (even though $20K is not a lot). 

Given my current situation, what should I do with my savings?

96senl,0,2018-08-12,I (21F) have fallen for my internship manager (32M),LDNthrowaway518,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/96senl/i_21f_have_fallen_for_my_internship_manager_32m/,"I am interning this summer at a well known investment management firm this summer, and I cannot tell if I’m misreading my manager, H’s, intentions.

H has kind of been my guide to the firm, and London, all summer. I’m naturally shy so it was really nice to be under the wing of someone so affable and extroverted from the start. I believe one of the reasons he was paired with me was because he is also an American. He has gone above and beyond to make me feel welcome at the firm but I cannot tell if it’s just because of who he is or if he has feelings for me as well. 

He is one of those people that takes the time to make everyone feel special, just by the way he seems to give extreme focus to every little interaction he has. He addresses each of the cleaners by name and asks about their kids if we are working past 10pm. Even if he’s busy, he makes time. He gets gifts for people around the office, everyone from the secretary and the cleaners to the head of the Europe - always getting little toys or figurines (travels a lot for work through the week). He is the guy that all of the PAs swoon over because in addition to being really kind and social, he is tall, athletic, tan and has a great set of teeth. He is also very unpretentious compared to a lot of typical “finance bros”.

During my internship he had included me in a dinner with one of the cofounders of the company, taken me to client meetings that I never thought I would get a chance to partake in, and made sure that I was invited to all of the afterwork lad drinks. While I believe that is him being just a good internship buddy, the next bit is what confuses me. He takes me to dinner/drinks if we finish up late, where he pays on a non-company card. There is a lot of talk about work and him encouraging me, but I really feel like it’s a date by the way he gets my chair, fills my wine for me, guides me along my drink selection, etc. He has also asked me if I wanted to join him to social events with his friends over the weekend, although I think it’s in large part to me not having a friend grou here. Also, he had asked how I would feel about “accompanying” him to black tie charity event a few weeks ago.

So I’m stuck here not knowing what to do. I don’t know if I have just idealized him at this point and just feel this way because I’ve misread how he acts towards me. He might be treating me nicely because my family has made investments into the fund. I’m just a plain looking girl compared some of the girls I’ve seen him date. I’m finishing up my internship in two weeks and don’t know how to tell him how I feel about him.

I should note that I cannot work for the company right after I graduate, so there’s no offer at stake. They only hire people after doing a stint in banking or consulting.

Tl;dr - I think I’m in love with my internship manager/direct report, and don’t know how to cross the bridge before I fly back to the US in a few weeks."
96smvr,2,2018-08-12,[F4F] Exhibit C,Jilling_Time,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/96smvr/f4f_exhibit_c/,"""Hello everyone! My name is Natalie, and I'll be your tour guide this evening."" Oh great, *Natalie* was here tonight. Not that she was bad or anything, quite the opposite. She just knew so much about the exhibits that the guests would be spending far more time than usual at each one. ""If you look over to your right, you'll see our first exhibit here, the disobedient maid."" There were a lot of *oohs* and *aahs* from the crowd, as well as the sound of pictures being taken. I couldn't see from my current position, but I knew it by heart. It was a woman wearing a sexy french maid outfit entirely made of latex, with her hands bound behind her back and a feather duster sticking out of her mouth. ""As you can see here,"" Natalie went on, ""Alice here has been very naughty lately."" It was bullshit. It was just the shift she'd been asked to work. And honestly, she wasn't even the one that drew the short straw. ""Alice is stuck in this enclosure until she dusts off every single item in that room."" Typically there was a full bookshelf, a table with some ornaments, and a leather chair. A couple of times per evening the maid would ""accidentally"" knock over a chalice or decoration from the table, though sometimes it was deliberate. The crowd loved it anyway, looking on from the other side of the giant glass window.

Sure enough, Natalie spent ages answering stupid questions from the guests. Honestly, I just wanted them to move on. Eventually she did, although the next part was just as bad. ""Moving on, exhibit B here is known as the playpen."" I still couldn't see them, but I could hear the squeak of rubber and their (partially) exaggerated pants. There would be two girls in there, trussed up in latex bitchsuits that kept them down on all fours. I wasn't sure who it was tonight, but I knew they were both wearing ring gags that kept their tongues hanging out. Once again, the crowd cheered and took plenty of pictures. I knew the only exposed bits were their pussies and their tits, so their mouths would be busy tonight. The biggest variable was whether or not they were blindfolded or if someone had been given a strapon. Once again, Natalie took her sweet time speaking with all of the guests.

""Finally, we have the last exhibit in our tour tonight. And this one's a rather special one."" I gulped. I had been waiting for this for a while now, but I was still nervous. Not that there was much I could do anyway. ""Exhibit C, also called the decoration, is a personal favourite of mine."" That part was actually true. While Natalie spent plenty of time at all the Exhibits, this was one where she always got personal. ""Yes, there is actually a woman inside underneath all that."" I couldn't see the crowd, but I could feel them staring up at the wall. I was fully encased in a vacuum sealed latex prison, unable to move a muscle. My outline could be clearly seen by anyone. Despite the fact that my face was fully covered, I had a ball gag and blindfold underneath my bondage. ""As you can see here, this is one of our interactive exhibits."" Natalie pressed a button, and the dildo in my cunt started slowly vibrating. I screamed into my gag and writhed in place, much to the amusement of the crowd. My buttplug stayed still, so she must be saving that one for later. ""Don't worry,"" she told the crowd, ""you'll all get a chance to use the remote. Also, unlike the last ones, this is a hands on exhibit. You're welcome to get up there and feel any part you like."" I let out a groan at this point, both from pleasure and annoyance. It was going to be a long night.

I never should've taken an internship at the fetish festival.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hi everyone, thanks for reading through that massive wall of text. As you can tell, I'm looking to be a toy for others to play with tonight. If you want I can be in one of the other exhibits, or if you have any new ideas, please let me know! You're welcome to be the tour guide, the people in the crowd, or the manager coming down to see how things are. Who knows, maybe you can be another attraction that gets to interact with the other exhibits?

If your a fan of latex, hard bondage, public, and orgasm control, send me a message. My limits are incest, scat, beast, and underage. Pretty much everything else is on the table. I look forward to getting some orange envelopes."

I know basic algorithm for machine learning, without having had the opportunity to apply much of it in my current internship or during school.

I saved up about $8000 over the summer, and now need to go back to school. 

My school is under a scholarship, and i get about $800 per semester.

Now my car is stalling on the road, and i brought it to 3 mechanics and none can figure out the issue. This is very dangerous, since I lose all power and power steering randomly , plus I drive on the interstate frequently.

So I am thinking I can get about $1.5k for my car , currently I do not have collision or comprehensive so my insurance is around $150/ month however if i get a different car over $6k, i would need those so my insurance would jump to $300/month

My rent , internet, water, electricity comes out to around $400/month
I will make about $300 a month working a part time job.

Here are the options I was thinking. 

1. Buy a ~11,000 reliable, lightly used car (2013 mazda 3) finance for $8000 at 4% for 5 years and put 3k down. 
2. Lease a car for 3 years, like a Honda civic at ~ 200 month + 2000 down 
3. Buy a cheap car ~ 6000 and hope it does not break.

I was leaning more towards the lease, since I expect my income to be about $75,000 after I graduate, so I could then just trade in the car and not have to worry about breaking down in college. Plus I expect to buy a different car after college. I also drive only about 9k miles a year.

any advice on what option I should pick would be great!"

This may include, forcing you to behave like a dog, insults to your appearance, marking you body with words like ""slut, cumdump, etc"", making you crawl around nude in public (on a leash of course), walking around with a vibrator, and more.

For prompts I'm open to any ideas you may have or one of the following:

Professor: You come to my office for help, but all that happens is that I degrade you and your race, hopefully to the point of tears. I then other you an opportunity, do as I say and you might be able to pass the class after all. In reality you'll end up covered in cum (maybe spit and piss as well) and put up on display in the quad.

Boss: Your an intern that somehow got hired at my company. This one I have a few ideas on how it plays out. I could call you to my office and threaten to fire you, unless you do as i say. Or your at the office while no one else is and i force myself on you. Both end with you being the office fucktoy/(Toilet)

Also with the internship option, is it possible to complete your internship during the summer time, or is it randomly chosen for you when you can complete your internship.

Lastly, just in general how is the city of St John's? I currently am in a pretty large city (Toronto) and dislike the feel of such a large city, would St John's have a different feel from this kind of city, is the community close together, and is there a solid student life/nightlife?

I chose an easier major than my peers in the field of computer science (BA instead of BS). For two years, I've been working hard at college, but I cut myself from a social life and wallowed in self-pity. Even when I had the chance to join clubs, I chose not to extend myself. Now, my next semester is going to be very difficult (linear algebra), and I am scared as hell. 2 years ago I struggled with Calc 2, and I barely remember it. I am so scared of failing again, as I did not receive a return offer from a summer internship. Yet I want to try this out. This will put me on the same plane as my peers. I am gearing up, but this (linear algebra) will be a challenge for me. I am always so anxious, lost, and nervous. I tell myself, over and over again, that I will fail and cannot do work. This is due to some bad academic experiences my first 2 years of school, but they haunt me. Math is not my ""natural"" subject, but I feel like failure is something I should no longer fear. How do I get out of this mental ghetto of perceived inadequacy and start challenging myself?"

This is my first time posting here so please forgive me if I'm not doing something right here. I just really could use some advice from people who maybe have gone through a similar experience as mine. I discovered this community through a podcast I listen to, Stuff Mom Never Told You, on their episode about being the child of narcissists.

Anyways... Any help or advice you guys could offer me would be immensely appreciated. WARNING- I want to be as comprehensive as possible, so this is gonna be a long one. However, I'd be eternally grateful for anyone who takes the time to read this and help out in any way.

So I am 22 years old, freshly graduated from college and just at the cusp of an engineering career at an awesome company working on really unique and interesting projects. I grew up in Florida and just moved out to New Mexico for the job. This is what I tell people. However, a big (and more personal) reason I moved out here was to escape my narcissistic train wrecks of parents. There has been a long track record of turmoil, abuse, and just general fucked-upness in my immediate family, and I had to work incredibly hard throughout school and in my personal life to carve out my own path, heal myself from/process the trauma, and separate from my dark past. However, though right now I feel like I'm out of the woods, I worry constantly for the well being of my 13 year old sister (who currently lives with my dad) and I am perpetually wishing that I could do more to help her out. I feel like a weird version of survivors guilt...

So a little more on the backstory:

My parents had an extremely unhealthy relationship, riddled with narcissistic abuse, manipulation, and addiction to alcohol and other drugs. They had a pretty nasty divorce when I was about 12, but I knew even then that it was better that they were apart. It was scary. When my parents got divorced, my little sister and I went to live with our mother. She was absolutely horrendous to us. She would physically and emotionally abuse us, and pass out on painkillers and Xanax for days at a time, leaving me (the oldest) to take care of the younger kids by myself- on top of juggling an advanced and demanding high school curriculum (though I was smart enough for these classes, my NMom refused to have a daughter who was in the ""stupid"" classes. She was very performance oriented though rarely gave any kind of positive reinforcenent). 

I remember one day in particular, I was a freshman in high school and I had missed the bus while my mom was still asleep. I knew that she had wanted me to skip school that day solely for the purpose of ""helping her out and watching the kids. She has no one else and it's just so hard!!"" I couldn't stand the thought of this, so I walked to school from my house. It was about 3 miles and I showed up to school an hour late. Despite all that, when my mom woke up and found out that I had went to school anyway, she blew up my phone with nasty texts and phone calls telling me to LITERALLY get up and walk out of class, and walk the 3 miles back home to ""help her"". This anecdote I guess shows the kind of person my mom is. She also attached a lock to the OUTSIDE of my little sister's door (she was kindergarten-age) to keep her in her own room for extended amounts of time. My little sister has recently spoken to me with tears about the physical abuse my mother put her through- she vividly recalled how my mom got mad and smashed her head through a wall in her bedroom, then casually covered the hole with a calendar. Looking back, it's sickening because as kids we totally normalized (and internalized!!) how fucked up our mom was as a person. 

During this time, my escapism was my schoolwork. It was constructive and when I was studying I wasn't thinking about other things like the chaos around me. I think it also helped me survive my mom's constant self-gratifying push for me to be a star student (only for the purpose of making HER look like an awesome mom...)

Anyways, when I was 16 my mother took her batshit crazy to another level. She was on the verge of being left by her second husband, and in reaction to this she left home the Saturday before Thanksgiving with my half-sister (a baby at the time), left me and my little sister at home alone, and threatened to kill herself and the baby. She left home without telling us where she went or if she would be back at all. She made phone calls to my stepdad, along with nearly all her friends and family, saying she was going to kill herself and she was taking the baby with her. Finally someone called the cops on her. They found her and the baby, and she was Baker Acted (committed to a mental hospital for 72hrs for threats of suicide). Child services came to take us away from her. My father, who I was very much estranged from at the time, came and picked me and my sister up that night and we brought one backpack each of things we cared about most. This was the last time I have ever seen my mom or talked to her since I testified against her in court for my sisters sake a year ago. Her and I are completely no contact and she's essentially dead to me.

After we left our mom, suddenly we found ourselves in an unfamiliar environment with a fairly unfamiliar parent, but he wasn't threatening to kill us or beating on us so life was at least better for us in that respect. In high school, though I truly didn't understand it at the time, my dad was narcissistic towards my sister and I in his own special way. Though he was now respinsible for two kids, and I believe he truly did the best he could (but just didn't know any better), he couldn't drop the single guy party life that he had adapted post-divorce. He used to bring strange women over on school nights, get trashy girlfriends from strip clubs, stay up until 2AM playing extremely loud guitar the night before I had a calculus exam (then yelled at me IT WAS HIS HOUSE AND IF I DIDN'T LIKE IT I COULD GTFO when I complained to him about the noise) , and struggled with a drinking/ drug problem.

Two years into living with him, my dad was arrested for possession of cocaine. My sister and I (I was 2 months away from being 18) were removed from our home yet again by child services, and became just a hair away from being put into the foster care system. Luckily our maternal grandmother bailed my dad out of jail and picked me and my sister up from the child services office before we got sent off to a foster home.

With my dad, while I was living with him, I was always the ""responsible one"". I wrote grocery lists, reminded him of due dates, and helped take care of my sis. To me it feels like his brain never grew up past 16 (maybe it's because of the drugs. Who knows.) He is extremely irresponsible and is addicted to the thrill of living on the seat of his pants. I wouldn't really give a crap if that's how he wanted to live his life as an individual, but when kids are depending on you.. It's like come on man. He always has these ridiculous dreams of becoming a rock star and living this fast life. He views himself as this godly figure who may mess up but always is in the right. He kind of gets a kick off of being in control.

As I left home to go to college, I started to become more aware of my dad's own narcissism. I realize now that he embraces the classic NParent Golden Child vs. Scapegoat dynamic... Where I'm the Golden Child, the one who ""made it"", the smart one, the one who reminds him of himself if he actually tried in school. My sister, unfortunately, has been the scapegoat. It pains me that she has to go through such blatant favoritism and I hate that it ""works out in my favor"" because it's just not fair. My sister is nearly a spitting image of our mom, and much less of a people pleaser than I am (she will actually talk back to my dad when he's being unfair or irrational while my survival tactic was to just be good and obedient). Thus, I notice my dad is extremely resentful towards her and frankly treats her like crap.

It has gotten worse since I have left home/the state and start to forge a life of my own rather than being the one who always cleans up after the messes my dad makes. I care about her a lot, and she is so mature and precocious for her age. I see boundless potential in her, a beauty and a fiery passion and a lovely sense of curiosity and intrigue. However I fear for how she's being treated by my dad.

What has helped me get through some really fucking tough times is telling myself that I'm her rock. I'm her example in life- I want to show her that even if our parents are shitty, there is light at the end of the tunnel if she just focuses on the positive and constructive things in life. I call her AT LEAST once a week and we talk on the phone for hours. To me it's how I can give her a sense of hope and self esteem and motivation- to cheer her on even if she's getting trampled on in middle school and called a dumbass and a turd and whatever else my dad says to her at home. 

She's such an awesome kid and I can't emphasize how much I freaking love her. I think this is the same love a person feels when they have kids of their own... She has told me that she loves that she can talk to me about anything at all and I understand. How can I not? Her and I have been through the same crazy shit together.  If I had an older girl when I was her age to tell me everything was going to be ok, it would have made my life a lot easier. So that's what I want to be for her.

Anyways. We were supposed to talk today (we talk every Sunday). But she never called. My dad had sent me a passive agressive text this morning (communication between him and I has devolved to only this- after he harassed me and tried to guilt trip me for money I had earned at my internship last summer WHICH I WAS USING TO PAY FOR MY LAST YEAR OF MY BACHELORS DEGREE, him and I never really recovered and I honestly have no respect left for this man- between that and all the crap he puts my sis through). I checked my email this afternoon and saw she had sent me something. I knew this probably meant he took her phone away. Her message was short and frantic- sent around the time when my dad had texted me this morning. She asked me not to call her because dad would get mad and do something to her. And that she loved me. I asked her if she was okay, and I reassured her that I'm here if she needs anything. 

She responded a few hours later and told me that my dad woke her up at 5am, yelled at her to wash dishes and choked her (wtf???). I was appalled and enraged and disgusted. My dad had spent so many years proclaiming righteously that he would never stoop to the level of my mom- yet here he was being EXACTLY like her. It makes me sick to my stomach. I don't know what to do. I'm thousands of miles away from my sister and my dad, which I did to save myself, but I desperately wish that I could bring her with me and save her too. She starts the eighth grade tomorrow and I can't believe that she has to put up with this bullshit from my dad too. I told her that she should reach out to adults she trusts at school-a teacher a counselor SOMEBODY. I don't know how much this will actually help but this was what I was always told to do in abusive situations and I truly didn't know what else to say. :(

I just don't know what else to do. I am so angry that I seriously considered just calling the cops on my dad and getting him locked up for being such an abusive piece of crap to this poor innocent girl. But I was scared that he would take it out on her, or that she would end up in a foster home or somehow back at my mom's.

I guess my question to you guys is- why I'm reaching out- what the hell can I do from my position as a 22 year old escapee from narcissistic parents to save my little sister from my dad, who is truly being downright rotten to her, and to keep her away from our mom (who is even more unstable than dad) and out of the foster system??? 

I feel like at this point in her life she is at a formative crossroads where all it takes is one fuck up from my dad (he ends up in jail again, or beats her or says something totally off the wall to her) for her to end up on the wrong path in life. She is such an amazing kid and I want to help her. But I'm not sure how. I am so incredibly happy that I worked my way through my shitty experiences as a kid to become my own person as an adult but I feel like I'm not finished yet- that I've left her behind. I want her with me and for her to feel happy and safe and free and be able to self-actualize and have a normal childhood.... I'm trying really hard to keep it together and not break down and cry about it or call my dad up and just cuss him out (but I know that wouldn't help AT ALL).

Thank you again for taking the time to read this. It truly means a lot. Sorry for the freaking novel, but I felt like it was important to provide the broader context behind what happened today, and also it just felt cathartic to type it all out.

Much love--

Let's start off with I love my friends. They're wonderful people who care deeply about me even though we met like 3 months ago, and everyone is starting to leave because we're just here on an internship. Which makes me feel even shittier about my shittiness. 

My bulemic bestie, who knew about me and was wonderful to talk to when I really needed someone left last week. Then another bestie who understood the ridiculous drama I'm going through with my boyfriend/fiance/ex left on Friday, so I've been struggling there too. 

I went to the fitness guy at work on Monday. 21% body fat. ""Ideal"" or ""athlete"" lol. Talked to him about intending to tone up a bit and he went on a rant about what bf% you lose your period at. Then he told me I should be eating 2000-2200 Cal/day for maintenance. Lol. It's more like 1600 you liar. 

Then I've been eating a lot recently. I've been eating at maintenance for like 4 days and I feel like a fucking whale. 

I turned 23 on Thursday, and Wednesday night I just felt so shitty. I ""binged"" (I don't think it could be considered actual binging, but as a primarily Ana girl, it felt like it), then I purged because I wasn't okay with eating at maintenance. I've only purged a few times, and this was def the best yet. But then I didn't feel much better after. I still felt like a fat fucking whale and wanted to get rid of more. But I keep fucking eating because my stupid friends and family make me feel so cared about that I feel like I need to take care of myself specifically for them. It works pretty well because my FWB and I hang out most of the time, and he means a lot to me. I hate disappointing him. 

After my fitness appointment, I told my FWB about my body comp results (he knows about my eating issues, and he's generally really sweet, even though he really doesn't know what to do with the information) and whatever, and he told me he thought he was similar (I know that men have lower bf% than women, but it still bothered me because of how he talks about himself). Then this morning he told me this morning how fucking fat he felt while we were... not entirely clothed. 

Than we had a good day, are good brunch, drank quite a bit, chilled like pros. But then he decided to play some sad music, and my body decided to cry. Then I collected myself, but he kept playing sad music and I just died. I sobbed in his bathroom, he noticed and came in and gave me hugs until I felt better. 

Then we get to the bar, and it's really fun, but one of my friends snaps me to make sure I'm okay, and I'm not, so I go to cry in the bathroom a couple more times because she's so nice and totally understands my triggers, even though she doesn't know about my reactions. 

So now I just feel like shit. My friends are wonderful, and they don't understand, and everything in my life is falling apart, but I'm trying so fucking hard for them. They are so worth maintenance for, but we're all leaving on this weekend and I'm terrified of letting them down. 

Just needed to vent. Thank you for listening, sorry if it doesn't make sense. "
96vjb9,9,2018-08-13,How to stop family to blame every bad thing on the fact that I am trans?,foxy1604,asktransgender,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/96vjb9/how_to_stop_family_to_blame_every_bad_thing_on/,"Hi everyone,

Yesterday I was at a birthday just doing birthday things like sipping on drinks and sometimes idly chatting with people I haven't seen in a while.

Since coming out I dont really like birthdays because I dont really have much in common with the rest of the family and especially becuase they always say that they are supportive but then lash out with things like ""If you want to become a woman you *have* to paint your toenails and wear dresses every time"".. They even call this helping me(!?!?)

So i try to keep myself out of their reach and minds and talk to the people who you rarely see on regular birthdays. Which usually works..

But this time the usual members of my family wanted to ""help me"" again so they decided they wanted to go through every little detail about my past struggles. 

Why i had so hard time getting a internship, getting a room for that internship I found (and love because i get to work with someone who's  work i really really love and admire) and so on..

What shocked me was that for them it was really simple. They just grabbed a imaginary big red stamp and put accross all of these things **`BECAUSE YOU'RE TRANSGENDER`**

Which made me defend in return saying that i was sometimes just really unlucky and sometimes i just was really late to apply for a internship and there where lots of other people who also apply'd. 

And yes, a couple of people may got spooked by my voice which made me recognise that I should work on that and I am now following sessions to make my voice appear more feminine which in return has given me a big boost of convidence because i now can go and have a conversation with people who dont know me and talking in a dressing room with friends gotten a *lot* les awkward.

But anyway, they just waved these things away and came up with ridiculouss idea's that i would go to these intership meetings half naked, obviously in a skirt or dress (even though because of their obsession about this i never wear one on birthday party's just to avoid moments like these.) , wearing drag-like makeup, and so on and so on..

At every argument they gave like the skirt and dress one, I turned it down and said that i always was wearing a pair of pants and something nice on top.

But they kept coming on and on about it until i was on the verge of tears and denial and screamed that I dont want do talk about it anymore.

Which in turn made it only worse because they felt like they where **`HELPING`** and got mad about it.

Now that you know the story, how can i prevent things like this? 

I have talked with my psychiatrist about this and she asked why I even would go to these *party's* but the thing is, my family has a really lovin and warm connection with each other and a part of me just wants this to.

But to be honest, as for transgender things they only want to hear their side. As soon as i talk excited about my operation they all stare blankly away from me so i almost never talk about that. They dont even want to hear that i just celebrated my year on hrt and how great of a year it was.

If you read this you probably think *Just leave them alone* but i just want their loving warmth  connection without the **`HELPING`** so does anyone have a idea on how to prevent moments like this??"

Constant positive feedback from top-leadership in company, but young &amp; stupid.",DJFourfire,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/96vpsc/am_i_worth_more_constant_positive_feedback_from/,"Late post, but currently I work in a marketing job for a very large hospitality company with multiple properties. In essence, although this isn't my dream job, per say, it's a fantastic stepping stone in a company I've wanted to work for for a very long time. Plus, I love going to work every day.

I came in as an intern, and I've constantly received positive feedback from both of my supervisors at how they've been looking for someone like me for quite a while. One has been there for 20+ years, the other for 30 years. Besides those two, I'm the third part of our department. Our VP of Marketing and President of the company constantly compliment me on my knowledge and work-ethic.

Here's the deal: I'm currently making $16/hr. Avg. salary nationwide for my line of work is $22/hr. I work full-time, so my pay usually comes out to $2100 each month. Keep in mind, I'm a recent college grad and have no experience with the sort of marketing I'm working in. Although I have a marketing degree, I've had to learn almost everything. However, I've brought countless skills to the table (graphic design, computer knowledge, etc.) that's saved us thousands of dollars in outside fees. 

The nature of my job requires me to be on call 24/7 unless I'm on vacation, but I can receive overtime. Last week, I worked a shift from 8:30 AM to 5:30 AM. Other times, I work a normal, 40-hour work week.

My internship began over a year ago, and I've assumed the full-time role since January. 

What's the best move here? "

| 4 | T2: 1:53 |  
| 5 | Run: 28:22 (8:55 per mile) |  


\### Training  
I was honestly not training thaaaat hard for this race.  It was the end of the summer and I wanted to have a strong race going into the school year, but my long commute to my internship really threw my training schedule off.  I particularly neglected my bicycling.  I was training on a bike too big for me (I rode on a 58 cm while I need a 54 cm) since I didn't have a bike in New Jersey and was borrowing it for the summer from a friend.  More on that later, bit it really messed with me both in training and on race day

\### Pre-race  
The gun went off at 7:00 and transition opened at 5:00.  I arrived at 5:05 am and there were already several hundred cars in the lot (even though parking opened at 4:45).  There were lots of people helping doing packet pickup so there was no line at all, and I was into transition by 5:25.  There were reports that there might be rain the day of, but it was only a bit cloudy.  Transition was in a big grass field, easy to set up, no complaints.  Before the race, they had us seed ourselves based on our swim time.  My only complaint is that the staging area before the swim start had sharp asphalt, so it was very painful after just a few minutes.  You had to kind of wade into the water, which was ehh, whatever, I just hit my knee on something underwater on the way in, but no big deal.  Right before, I also realized i had forgotten my water bottle in the car.  I told my mom who was watching to try to buy one and hand it to me coming out of the water (more on that later)


\### Swim

Boy the water was REALLY SALTY.  It was worse than the atlantic usually is (we were in kind of an inlet).  Visibility in the water was complete shit, couldn't see my hands when I had them stretched out.  It was a total scrum in the water, and around 2/3rds of the way through, I got kicked right in the stomach.  I swallowed a TON of saltwater and it made me feel really sick.  Overall I felt pretty good on the swim though, I was a bit slower than my target time, but I felt really comfortable coming out of it so it was OK.

\### T1

I passed at least 4 people coming out of the water, and charged into the transition zone.  I was a bit slow getting my shoes on since I had some trouble with the straps not bucking in right, but it was still OK.  On the way out of T1, before the bike mount, my mother was on the sidelines with a water bottle, but she was too far away to hand it to me.  I stopped and told her to toss it to me, but then decided not to since it might be dangerous.  Only later did I learn this could have gotten me DQ'd so thank god we didn't do that


\### Bike  
The bike course was mostly flat with a few small hills scattered about.  It was here I realized the impact of neglecting my biking.  I was huffing and puffing putting in looooots of effort, and still not really going any faster than those around me.  I went hard the first half, passing a bunch of people, but was gasssed the second half and had to take it easy.  Additionally, the bike being too big was really taking a toll on my core muscles, and I was extremely sore after only about 4 miles (I'd never been this sore in training before, I suspect the massive saltwater intake didn't help).  Now I'm shopping for a proper fitting bike haha.  By the end of the bike I was sore, tired, and very dehydrated.  I felt like total shit, especially because I was being passed fairly often on the 2nd half of the bike.  I was able to usually make up ground on the up/down hills where I could take advantage of getting out of the seat and pushing on the downhills, but I lost ground on the flats.  I almost crashed on the dismount too, so I need to practice that more.

\### T2  
Coming into T2 I felt like total shit.  I wasn't about to give up but boy did I want to right there.  As I was racking my bike a woman was racking hers a few spots down, and knocked the (very expensive) bike of someone else over.  I caught the bike and got her attention as she was pulling away from the rack and we both struggled to get it back on for a solid 20 seconds before it finally settled on there.  My mom was witing at the side of transition and had placed the bottle on the ground inside the transition so that I could pick it up.  I drank a bunch of the water and tossed the bottle down.  I have never been so thankful for water in my life.


\### Run  
Once I got into the run, I was really in my groove.  I was tired but I was maintaining a solid 8:20 ish /mile and passed about 15 people in the first 1.5 miles.  However, at around mile 1.5, there was a SAND SECTION.  Yup, we had to run about 200m in deep sand, with part of it up a steep incline.  My motivation was immediately killed.  I had to walk up the sand incline, and at the top I was about to vomit.  I was a bit angry since (it seemed to me) there was no reason to go through the sand as the run could have easily stayed on the boardwalk.  After the sand, my speed dropped like a rock, and I was probably at 9:30 / mile.  I felt like I was walking.  Towards the end, we had to run up and around a building on a pier (I guess?) and then down the other side of the pier.  That was pretty tough and I cursed that hill as I had to come and do it again in reverse.  By the end, I was about to keel over.  They had an announcer guy who would watch the bib numbers and shout your name and where you were from as you came up to the finish line so that gave me the motivation to finish!  

\### Post-race  
Final time was 1:17:02 which was 7 minutes behind my goal.  I finished 69/200 in the men's division.  I was definitely dissapointed by my time, but I really was hurt by my ignoring the bike.  I was putting in a shitload of effort for what was still a sub-par time.  The lack of water and the saltwater intake didn't help, as well as the mis-fitting bike, so I don't take all the blame lol.  They had some food for the athletes after the race, but I thought all of it tasted like crap to be honest.  I usually lose my appetite after running for some reason (but it came back a few hours later with a vengeance).  Overall, I'm a bit miffed by the time, but now I know a more realistic goal to set for myself for next year, as well as some weakness areas!  

\### What's next?  
No idea!  I'm not fit enough for an olympic distance, but I want to train for that.  But I'll be back next year AC . . . I'll be back"

I was hoping for some advice on how to make my resume a bit more competitive. I'm a career changer and have been working as a lawyer for the last seven years, but I want a career with a more analytical/mathematical focus because that's what I always have been good at and I want to play to my strengths. 

I have passed Exams P and FM but so far I have applied to a handful of places and only gotten a phone interview. I also know some VBA and SQL and am learning R through DataCamp. I will continue to apply but I was hoping for some advice on how to bolster my resume. Should I take Exam MFE in November? Should I focus on my programming/data skills? My contract with my current employer ends at the end of the year so I could also take an internship at that time if it would help.

I moved over here when I was approximately two. During my primary (elementary) school years, I have been called the n-word by classmates multiple times, then made to apologise to said classmate by teachers for threatening to go to the principal. I am of North Indian heritage, and have a fair complexion, but definitely look ""Indian"". 

At my high school, of 250 students in my year, there were only three graduates that went to university. In my final year of high school, the assistant principal advised me to drop out and get a real job as a taxi driver. I knew she was racially stereotyping me, because most of the taxi drivers over here are Indians.

Now, I graduated from university approximately three years ago, but I can tell you even in the upper echelons of the Australian education system, these  people are still racist to their core! Once I overheard a professor speaking with a White student and the professor sarcastically said, ""Only the Asians get As in this course!""  Also, during networking events, the managers and recruiters of big companies will totally ignore anyone who is non-White and only mingle with the Whites.

Here's the kicker - I'm a CS (Computer Science) major, who maintained a relatively good GPA and have an internship with a reputable software company. I have a White friend who has a GPA that is slightly lower than mine and no internship experience. He ended up with a job after just 5 interviews. I got my first job offer after about 15 interviews. I get the same excuse every time: Asians (*They say ""You"" instead of Asian, but I know what they mean...*) don't have the greatest communication skills. I've also been told that I was rejected because because I won't ""Whiten"" my name - they had trouble pronouncing my name which is two syllables. I have a moderate Australian accent and enunciate words quite meticulously.  

Yet, my White Australian friend who doesn't brush his teeth daily and sounds like a bogan (redneck) has amazing interpersonal and communication skills. I know other Asians who are of lighter complexion than me (ie: Austalian-born Chinese/Korean/Vietnamese) experiencing even more discrimination!"

I had work study jobs while in college such as being a tutor. While in college I also tried to get an internship that’ll use my studies, but never had any luck. I currently spend at least 2 hours a day applying to jobs, but never had any luck. I’ve had a few interviews but no job offers. I have no car so I have to use my parents money to go to interviews, which is all wasted since I’ve never gotten an offer. Where I currently live I have no friends so all I do is apply to jobs. My friends live about an hour away from me and ask me to hangout but I don’t have a car and feel bad that I can’t see them. I don’t know what to do at this point. I hate every day because it seems like I made no progress since I finished high school since I have nothing to show for it. I update my resume almost every week with any small detail I can think of and it’s still not good enough. I just want some advice that could help me get a job. "
96waff,128,2018-08-13,For those being threatened by church leadership and trolled by members over Protect LDS Children. Here are a couple of responses you may consider.,madmaxdc,exmormon,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/96waff/for_those_being_threatened_by_church_leadership/,"I've seen several posts talking about people being attacked by family, and ward/stake leadership for Facebook posts regarding [www.protectldschildren.org](https://www.protectldschildren.org) and Sam Young's efforts. Here are a couple of responses.

1. For those threatening disciplinary action:  
""Bishop/Stake President, frequently I am seeing the LDS church publish articles stating that LDS leaders are men who have flaws and often make statements in which they are ""only speaking as men"".  I see the ""worthiness interview policies"" as a flawed position by LDS Leaders and I can only accept that this is one of the cases where they are ""only speaking as men."" Christ was adamant in the scriptures about not harming children. If you are threatening my church membership for speaking up for the safety of our children by making it an issue of ""not supporting the brethren"" then I am willing to stand on the side of Christ. If you feel the need to silence me for supporting our children's safety, then perhaps you should consider whether you are loyal to Christ, or whether you are loyal to church leadership. In this case, you cannot have both.""
2. ""Bishops/Counselors/Stake Presidency need to ask these questions so that they can 'make a diagnosis...you know, kind of like a doctor.""  
""Doctors require 8 to 12 years of  post graduate schooling in order to be licensed for making diagnoses. Licensed clinical therapists require at least a Master's degree in psychology, internships, and experience before becoming LCSTs.  Outside of a a possible few Bishops in that field, they have no training nor certificates, nor degrees in psychological counseling, especially not in dealing with childhood sexual issues.  These men don't know enough to realize when they are causing lifelong trauma to a child by discussing sensitive sexual issues and combining it with both coercive confessions and publicly embarrassing punishments. ~~To grant untrained lay ministry~~ To **require** untrained lay ministry to ask explicit sexual questions and grant unrestricted access in one-on-one interviews, behind closed doors, is a SYSTEMIC failure waiting to happen.  We know these failures have happened ala Joseph Bishop, and through the hundreds of stories on PLDSC website.

96xcsi,1,2018-08-13,Getting Over a Cheater. Help Me.,wlnie12,ExNoContact,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/96xcsi/getting_over_a_cheater_help_me/,"I’ve been in a relationship with this guy for nearly three years. In these past years he has proven to me several times that he is a cheating, lying asshole. And yet, I’m still having a difficult time convincing myself to break up with him. Let me give you some background...

1. I first met him through a dating app during my 3rd year of college and he seemed nice and normal enough. He convinced me to be his girlfriend and we dating for about a month before having a long distance relationship. I go to school in America and he lives in another country (my home country). Every two-three months I would come back to stay with him for a week. I went back every spring, summer, fall, and winter break, saving up my money and spending it all on the tickets (I know, desperate. But he was the first guy I felt like I really connected with and felt that we had so much in common. I would later come to learn that he’s a pathological liar and manipulator.)

2. When I came back to my home country for three weeks during summer break, he would constantly make weird excuses to not see me on the weekends. His family lived in the countryside and he would ‘go home every weekend.’ I knew his parents and had no reason to believe he was lying.

3. I decide to take a leave of semester my first semester of senior year to do an internship in my home country (but mostly to see him more often). He continues to make weird lies and avoid seeing me at times. I think of breaking up with him but can’t convince myself I have a good enough reason.

4. During December of that semester, I find out he has a girlfriend of five years. Everything felt really weird and I felt like I needed to snoop around. I’m waiting for him at his house while he’s out for a bit and log into his computer. He has another girlfriend. I message her and she tells me she’s with him right now and that she’ll come right away. When he arrives she tells me that she’s been meeting him for five years and tells me to back off. He begs on his knees and tells me he has nothing to say to me but sorry. At this point we have been dating for a year. I’m heartbroken.

5. He messages me a few days later and tells me that he just hasn’t been able to break up with her because they’ve been together for too long. He tells me he is going to that day and wants to talk to me. He cries and begs me over the phone and tells me I’m the only one he loves. He tells me crazy stories about his ex and how shes a psycho and thats why hes also scared to break up with her. Not knowing anything about her and believing him, I meet up with him again.

6. He tells me he wants me back and I’m dumb enough to be convinced that it’s really just a mistake. We start meeting again. Turns out she dumped him for another person too shes been cheating on. I guess cheaters meet cheaters...

7. In January, a month after things happen, I’m back in the US for my last semester of school. Everything seems fine. It is sometimes hard to contact him but we talk several hours nearly every day. I know he has an erratic sleeping schedule so I believe him when he tells me he wasn’t able to pick up because he fell asleep. We meet over spring break for a week and things seem fine. I see a message from a girl on his phone but he tells me it’s just a friend. I believe him because I think nobody would do such a shitty thing as cheating again. I trust he learned his lesson and believe in him.

8. I’m back in my home country in May (2017) after graduation. Although my original goal was to work in Korea, I’m heads over heels in love with this guy who has convinced me we have a future together. He talks about the house we’ll build and lame as it is, I truly believe he loves me too. I end up finding a job near where he lives and work there. Everything seems fine between us. I’m happy and see him nearly every day. We barely argue and things seem to be perfectly fine.

9. It’s next year June (2018). I have happily been with this guy for two and a half years. He logs into his email account to download a movie to my computer. Later, I’m trying to track a parcel I had delivered and click on the ‘shopping/paid list’ of the email end up finding out that his email is logged in still instead of mine. The first thing that pops up is a reservation for a hotel that year February. I had never been there with him. It feels fucking weird. I use his email to hack into his facebook account and find a list of phone numbers that he had recently searched. I write every one of them down. I know it sounds crazy, but I needed evidence. I needed to help myself realize what was happening. I sent a message to about 10 of the numbers and asked if they knew who he was. They tell me that they met him through the dating app. Around half of them had met him in real life but thought he was sketchy since he only contacted them during office hours. Around 3 of them had slept with him on the second date after he ‘confessed’ and told them he wanted to be in a ‘relationship.’ I was fucking shocked. It turns out all of the days that he said he was working overtime and was meeting friends, he was meeting those girls. He had never stopped cheating on me. Since the month that I found out for the first time, he had continuously been cheating on me and lying to me.

10. I confront him with evidence. He tells me it’s a mistake. He was stupid. He tells me he’s crazy and will go to a psychologist and win back my trust. My family lives far away and all my friends are in America. I feel so vulnerable and he is the only one near me. I end up going back to him in a state of vulnerability. I hate myself but end up relying on him more than ever.

11. He tells me we should go on a trip to this island to take our mind off things and get our relationship back on track. We go the first week of June. We have a good time. I give him my last faith.

12. Mid-June. I find an odd message of ‘what are you doing sweetie?’ on his phone. He tells me its from his past and promises that nothing has happened since. I freak out and message the girl my phone number. He tells me she won’t even call me because it’s seriously nothing. He sleeps over and acts perfectly innocent.

13. She calls me the next morning and tells me all about him. They have met up a few days ago and since then, he’s been convincing her to be in a relationship with him and to sleep with him, saying that it will ‘make their relationship stronger and build trust.’ LOL this happened three days after we came back from our trip.

14. He tells me it’s the last time. I’m so used to being cheated on I don’t even feel anything anymore. I feel like I deserve it and that everyone does it to their partner even though I would never do such a thing. We keep meeting. Things seem fine. Even though I feel weird when I think about it seriously, when I meet him things seem fine.

15. We argued last week. Since the last incident, nothing has happened, but I’ve been getting annoyed with him for no reason. I get annoyed and he gets mad. He tells me we should take a break. He escalates and tells me we should break up. I say ‘okay.’ He takes it back. He says we should have a break for a month and then talk about what we want to do then. He tells me that three years is so long to let go all of a sudden. I also feel insecure and say okay.

I know I’m in a shit relationship. Besides the cheating he always makes fun of me. He says he’s just joking but when he tells me I’m pudgy or ugly or dumb, it cuts. I usually laugh it off. I want to use this month to set my mind straight. There have been so many reasons to break up with him but I’ve been feeling so alone in this far away country with no friends and family (they moved to another country recently). I know it makes no sense, my in my heart, I still see him as my best friend and it hurts me so much that I have to let go of something that I literally worked and tried so hard to make work.

Please don’t bash me. I just need a helping voice to help talk some sense into me. I know for a fact that it is a toxic, abusive relationship and would love to talk to this community whenever I’m feeling alone or need to stop myself from messaging him (I am sure he will take me back, so I have to end it myself.)

Thanks for reading this super long post. Would appreciate if you don’t bash me. I already realize I need help and am getting therapy to help myself further."

Just wanting to know your guys opinion on how to handle this bloody mess I created or if you guys have some advice on what to do best and to move on. I've had enough of it and want to get on. (Yes, I am seeing a therapist)

Almost a year ago (August 2017) I was starting to get closer to a friend of mine, which I met on Tinder (November 2016). Let's call him Nate. Since we met, we chat every day, talking about our day to each other. We were becoming really good friends, since we had the same humor and wanted the same things out of life (enjoying life, working hard, healthy lifestyle). I had met Nate briefly in April 2017 and Nate was completely smitten with me, flirting through Messenger and making remarks like: oh, you live in a big city, what if you meet someone much nicer / handsomer than me and blahblahblah. I was flattered, but never saw him as a ""potential partner"" since Nate was almost 15 centimeters shorter than me and lived too far away (yeah, I am shallow bitch, sorry). Nate didn't care about the height difference and was planning a lot of stuff with me: inviting me to spend the vacation with his family, trying to swoon me or impress me with his money and such. I never really saw it as a potential, until a few of my regular flings called me off in the beginning of September 2017. I am a very insecure person whose self-esteem is based on how other people receive it, so the rejection was very harsh. 

After I told my best friend about all of my insecurities and about Nate, who was always so kind to me and was really trying to swoon me. Let's call her Sarah. Sarah took matters into her own hands, asking Nate straight up if he saw me as something more than a friend and he said: ""I wanted to make her (ME) happy, for the rest of her life and if she will have me"". I was completely blown away, since Nate was not that badlooking either. We agreed to meet the next week and I was really looking forward to it, but not expecting too much of it.

We met and it was like finding a long lost friend. Nate and I talked for hours, it was not awkward, it was like we knew each other since we were kids. We talked and talked and lost track of time, resulting in Nate bringing me home to Sarah and her boyfriend Brian and staying over for dinner. After dinner Nate pulled me towards him and kissed me, saying that he wanted to do that all day. I kissed him back, never having felt that in my life before (I had a relationship a few years ago, so I was not and inexperienced kisser, but I never felt that strongly about someone).

The next day, Nate called me and told me to dress up, since his parents wanted to take him out for dinner and he wanted me to tag along. I had a little hour to change from jogging into dress and flats and doing my make up, so I had no time to stress out. I took the metro, jumped into his car and met his parents, who were lovely. It was clearly that they had money, much more money than the class I came from (my parents worked hard for their money and could provide me with everything I wanted, but these people, woow, they had everything their hearts desire. Nate even had a bike for more than 10,000 euros). After dinner they took me to watch tennis - through work (Nate's parents have their own company and Nate was/is supposed to take over after his father steps down) they had tickets - and I couldn't believe their world. It was a bit too much for me, I couldn't quite grasp it and it was going so so fast. After tennis Nate took me to his office, to make out on his desk before returning me to Sarah (we left for a weekend Paris the day after).

Sarah, her boyfriend Brian and me went to Paris for the weekend, but I was very sad I was not with Nate. Nate didn't text me as usual, but he was busy with work. He was making plans to take me to Utrecht the next weekend. Sarah was getting suspicious with how willing I was to discard plans I had already made with her, but I was just so in love with Nate. He was so kind to me, telling me how beautiful I was and how he wanted to make me happy.

When I came back from Paris, I was very eager to introduce him to my parents. Nate was going to pick something up before he came to for them. He got into a motorcycle crash and broke his left knee cap. He was texted me not to freak out, but he told me everything and kept me posted about what the doctors were doing. His mother sent me his room, so I could visit him in the hospital. I took the train the next day and stayed with him for the whole day. I got to meet his sister, who was my age and her boyfriend (who led the company instead of Nate). I cared for Nate, like washing his feet (they were still dirty from the accident) and his parents were glad that I was there for their son.

After a few days Nate was allowed to go home. Uni had started, so I could only come over in the weekends, like I did. When I had my job interview for a internship with a magazine and I got in, Nate bought tickets for The Killers and insisted it was a gift. Nobody had ever done something like that for me. I was noticing how, by the days went by, that Nate was getting more and more depressed. He was a very active guy: after work, he trained like crazy on his bike, worked out very hard. I was trying to motivate him, telling him how he needed to rest well to let his knee heal, or otherwise the revalidation was going to get harder. In total I visited two times, and those times were a bit awkward. His parents left him and me alone and Nate always wanted to make out, despite having his knee broken. I was a bit reluctant and blocking him off to go upstairs to his bedroom. His parents asked me the second time if I wanted to spent New Year's Eve with them in Nice (France), and they would pay for everything, for the penthouse suite and the dinner and the flights. 

After that second visit Nate was really distant. He was worrying about, not coping with his broken knee and keeping silence with me. He was giving me the silent treatment and I was really freaking out. He told me to keep my distance, that he needed time to think. My doctor found it really strange (I was having panic attacks) and told me to go to him and talk to him, face to face and I was willing to ride towards him, but Nate told me that was worst thing to do. He was texting me only, not calling, telling me that he just needed time and I needed to keep calm. I don't remember everything, but I was so depressed and scared because I didn't know anything and I felt I already lost him. I called his parents to ask if they knew what was happening, what was going on, but they told me Nate and I needed to talk and that Nate was just a distant boy. On social media I could see that Nate was following a lot of female IG'ers and I immediately knew things were very very bad. 

In those days my doctor sent me to a therapist, the best one in the neighbourhood and, ironically, my neighbour. My therapist read everything between Nate and me and was really supportive, telling me that I had done nothing wrong. My memory is leaving me right now (It's all a blur), but Nate was really distant with me, never telling me what was going on and just cutting off contact all of a sudden. My therapist tried to call him, asking him to give me an explanation since I couldn't cope with it, and Nate outright refused it, telling my therapist ""that he was wishing me the best of luck"" and I just broke down. Nate had blocked me everywhere on social media and there was no way I could contact him. I sent him a mail (on advice on my therapist + my therapist had seen what I wrote and it was just a request on a chance of talking) and when he didn't answer, I sent it to the general mail of the company, thinking it was the only way. Never heard of him again. 

Fast forward to December 2017; a few days for Christmas. I had lost a lot of weight because of the sadness and the pain and sorrow I was feeling  - I looked like a walking corpse. In the mean time I got my second internship with my dream company and I still don't know how I got in. But, anyhow, I searched Nate in Facebook and discovered the profile of his current girlfriend. I just went crazy. Full head crazy. They were dating just after he went silent on me, telling me how he needed space and couldn't handle a relationship right now. The girl looked a lot like me, only more naive and less educated. I just lost it. I tried to contact her, getting to know how they met (I had a feeling it was through IG) and I lost it completely. I was crying, sought help on campus, got the advice to go home and I overdosed when I was in my apartment. Took every medicine I had laying around and emptied the bottle of vodka, putting a plastic bag over my head to suffocate once I lost consciousness. 

The police found me eventually and brought me to the hospital. My parents were there, crying and Sarah and Brian were there too. 

I got into therapy, got new medication and got through my exams in January. In February I was trying to meet with new people and I went on a date with Daniel. I had a click with Daniel and we talked a lot. He was very interested in me, and I told him the truth: I was damaged goods, I tried to kill myself two months prior, I was still not over Nate. He accepted all of it and he still wanted me. I was distant, still seeing more guys in the hope to numb the pain, having sex with multiple partners.

In March Daniel put me before an ultimatum: being monogamous with him or not seeing him. Since he was one of the few people who knew everything about me and still wanting me, I gave in. We slowly pursued a relationship and in July I moved in with him. 

I am still seeing my therapist, but the last few sessions I am not telling him everything, since I am not that happy with Daniel, while everyone, including my parents and friends, are telling me I need to be so happy with a boyfriend like Daniel, that I would never found someone like him again. I am still so hurt by Nate and not over him, still plotting revenge and hurting when I think of everything and I still need closure: I need to know WHY he dumped me. 

Thank you for reading this shit ass long post.

From October, I'll move to Milano, but only for 3-4 or even 5 months, that will depend of my work contract/work permit approval in Svizzera...

Do you have any idea if it will be hard for me to find a rent for that short period? My expectation for rent is to have a one room apartment: bedroom separate from the kitchen (NO studio), and double bed, because I'll come with my girlfriend. And if there are some, how much is the average cost? and also the guarantee you pay for the first time? 1-2-3 months of rent? The housing agencies are the only one with are speaking English? Do you have any suggestions for websites which offers rent to non-italian speaking people? (I plan to learn Italian when arriving there, and it'll be easy as my native language is latin too).

How are programmers paid in that region? also testers? Is a lot above average salary, or not? Let's say, one with 3-4 years of experience in embedded systems (C/C++)..

Any idea what can I visit and where can I go during my short stay there, in this cold and harsh season? I've been few years ago for an internship, but I just had time to visit the city centre and some museums and was horrible hot! (in June 2012). Is Venice a good place to start?

Grazie mille."

I am hoping to get an internship next summer (junior-&gt;senior) and I want to make sure I take some classes this year that will help me with that. I was thinking maybe the 3 quarter Software Engineering tract CS115, 116, 117 would be good because it is general and project based. Has anyone taken these and/or gotten a cs internship?

I'm currently 19 years old, and am about to go into my sophomore year of college. I go to school at a large public university on a full ride, but got rejected from the Ivies (waitlisted at Cornell though). I study political science and economics, and have loved these subjects for years. This summer I have a decent internship for my first time around, and my grades freshman year were fine. I have been depressed and lonely for most of high school, envious of what I thought other people had. Even though I have a girlfriend (she lives near my university, hours away from me) and work out consistently, I have always felt terrible about my appearance. I don't have any friends, and the only people I talk to are my gf and the people at my internship during work hours. My parents and I have always had an adversarial relationship, and I can tell they would be happier if I was dead. I've been seeing a therapist this summer, which has helped somewhat, but not nearly enough to get me out of this hole. On top of all of this, I have had a problem with porn for most of high school, and when I got to college I experienced e.d. whenever I attempted to have sex. I gave up porn and fapping for four months and was able to get up in April, but since I got home I've been bingeing and I feel like shit. I wanted to see if y'all had any advice for me or just wanted to talk. I hate myself and feel like this will never get better. "

I had my right tragus pierced in May and my left conch on August the 3rd. The tragus seems to be healing fine (no bumps, infections etc) and while the conch is still fresh it hasn't showed any signs of trouble such as swelling.   


My question is this: would it be wise to go for a triple outer conch (on the left ear) during Christmas break or should I wait?   
I'm thinking of doing like 2 of the 3 piercings in one session and the third one a little later because I know that generally I'm kind of a slow healer.   


The thing is that Christmas and Summer breaks are the only time I can get those piercings because I want them done by my regular piercer in my home country, to which I only return at those times, as I'm studying abroad.   
Also, I'd rather not wait until the summer break because I will be rather busy with work and internships, and taking care of 3 new piercings at the same time seems a bit much.

&gt;FORUM:
In “Tomorrow Will Be Different,” Sarah McBride writes candidly about transitioning to a transgender woman. McBride worked as an intern in the White House under President Obama and now works for the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBT advocacy organization. McBride joins us to discuss her memoir, her work in politics and losing her husband to cancer four days after their wedding.

&gt;Guests:

I sent the following email, which was read on the air:

&gt;I am so glad you invited Ms. McBride to the program.  I am an late 60s, straight religious man who over the years have had my life greatly enriched by the transgender people I have known, some of whom took a risk to let me know when they weren't out to the public.

&gt;Our society will be a much better place for all of us when we allow a place for those of us with this relatively rare form of giftedness.

DP, I'm a 16 year old girl currently living with my dad and his new wife. My stepmother and stepbrothers are pretty cool. I'm not very close to them, but we respect each others' space. My problem is my stepmother's sister sees me as free babysitting. Since school has let out, she has dumped her 12 year old son, 8 year old daughter, and 4 year old son at our house with no notice. My dad and stepmother are at work, so that means I get woken up by my stepbrothers not wanting to deal with the babies. No one asked me, no one is paying me, and this is not how I want to spend my summer vacation. I have had to cancel so many plans because I can't leave these kids alone. I complained to my dad and my stepmother and nothing changes. They say they will talk to my stepmother's sister -- she steamrolls over everyone. I really hate this. I don't want to cause waves, since my dad and stepmother have not been married very long. I don't want to make this a ""thing,"" but this is not chores or curfew. I should be getting paid for this work. I could go live with my mom until school starts, or invent an internship and get up early to go to the library, but I don't want to go across the country or lie.

Podcast LW2: Leave her at home

DP, My brother has been very lonely after his wife died. Then, suddenly, he met Sandy, a girl younger than his daughters. He pays for her apartment, car, and showers her with expensive gifts. Sandy has no visible career or education. My son googled her and found out she was a sex worker. I'm struggling to understand why my brother would do this. But worse, is why he insists on dragging the rest of our family into it. Sandy is his quote ""girlfriend."" Sandy loves him and Sandy deserves to sit beside him at family dinners and parade herself in front of the pastor that presided over his own wedding and the baptisms of his children. I am disgusted with my brother. He will not listen to any sense and loudly insists that we are all ""prejudiced"" against his ""finding love again."" This is sickening and is affecting his relationship with his daughters. One just got engaged, and her father refuses to attend any events unless Sandy is invited as well. My niece wants to get married in the church that her parents did. Her mother is buried in the graveyard across the road. My brother's sex life is his own. If he wants to pay for a sex worker, that's his choice, but I don't think I should have to speak to her at brunch. Can you help me?

Podcast LW3: How do I and my partner avoid stoner shame?

DP, my partner and I have been dating for about six years, and we first met when I moved to a major city on the west coast from the Midwest. We met through mutual friends, and he was selling drugs -- weed, and some uppers -- as a full time gig. A few months later he'd broken up with his girlfriend and we started dating, and he decided to go back to school for his undergraduate degree. He decided that selling drugs wasn't how he wanted to spend the rest of his life, and I fully support this decision. Since we've met, however, I have used cannabis to help manage my epilepsy symptoms. This causes a slight tension on our relationship, primarily in how much is used. His family still has a pot farm in northern California, and though I think it would be amazing to start a medical marijuana business, because it has helped me so much. I went from 3-4 seizures per year to zero, and because right now, as a small farm in a state that has legalized recreational weed, his family is struggling to keep it going, and sustain themselves financially. However, he is hesitant to start this type of business, and would prefer to find a quote ""legitimate way"" of using the land. How do I best explain to him my intentions, without bringing up past familial dysfunction in regards to drug use, and his goals of working outside of the medical marijuana industry?

\*\*\*

Podcast LW4: Bad guest

DP, Recently, we went out of town with some friends. They're closer to my boyfriend than to me, but my family has a vacation home at a popular tourist spot, and I was excited to go together. I really like them -- or so I thought. They were awful guests. Snapping at me; sticking me with the tab for two out of four dinners (we split the other 2) and grocery runs; borrowing money that they stalled to pay back; keeping dollar for dollar track of cab fares even though I spent almost double what they had at that point, not even counting the loan. On the last night, after the final round of promises to pay me back the cash I spotted them, I finally lost it. I wasn't very kind to them, and we left on bad terms. I shouldn't have handled it that way, and I did apologize profusely, once on the day we left, and then again via text. My problem is, I know my boyfriend will push to invite them again. He's already talking about ""next time."" Frankly, I don't want to invite them ever again, and I probably need a break from hanging out with them for a good while. They're his oldest and closest friends though, and honestly I don't know how sustainable it is to not have them to the house ever again. Is there a way to manage this better next time, or do you think it's fair to say we just don't travel well together and fight the battle to leave them out?"

##How The Chart Works:

These charts are created based on how frequently each song appears in the top 10 songs/albums for all of the users signed up for the chart. If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurrence, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for the last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each.

971hia,647,2018-08-13,Caught my boss and coworker in the act [MF],dumbestjock,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/971hia/caught_my_boss_and_coworker_in_the_act_mf/,"I just finished my summer internship at a consulting firm. When I started there at the beginning of summer, I instantly noticed this girl that I will call Summer. She was a year out of school making her 2 years old than me (23 and 21). She was the hottest girl in the office. She was an easy 8 in office clothes and based on her Instagram, a 10 when she cleaned up. She was a lean 5'8'' redhead with D's at least and a perky ass. 

We hit it off right away. The firm had lots of social events and happy hours. I would hit on her at most of them and she seemed to reciprocate. A couple weeks in, the firm took us to a baseball game with free beer and food. She and I were really hitting it off and I thought I might close the deal that night. She was going easy on the beer because her team had a big client meeting the next morning. Around the 7th inning, her director came over and pulled her away so they and the others on the team could have a conversation about their meeting. Me and a few of the other interns went to load up on beers before they closed sales at the end of the inning.

When I came back, I couldn't find her. Someone said she left early along with most of her team. Fair enough I figured, they had a big meeting. The next day was Friday and I didn't see her because of her meeting. On Monday, she started acting different. She seemed to be keeping her distance and being aloof. I wondered if I had offended her somehow but I couldn't think of anything she could be offended by. I wrote it off to her having a bad day, but it kept up for the rest of the week. A group of us went out one night and she passed giving a vague answer about other plans. 

After that week, I gave up on hooking up with her. It was disappointing, but I had other girls that I had my eye on plus I had a friend with benefits from high school in the city.

Cut ahead to last week. It was the final week of my internship. On Tuesday, a bunch of us decided to go out. Since most of the people lived north of work, we went out in that direction. I live south of work so I decided to leave my bag at work and pick it up on the way back. I and other people had done this before. It was a normal thing. 

A little before 8:00, I got a text from a girl I had hooked up with the week before. I decided to leave and meet up with her. I went back to the office to pick up my stuff. When I got into the office, I heard some sounds. It was sort of grunting and I thought for a second it might be the janitor or someone working hard. After few steps, I heard a girl's moan. I knew exactly what that was.

I was about 15-20 feet into the office and headed straight for my desk. The moan made me turn my head to the side. I looked straight into one of the director's offices and there he was naked pounding Summer. She was laying on her back on his desk with her skirt bunched around her waist and no other clothes. Her head was thrown back with her eyes closed. Her big natural tits jiggled every time the director slammed into her. I was perpendicular to the direction he was facing so he didn't notice me.

I froze there watching them. It felt like an eternity but it was probably 15 seconds give or take. The moan I heard must have been her cumming. The director slowed down then pulled out and told her to roll over onto her stomach.  This guy had a no joke porn star's dick. I always thought I was pretty big (most girls I've been with have remarked on it but I'm sure girls tell every guy that), but this guy was unlike anything I'd ever seen in the real world. If I had to guess, at least 8 inches, maybe 9.

She gave a long moan and said ""Yes daddy."" Hearing her voice snapped me out of my trance. I realized I could get caught so I quickly backed up so there was no long a sight line between me and the door and hoped like hell they didn't see me. When I heard him start grunting and her start moaning again, I left as quickly and quietly as I could. I figured I'd get my bag the next day.

I was in shock. When I met up with the girl I was going to see, we had a good chuckle about it. When I fucked her that night, I only thought about Summer and her big tits jiggling and her sexy fucking moaning. 

The next day, Summer and her director acted perfectly normal. By my guess, they started hooking up either after the baseball game or while celebrating after their big meeting the next day. It made sense why she suddenly started posting pictures on Instagram of her in a bikini on a big ass boat half way through the summer. "

I’m packing my bags today. I’ve been visiting my SO since May. I wish I could just be here, year-round but we’re from Texas, thousands of miles away. I understand that I need to graduate first. Please don’t remind me. The fall semester awaits, and with it an internship where little minds and hearts need me to be there for them no matter how bad I may feel. 

I’m packing my bags now. He’s at work for the next five hours; I don’t want him to see this. He hasn’t cried yet, but I know he’s being strong til I’m past the TSA just like last time.  I’m leaving on Wednesday and his mother will be there to catch him once we say our ‘see you soon’s. 

I wish I could stay so badly. I wish I could just transfer, but my financial status has me bound to my home state until I graduate. The programs are phenomenal here. It’s so friendly towards my chronic health issues and so ready for young folks to revolutionize whatever it is they chose to do for the better. 

Mom, I know you’re excited for my return. I know you’ve missed me. I love that you bathed our sweet doggo so he’d be all clean and would smell good when I come through that door. But Mom, this is hard. This hurts. How do I tell you what I feel when you’re just so happy to see me home? I know you’ve worried about me. I’ve been worried for you too, especially since it’s hurricane season. 

Mom, I’m moving here when I graduate in 2020/2021. He’s who I want to be with. We’ve already bought the plane tickets for my birthday (Dec 27) for me to return only to go back home for the spring semester. You’re going to be so happy to have me back...but I’ll be counting down the days each time I return. I love you Mom, but I really love him too. 

So I’m packing my bags, through the tears. I’m trying to be strong for everyone else. I’m failing at it miserably. I’ve always prided myself for being so mature and stoic, but I’ve always been emotional and sensitive deep down. 

This hurts and I really wish you were here. I’m not looking forward to crying in front of strangers and being alone for hours. I miss your hugs, but I’m gonna miss him horribly too. "

I'm eager to leverage my student status into internships and work opportunity in LA along with my studies.

I have my foot in the door with somebody who works casting at United Talent Agency that I think has a good chance of working out. (She also sent me a list of several other intern openings through UTA with some production companies.) It sounds like a good opportunity for experience in different parts of production that I am less familiar with.

On the other hand my school is cautioning against biting off more than I can chew my first year. So I'm trying to figure out if I should go forward with this to see where it goes to sit tight for a bit.

Anyway, does anybody have an experience working for or with UTA? Should I go for it and add this to an already busy semester? Does it sound worth it i guess?

Any insight is much appreciated.
Thanks."

I am part of a 3 year accelerated bachelor degree program for Computer Science. It is a requirement for us to get an internship the second summer of our studies and am finally at the stage where I need to come up with a list of companies that I will apply to to get an internship.  I have been consumed by the love for blockchain/cryptocurrencies/smart-contracts but I don't know what companies might have something for interns. I know Coinbase has a position for software engineer interns but I cant really seem to find other companies that have something like this. There are either no internship positions or they are protocols with bounty programs (which I can't do due to my program).  

I am pretty sure someone else is also in my boat looking for internships, so I was hoping we could come up with a list of companies that have some sort of internship program for undergrads. My main focus is in software engineering but we can add any internship positions like security and such. This is my first post on reddit but I have seen others edit their post, and I will edit the bottom of this post with links posted by others.  "
972kop,1,2018-08-13,How long to wait for new piercings???,Totor0-0,Legitpiercing,https://www.reddit.com/r/Legitpiercing/comments/972kop/how_long_to_wait_for_new_piercings/,"Hi all!

I had my right tragus pierced in May and my left conch on August the 3rd. The tragus seems to be healing fine (no bumps, infections etc) and while the conch is still fresh it hasn't showed any signs of trouble such as swelling.

My question is this: would it be wise to go for a triple outer conch (on the left ear) during Christmas break or should I wait?  
I'm thinking of doing like 2 of the 3 piercings in one session and the third one a little later because I know that generally I'm kind of a slow healer.

The thing is that Christmas and Summer breaks are the only time I can get those piercings because I want them done by my regular piercer in my home country, to which I only return at those times, as I'm studying abroad.  
Also, I'd rather not wait until the summer break because I will be rather busy with work and internships, and taking care of 3 new piercings at the same time seems a bit much.

What do you think?"
972o2e,3,2018-08-13,Resume Critique,zoldykk,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/972o2e/resume_critique/," Hi everyone,

I am looking for feedback on my [resume](https://imgur.com/a/lJK0OCV). I also have a couple questions about the upcoming interview season.

1. If asked why I did not return to my internship company, what should I say? That it was not a good fit? I'm looking to try something different, but there was nothing in particular that I can point out as to why I didn't return. I think saying ""I'm looking for something different"" may be sufficient for a life/health/consulting company, but may not work as well for another P&amp;C company. Any thoughts?
2. A couple months back, our restaurant was without any full time staff (there should be two) so I filled in for a lot of the responsibilities that they would normally have. Should I put this on my resume or is that something more so for a cover letter?
3. Is there anything I can work on in the next few weeks to make me a more well rounded candidate? I think my weakest point is my coding skills (with R, SAS, VBA, etc.) but they're not that bad.

Thanks everyone!"

What can I do to be there for her as she's working her way through this?** 

My younger sister (I'll call her Claire) is 21 and a college junior, hoping to proceed to a PhD in her field. She's smart, personable, sweet, and responsible, which should make her an amazing asset wherever she goes. She's also gorgeous, and unfortunately that's the first thing people see about her. This isn't her first time being sexually harassed, though it's been more low-key- a bit of wolf whistling and one not-particularly-bothersome professor. But she's never before been in a situation like this.     

Claire is currently in an internship in which, while she's working in a professional and for-profit context, her boss is influential in academia in her field and so there is a lot of academic potential for the internship. She currently works in the office, but also receives mentorship in her field by the professionals there and she's said that it's been a real learning experience. Her office is a branch office (there are three or four), and on a day to day basis she works with a group of professionals who she has no complaints about. Until recently, she was really enjoying this gig.     

Every couple of weeks, the head of the whole organization (who I'll call Dr Harassment) pays a visit to each of the branch offices from the main office, where he works full time. It ended up taking Claire a month to first meet him, as she was absent the first time that he visited during her tenure. However, she observed conference calls between him and the staff at her office, and noticed that he was pretty aggressive and that the staff at her office generally complained a lot about him behind his back. 

Dr Harassment first met Claire a month into her tenure, and he was immediately nice to her, much more so than he had been on Skype with the whole office. She figured he was just being friendly (they're in a field where there is a lot of interaction with members of the public, so it's kind of expected that even assholes know how to act nice) and thought nothing of it. However, she started to notice that he was visiting the office a lot more than he had been before, and that he was seeking her out. She was initially happy about this, because due to his status in the academic world she figured that if he liked her he would be more likely to write her a rec letter for grad school, but it started to feel creepy to her.     

When Claire started off at this office, she heard about an academic paper which people in the office were writing together with Dr Harassment. She thought that sounded really cool, but she was shocked when her immediate supervisor at the office (someone who she has no complaints about) told her that Dr Harassment wanted her to do some work on the paper (mostly literature review) and if she did then she'd get authorship credit. This is basically unheard of for an undergrad, so she was over the moon. This meant that she started to be invited to paper-writing meetings, and that's basically when the trouble started. Claire hasn't wanted to go too much into detail about what he's been saying, but apparently on his (more frequent than usual) visits to the office, he has been cornering her in the hallway. He initially started by trying to invite her out for coffee or dinner, which she refused. (She thinks he's married, but isn't sure.) He then progressed to making explicit remarks about her body, which of course made her very uncomfortable. 

Today, he shut the two of them in her office after closing and tried to make an advance on her. She has a good three inches on him and honestly could probably beat him in a fight, but she was incredibly intimidated because of what he was saying: that he was giving her all of this opportunity, that if she went along with it she'd have a clear ticket to grad school at the extremely prestigious university where he teaches, that if she didn't it would be incredibly ungrateful of her (there was no explicit threat made, but she got the gist), that he could tell that she knew he was interested in her and was attracting him to her consciously (of course she wasn't), and that nobody would ever have to know. As he was saying all of this, he was edging closer to her, and she could tell he was going to try to make a move. She ran out of the office before he could touch her, got into the car and drove home.  

She came into the house sobbing hysterically. I was the only one home when she came in, and she initially refused to tell me what was wrong when I asked her. She ended up telling me, and then afterward my parents. We were in shock- she hadn't said ANYTHING to us about this up until that point. (She can be a bit quiet, and she thinks that Dr Harassment took that as the kind of shyness that would prevent her telling anyone.) She still hasn't figured out what exactly she wants to do about the situation (she's only there three days a week, and doesn't have to go back until Thursday this week), but she and my parents are planning her options- they're talking about reporting him to the accreditation board in his field (which would be a MAJOR deal), reporting him to his university, talking to Claire's supervisor at the branch office, talking to the police, talking to a lawyer. They haven't made any moves yet. She already has a therapist, and they've booked an emergency appointment for tomorrow. (If anyone has any specific ideas, I'm sure they would come in useful, but I'm pretty sure that she and my parents can take care of that on their own, so that's not my biggest concern.)

My question is- what can I do to be there for her on a more personal level? I love Claire, she's my little sister, but we've had a bit of a rocky relationship in the past- I moved out for college while she stayed put (which she resented) and then moved back home recently, and we've had some conflict when discussing our respective mental health issues which has led to a lot of sharp words. We're very different people and it shows in the very different ways we communicate. Right now, the only people who know about this are my parents, Claire, and me, and while I have no idea whether she plans on confiding in others (we have another sister who currently has no idea), I want to make sure that I don't make the wrong move to further traumatize or anger her but also want to express my support for her at this time. I'm so furious right now and my instinct is to be protective, but I also recognize that that might not be what she wants right now. In the past she's criticized me for trying to baby her and being overbearing, which is obviously the last thing I want to do, but I also want to be there in a way that truly will help. I'm also feeling a lot of guilt that I didn't notice anything was happening, though I recognize that it's because Claire didn't want us to know, which was her right at the time. I just want to help, and I don't want to do it wrong.

What can I do to help Claire as she goes through this? Is there anything I can do practically? What are the best ways to support a victim of sexual harassment and near-assault? "

however, before i got an offer from this company, i got an offer from a different company about 3 months prior. 

Because i had applied to many placed prior to this, i got really excited and I had already accepted this position from the one that i was not so interested in because it was not within the concentration that i was really keen on investing. 

anyways, the thing is, I really wanted to take the offer from the other one that i wanted more. but i felt bad to say to the one that i didnt like how i didnt want to be a part of their company anymore and just decline after 3 months. so during this summer, i was at the job that i didnt really want to be a part of because everyone told me it is not proper etiquette to refuse a job position that i have accepted. 

so my question is, what should i have told the other company to perhaps have had worked at the other position. 

tl;dr: got a job offer that i really didnt want but still took it because idk if i was going to get anything else. 3 months later, I actually got a job offer that I really wanted but didnt take it because i didnt want to burn bridges so early on in my career. "

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

So the time has come for DS to make his arrival, and MLM is actually home for the weekend.

I  end up going into the hospital because I am in so much pain (back) that  I am crying. The tell me I am not in labor and give me something for  pain and send me home. They did not do a ultra-sound, just monitored for  contractions, and checked to see if I was dilated.

The  next morning, I am bleeding so back to the hospital we go and we find  out that the DS flipped breech in the birth canal. One of the interns  comments that I was lucky apparently, since he was already in the birth  canal when he flipped we both could have died. After they tried to turn  the baby WITHOUT drugs, DS refused to budge so they tell me that it is  c-section time. My family has a strange medical history with epidurals  so that is out  (partial and lingering paralysis) . I am going under  general anesthesia, needless to say I a little freaked out. MLM steps  out to make some phone calls, and comes back with food and proceeds to  eat in front of me. He steps out again, and a nurse grabs him and tells  him he needs to change into scrubs so he can go into the delivery room.  He and the nurse come back into the room in scrubs and my nurse asks why  he is in scrubs. General anesthesia means no one else is allowed in the  deliver room.

MLM pitches a fit worthy  of a two year at being told he will not be allowed in the room. He tells  me TO SUCK IT UP AND GET THE EPIDURAL, and rants and raves that he has  the right to be in the room (apparently entitlement does not fall far  from the crazy tree). I got so upset the nurse kicked him out of the  room. She got me calmed down,  and about 45 min later asked me if I  wanted to let him come back room, when we hear a commotion out in the  hall, MLM was pitching another fit trying to get back into the room. He  is screaming and yelling that no one will keep him from his child. That I  can't do this to him and so on.  I looked at the nurse, and said NO, I  don't want him to come back in.  Security was called and he was told  that if he did not go sit quietly in the waiting room, they would escort  him out of the building.

And that is the story of how MLM did not meet his son until he was 6 hours old."

I honestly thought that was it though and its no way this pile of crap was coming back. 

Look at my DVR one day, what do you know, its back lol. I decided, why not, I like to see how they get rid of that asteroid, I'll give it another chance. I made it to three episodes before I couldn't do it anymore. It managed to get even DUMBER. When they made Tanz Vice President  I thought it was just college interns smoking weed who now wrote for this show at this point. Then that was followed by him being shot but lived because he had a bullet proof shirt???? (WTF man?) The plots have just become SO ridiculous and I was getting lost trying to remember all the ridiculous BS.

I didn't decide to stop watching so much as I just kept delaying the next episode and the next and so on to the point I'm now five weeks behind. I actually erased them from my DVR but I do All Access so I can watch them all easily still. Question is, should I?

For people like me who had a lot of problems with this show, has it gotten better at all? Does it look like they are at least heading for an ending or has it gotten more stupid and convoluted? I'm guessing the latter but I might be surprised?

Another question, why does CBS make so many idiotic summer sci fi shows???? I got through all 3 insufferable seasons of Under the Doom lol. It was the ultimate train wreck you couldn't look away from. Then I tried that Halle Berry one, Extant, which look like it had a lot of promise but was awfully dull and felt like it went nowhere in the first season. I never even watched the second one. 

And now this bag of crap. For a network that has so few sci fi shows you would think they could make ONE decent one by now. "

Her Nursing, me Construction Management. I am currently an Assistant Project Engineer, will be Project Engineer when I graduate. I currently use Mint to track all of our expenses.

Estimated salaries upon graduating: Me - $55k minimum. Her - $40k minimum. I have worked for the same company past two summers for internships and am working part time during this school year, with a job offer after graduating. I have friends &amp; family at the company and starting pay last year was $62k not including bonuses. It is a very tiered and set pay scale.

* *Student loans (all federal and less than 5%) - $65,500* total for both of us. No more needed.
* *Her car - $170/mo* ($2k left)
* *My truck - $320/mo* but *actually* paying *$400/mo* (just bought, 4% interest, $19k total balance (72 mos) **\*more details on this below**
* *Rent, utilities, food - $1,200/mo covered with grants/scholarships*
* Gas &amp; enterainment *- $400*

Total current expenses - \~$900

I am currently making $1,500/mo working part time, she is not working this year.

Leftover = $500, saving for now.

* Savings - $16,000
* Checking - $10,000
* Crypto account - $1,500 (got for free, leaving it for now)
* Truck payment account - $3,000

FUTURE PLANS (barring anything not working as planned obviously)

Salaries rounded down, expenses rounded up

* *Income - $5,600/mo after taxes*
* *Rent &amp; utilities - $1,500/mo (guesstimate based off past summer costs due to working in diff. state)*
* *Food - $400*
* *Car payments - $770 ($600/mo on mine, will put her $170 towards mine when hers is paid off)*
* *Phones and insurances - $0 (100% company paid for me when graduating, parents pay mine currently and wives for hers for the foreseeable future)*
* *Student loans - $1,500 (should be about 2x the required payment?)*
* *Gas - $400 (company paid after 5 years)*
* *Entertainment, misc, etc - $400 ( we are fairly frugal)*

Leftover = $630 (save half, loans other half?)

With this, loans should be done in about

How are we looking currently and future plans (aside from truck payment please)? I would like to move some of this current extra money into IRAs or something else for both of us, but not sure if it is the best option.

Savings account is planned to stay untouched and kept for a starting E-fund when we graduate, to throw all extra money at debts. My company has fully paid pension as well, fully vested after 7 years.

This should have all our debts paid off in less than 8 years which we are okay with considering salary increases + bonuses will be giving us extra money every couple of years until then.

We don't plan on buying a house anytime soon as we both want to travel for work (housing will get paid for due to moving for work + per diem, so that may free up an extra $1k/mo) I calculated everything as if we were paying for housing and no additional per diem, though.

Raises and bonuses are common in my career, within 5 years I should be making around $80k myself without bonuses. The company starts pay a little lower on purpose.

**\*Truck info** \-  am paying $400/mo and will increase when I graduate, I know 72 mos is idiotic, I took it to have the option of lower payments, but the total interest difference was less than $1k at 48 vs 72, so worst case I am out an extra $1k over a few years and I can live with that.

I saved for a couple of years to use as a down payment when graduating. My old truck just died, I got a cheaper one than I was planning on to not use a down payment, and am using that money for monthly payments until graduating. I know this is a bad idea, but I went over all the worst case scenarios and we will be 100% okay (both parents are able to help as needed and currently pay for misc expenses, phones, insurance, etc.)

If you want to tear me a new one for the truck - go ahead (I expect it), but I'd like some input on future plans atleast hahah"

I graduated in May 2018 with a master's of accounting and 150 credits.

I slept great and woke up having a very normal day. Until about 1 o'clock when my mother called. I figured she was calling to ask how my job hunt was going and i was going to tell her the same thing i told her yesterday. Unfortunately, when i answered the phone this was not the case. She whimpered my name in a panicked voice, i had her on speaker phone because my housemate and i were setting up our new wifi network. Him and I glanced at each other knowing something was wrong. I quickly took her off speaker phone and walked to get a better signal. I dont remember exactly what she said but i will never forget how she said it. She told me my father had a stroke and she was on her way to the hospital. 

Now, my father has never ever had a serious medical problem. He's the healthiest 55 year old man on planet earth. He goes to the gym four times a week and does more on top of that. He's lost around thirty pounds this year alone. But what happened was the luckiest unlucky thing. 

Our family owns a small business, nothing fancy but we're comfortable. Another business down further in the same strip mall had gone out of business and closed down shortly before. We bought a bunch of equipment from them in their auction. My father walked down the back alley behind the strip and walked in he door, talked to the guys running the auction and distribution of stuff for a bit. He learned that if he paid with a credit card they would charge an extra 5%. So he turned around, went back to our business and pulled cash to pay. He returned, again throuh the alley way. He gets back to them and continues the exchange. The two gentlemen noticed he was slurring his words and looked weak. They had him sit down and called an ambulance. Turns out, these two guys weren't always auctioneers. One of the was a cop and the other was a first responder. i still cant believe it. It seems too lucky to be true. But they were able to recognize the symptoms before the full stroke kicked in. He was rushed to the hospital and given TPA (a medicine for stroke victims). Because he had spoken with them a once already before he went to get cash, they knew what business was ours. They called and asked for my mom and told said ""something happened to your husband, hes being taken to X hospital"" she was in shock. She thought he was dead. She immediately called me and that's when i was with my housemate setting up the wifi. 

Now, i dont normally have a car at school. But because i was looking for a internship, my parents gave me one to get around the city easier. I drove two hours straight to the hospital. At this point, the TPA had set in and he was doing great. They inserted a catheter into his thigh and used that entry point to investigate what happened. Turns out one of the arteries in his neck was disected and part of the clot broke off and went into his brain. Luckily, because he was rushed to the hospital and given TPA in time, he was going to be fine. We stayed with him and talked for awhile and all calmed down. He looked like he didnt even have a stroke. He was just tired. My other brother had driven from his med school (him being in med school is relevant later) to see us as well. 

Finally, around 10 pm i finally was able to go home (actual home, not school home) my brother drove back to his school because he had an event or something in the morning. My mother was staying in the hospital with him that night. Anyways, I get home, plop down on the couch with my dog and a beer and finally have a chance to relax and slow down. I watch tv for a bit then go to bed. That night i left my phone on full ringer volume, just in case, and was woken up by another phone call from my mother. Shes hysterical again. She tells me he has had another stroke and was being rushed into emergency surgery. My heart sinks. I was going to lose my father. She tells me her friends are one their to pick me up and bring me back and she doesn't want me to drive. I sprint around the house getting my shoes on and calling my brothers (i have two but one is too far away to come home via car). My two brothers and i are in a three way call, Med school brother tells us everything he heard from my mom. 

Essentially, they have to perform an emergency experimental surgery that isn't technically FDA approved. My mom had to sign off on it. The doctor said he ""wasn't hopeful"". I break down in tears in my driveway and just cant think straight at all. When im finally picked up, i still cant control myself, im sniffling and bawling my eyes out. My moms friend speeds the entire way there (it was like 2 am so the roads were empty). We are finally within view of the hospital and we see lights flashing behind us. Its the police. We are all pissed at this point. The cop walks up and says the usual ""know why i pulled you over"" to which the friend says ""probably because i was speeding!"". Cop says ""no, it's cause you just blew through that blinking red light."" Other friend leans forward from passenger seat points at me and yells ""his dad just had a stroke and is in emergency surgery!"" Officers eyes widen and she takes her ID and says ""ok, ill be quick!!"" Sprints to her car, is there for under thirty seconds, sprints back, hands us the ID and says we're good to go!

They drop me off i front so i can run in and not wait to park. I sprint through the guest check in and go straight upstairs, i find my mom, and i hug her like ive never hugged her before. We are both crying uncontrollably into each others shoulders. We don't know what to do. We can't lose him. He's my dad and i still need him. Eventually my brother gets there and the three of us, my moms two friends, and my brothers roommate (she drove him from school) are just waiting. We sit and wait and try to make normal talk but we all know its not normal. 

Finally, around 530 am the surgeon walks out. We spring up and he tells us the surgery went well. We cant believe it. He explains that they have a stroke severity rating system. Its 0 to 15. The first stroke was a 2, very mild and easy to treat. The second stroke however, was a 14. He goes on to explain that they used three stents. One normal one and two experimental ones. He says the surgery went well but they need to run several more tests before they know. My mom and I both slept at the hospital that night. However, the nurses had to come in every 15 minutes and wake him up to see how he was doing. They asked him questions like where he was, what year it was, asked him to squeeze their hands, follow with his eyes, etc.

The following day, we waited and waited for test results. I believe he did two CT scans (one on his brain and one focusing on his arteries) and an MRI that day. He's falling asleep the second he closes his eyes. Can barely talk more than one word answers. Things are better but not good. But hes alive.

Fast forward a few days of constant testing, scanning, examining, and LOTS of sleep, he's doing incredible. Hes still tired all the time, but he was able to walk around a bit, go up some stairs, and he talks almost normally. Hes still sleepy and a little confused, but hes doing unbelievably well. 

Our insurance just approved rehab for him so hes going down tomorrow to the rehab facility in another part of the building. He just wants to come home and be like he was 6 days ago but this is good. Im typing this next to his bed while he sleeps. 

Im just happy to have my father in my life still. He's the best dad you could ask for."

She watched over my pets for a few months while I was out of town for an internship and I wanted to pay her back for that as well as have her birthday and Christmas presents all wrapped into one! I have built a PC before so I have the tiniest bit of experience.

**\*\*What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.\*\***

She loves video games but has been unable to play any on PC for a few years because her current computer is on the verge of dying and she cant afford to replace it until after holiday season and Fall semester is over. She plays games like Overwatch, draws with programs like Sai and Photoshop, and wants to get into streaming.

**\*\*What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?\*\***

$500 but there is some wiggle room. I'd also personally prefer buying from amazon.

**\*\*When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.\*\***

I'd probably buy all the parts this Wednesday when I get paid.

**\*\*What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc\\)\*\***

Just the computer itself, the operating system, and maybe a wifi adapter. She has all the peripherals she needs currently.

**\*\*Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?\*\***

USA, North Carolina. And not anywhere near a MicroCenter unfortunately.

**\*\*If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.\*\***

Just reusing peripherals.

**\*\*Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?\*\***

Nope.

**\*\*Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)\*\***

Just the ability to stream and play a game like Overwatch at the same time without the computer immediately overheating haha.

**\*\*Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?\*\***

My only request is that the case have a window to see the insides. I don't personally mind if any of the parts have LEDs or what colors they come in.

**\*\*Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?\*\***

Yes, I would. Windows 10 preferred."

Ended last week because he basically didn't want a relationship with me [should've seen that coming]. Ended it saying we should be friends.

We are both in the same industry and he has a job at a company that's very difficult to get into but amazing once you're in bc of how good it is on your resume and connections. He's talked about this company since I met him last year and it's always been his goal. 

Few months after I met him, my old boss and co-workers at my internship suggested I work for this company after graduation. It is a ""training ground"" for people who want to work in my industry and gets you great experience. For 6 months I tried to avoid it, even though I was intrigued, because he works there and I don't want to step in on his territory and make him think I'm doing it for him.. I'm currently out of college, unemployed, applied for other jobs and haven't gotten anything. My old boss has been in contact with me and says he can get me the job because of his connections and that I should apply. I'm so hesitant especially since we're officially broken up and I wouldn't even want to bring it up to him. Plus I'd see him a lot at the job because new hires/graduates work together. IDK how he'll react but I don't want to hold myself back because of some dumbass who didn't even want to date me. He's already wasted a year of my life relationship wise.. 

Opinions/experiences/help? I could really use an outside opinion.  

TL;DR- Should I apply/potentially work for a company my shitty ex is at? Would benefit my career and is a great opportunity. But I'd see him quite often. "

974uvy,48,2018-08-13,Where does the drive and energy come from for these individuals who have high paying tech jobs at Silicon Valley or Seattle/LA region?,throwawaynewacc,AskMenOver30,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenOver30/comments/974uvy/where_does_the_drive_and_energy_come_from_for/,"I'll start of with a story. Back when I was in high school, I met a family friend who I felt very indifferent about. Of course, I was not too socially confident but there was something unbelievably different about it (which I couldn’t understand). It was her energy. Embarrassingly, I was intimidated by her level of confidence and experience.  

Eventually, as time progressed, we both went different paths as she went to a prestigious school while I went to a smaller state university. 

From family friends, I’ve heard her accomplishments were incredible. Oh man, where do I begin? She graduated with 2 degrees within 5 years, this is bachelors and masters in computer engineering. Then accepts her first job at a tech company with a 6 figure salary. Within 3 years, she’s given a promotion and purchases a house (for $700k). She’s settled within 2017 and decides it isn’t enough. By 2018, she got a another job thats paying nearly $200k. Now, I hear she’s looking for another house to purchase while keeping her old house on rent. 

Comparing my achievements with her, I completed 2 undergrad degrees in engineering, 5 internships with an undergrad research, graduated right out of college with a job paying decent salary that gives me comfortable life to live on my own. I should probably state that I barely graduated because my final semester I fell and I got a concussion. My grades blew up and I was close to having my job offer revoked. While ignoring all my health problems, I pushed on and graduated on time. 

The point is, it took me 7 years to climb from $0 to upper $70k while it took her the same time and she climbed from $0 to near $200k (and with a $700k house as an investment property). 

This is clearly the work ethics level of a CEO (like Indra Nooyi, Sheryl Sandberg). Its not the money thats appealing, but more of **where the energy and drive come from? How is it possible that some humans can achieve so much, in such a short time, while the rest of us are living average life? Why are these people different from the rest of us?**"

I’ve been playing guitar since I was 8, producing music since I was 17, I play a bit of piano, was in choir in high school and took music classes, have a decent amount of knowledge of music theory, go to college for sound design, and I’ve been writing for orchestras this year. I mostly make indie rock, electronic music, and orchestral music.

I feel like I’m pretty well rounded, but it’s so difficult making a track for yourself and doing all the instruments and production. Vocals and drum beats are where I struggle the most, so I’ve been focusing on those lately.

But I feel like it’d be so much easier if I just had someone to work with, but I’ve had collaborator’s steal my songs or be incredibly unreliable.

I’ve been lucky to be able intern with/ show my music to professionals who said that my diverse skill set is valuable, but can I really do this on my own?

I know Mike Shinoda from Linkin Park works solo right now, but he’s one of the only people I know who can do everything.

I’ve been composing for video games and short films and that’s been easier than just writing personal songs.

But I just want to know if it’s possible to do this or what’s the best way to go about this.

I would hope to find a great collaborator soon."

97777m,6,2018-08-14,[Request] Finding a Good Computer Chair: Steelcase Leap V2 vs Lower tier models,EnglandlsMyCity,BuyItForLife,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/97777m/request_finding_a_good_computer_chair_steelcase/,"I'm considering a very expensive investment on my back. I have minor scoliosis, about a 16 degree curvature. I'm 23 now, and I'm fortunate to say it has not gotten worse since I was a young teen, but I feel it affects my sitting posture in a weird way that makes me incredibly picky when it comes to chairs. When I sit for long hours, I get the classic lower back pain, sometimes tailbone pain as well as shoulder soreness. I know there is no miracle chair, but I'd like one that I can sit comfortably in that keeps good for posture for long hours.

 

I graduated college in May and will be started a new job as a software engineer in a couple weeks, and plan to make the purchase within the next month when I get paid. There is a lot of sitting in this career as it requires getting in the 'zone' for long hours. For this reason, I want to ensure that whenever I am sitting, its not completely fucking over my back, even at home. Currently I sit on a $120 AKRacing gaming chair - the most expensive chair I've ever bought, unfortunately the leather seat is deteriorating, and the bucket seat has no lumbar support.

 

During one of my internships, I found that I disliked sitting on the Herman-Miller Aerons, but at least they were better than most other chairs. I shared a nice big office with my intern buddy at the time, and we were able to grab an additional Steelcase Leap from the floor above us so I could be more comfortable. I don't recall the chair giving me an initial impressive ""wow"" factor when I sat in it or that it made me feel like a million bucks. However, it was certainly better than the Aeron for me because it reduced the back aches and I felt it had a superior seat pan. I liked the Leap V2, and ended up using it for the remaining 3 month internship.

 

Concerns/TLDR;

Is it worth $900-1000 for one of these top tier chairs at home? Is it worth considering the lower tier models from Steelcase like the Amia, Think, SILQ, etc.? How noticeable/much greater would it be of a compromise for price? I have also never sat on a Steelcase Gesture and do not know if that is a better chair than the Leap V2 for me or not. Are the seat pans of these chairs similar to thickness as the Leap V2? I'm 5'10 155lbs, although I do lift and squat, I have a stiff ass that doesn't like thin seat pans.

How to take this further?,Dob_007,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/977nyh/have_developed_feelings_for_a_friend_who_moved/,"I (27m) have developed feelings for a friend (f 25). We are in Europe. She is originally from another European country and was in my city for a an internship.

We met in spring this year in a hobby club. I always thought she was attractive and a fun person. But I was in a long distance relationship, but later that ended. Meanwhile we became very good friends over a couple of months. We have a really good chemistry. We could talk for hours and hours and I was always happy to be with her. During this time I realized that I was really into her. I wanted to confess my feelings towards her but then she told me that she might be moving away for a job opportunity. So I decided not to tell her that. But in a couple of weeks she confirmed that she will be leaving. We also used this time to bond a lot and became more closer. There was a moment I was just about to express my feelings, but seeing that how sad she was already for leaving this place. Saying goodbye to her friends. I thought it would be a bad idea to add something more to her worries. So I never confessed but was there when she needed.

Now she is in another country, it's been few weeks. Maybe she might return here after her new project has ended. We have talked on skype and we both confessed that we normally don't talk that much on calls, specially video calls to catch up and chat when we can here and there.

I think she might be into me too. But I'm not sure, as we both are kind of shy people when it comes to show our feelings. But I also don't want to misjudge her friendship to something else. 

She is quiet close to me than our other people from our hobby group. I was the first one she told that she would be leaving and asked my advice on how to tell others as she hates goodbyes. She wasn't doing well financially and never spends extra money on anything but she did buy me lunch and also dinner, even when I insisted on paying. She has told me multiple times that how much she admires me and thinks that I am a great person and other around should appropriate me. Also told me that she has never met a person like me before. 

She has brought up the relationship status up and we talked about it she told me about her previous relationships. I told her that I haven't really had a proper relationship before. But she insisted that I should be more outgoing and I should meet someone nice. She also pointed a girl from our group that maybe I should ask her out as she is beautiful and great. I told her that I didn't see that girl like that. I don't know if these are hints or what. I am silly in this sector. As I said, I don't want to misjudge friendship with flirtation.

We are in europe, so the country she went to is just a hour flight away. So I'll be visiting her very soon. Now I'm thinking of confessing my feeling to her when I'm there. I don't expect her to feel the same or give me an answer. I just want to get this out of my chest. I know this might change our friendship forever, which it will; for better or worst.

I am not sure what to do.

Also she has asked me not to book any hotel or Airbnb for my stay as I should stay at her place (she's renting a room in an appartment there) as she has an extra mattress. So I don't know, if I'm staying at her place and I confess my feeling to her during my stay, it can be super awkward if she doesn't take it well and then I have to be near her.

So I don't know how to take this further? Should I keep being friends, seeing that we are not sure about what will happen in the future. Maybe she'll find a new job in the same country she is in and stay there or might return to her home country. Maybe she will return to my country. So with all these practical reasons, should I still make a move and confess my feelings and if that goes south, might loose her as a friend. And if I do confess, how should I approach that? Considering I might me staying at her place. "

Bij deze doe ik u de antwoorden toekomen op de vragen van het lid Van Raan &amp;#40;PvdD&amp;#41; over het bericht ‘Onderzoek naar groei vliegveld Rotterdam rammelt’ &amp;#40;ingezonden 11 juli 2018&amp;#41;.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 1  
Kent u het bericht ‘Onderzoek naar groei vliegveld Rotterdam rammelt’ en het rapport ‘Second Opinion maatschappelijke kosten-batenanalyse ontwikkeling Rotterdam The Hague Airport’?    
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 1  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 2  
Kunt u bevestigen dat in de maatschappelijke kosten-batenanalyse &amp;#40;MKBA&amp;#41; voor Rotterdam The Hague Airport de kosten en nadelen voor de omgeving te laag zijn ingeschat? Zo nee, hoe zit het dan?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 2  
&amp;nbsp;    
De luchthaven Rotterdam The Hague Airport heeft op 15 maart 2016 haar groeiplannen openbaar gemaakt. Ter onderbouwing daarvan zijn door de luchthaven een Milieueffectrapport &amp;#40;MER&amp;#41; en economische onderbouwing &amp;#40;waaronder een MKBA&amp;#41; opgesteld. Ik heb uw Kamer daar eerder over geïnformeerd &amp;#40;Aanhangsel Handelingen, vergaderjaar 2015 – 2016, nr. 2019 en nr. 3546&amp;#41;. Daarbij is aangegeven dat het van cruciaal belang is dat de onderbouwing van de groeiplannen van de luchthaven goed is en dat er bestuurlijk draagvlak in de regio is ter ondersteuning van deze plannen. Mijn ministerie heeft ten behoeve van dit traject gevraagd om een toetsing van het MER &amp;#40;door de Commissie voor de m.e.r.&amp;#41; en een toetsing van de economische onderbouwing &amp;#40;door een extern bureau&amp;#41;. Beide toetsingen zijn in juni 2016 afgerond en aan de regio en de Commissie Regionaal Overleg Rotterdam aangeboden met het verzoek deze te betrekken bij het draagvlaktraject. Destijds is in opdracht van bewoners ook een onderzoek uitgevoerd naar de economische onderbouwing. Ook dit onderzoek is meegenomen in het draagvlaktraject. Inmiddels is het draagvlaktraject afgerond en heeft de regio mij een advies aangeboden. Daarover heb ik ook gesproken met de regio. Ik heb uw Kamer daarover recent geïnformeerd &amp;#40;  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ik wacht nu de aanvraag voor een luchthavenbesluit van de luchthaven af. Die aanvraag zal vergezeld gaan van een definitief MER en een definitieve economische onderbouwing &amp;#40;en MKBA&amp;#41;. Op dat moment zal ik inhoudelijk een afweging maken op basis van alle informatie die er ligt en vervolgens een ontwerp luchthavenbesluit opstellen dat in voorhang aan uw Kamer wordt aangeboden. Ik wil daar nu niet op vooruit lopen. Wel is het zo dat de luchthaven mij desgevraagd heeft meegedeeld dat zij de MKBA uit 2016 zal actualiseren en dat zij daarbij zal ingaan op de contra-expertise in opdracht van de Vereniging Bewoners Tegen Vliegoverlast Rotterdam &amp;#40;BTV&amp;#41; evenals op andere reeds uitgevoerde toetsingen. Ook in de toetsing van de economische onderbouwing die ik ten behoeve van vaststelling van het luchthavenbesluit zal doen, zal ik de reeds uitgevoerde toetsingen en contra-expertises betrekken.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 3  
Kunt u bevestigen dat in de MKBA voor Rotterdam The Hague Airport de klimaatschade door CO2-uitstoot te laag is ingeschaald? Zo nee, hoe zit het dan?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 3  
&amp;nbsp;    
De MKBA is uitgevoerd in 2015. Sindsdien is er een nieuwe richtlijn voor het waarderen van klimaatschade door CO2 opgesteld &amp;#40;CPB en PBL 2016: WLO-klimaatscenario’s en de waardering van CO2-uitstoot in MKBA’s&amp;#41;. Deze waarden liggen op lange termijn hoger in vergelijking met wat gehanteerd is in de MKBA uit 2015. Ik heb de directie van RTHA verzocht om de aangekondigde actualisatie van de MKBA uit voeren op basis van de geldende richtlijnen, zo ook voor CO2-waardering.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 4  
Kunt u bevestigen dat in de MKBA voor Rotterdam The Hague Airport voor de effecten van luchtverontreiniging de aanbevolen bandbreedte voor de onzekerheid op de gebruikte milieuprijzen &amp;#40;een factor 2&amp;#41; niet is berekend en gegeven? Erkent u dat dit een verstorend effect heeft op het uiteindelijke beeld?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 4  
&amp;nbsp;    
De MKBA is uitgevoerd in 2015. Sindsdien is er een Werkwijzer MKBA &amp;#40;2017&amp;#41; op het gebied van milieu verschenen. RTHA zal de actualisatie van de MKBA doen op basis van de geldende richtlijnen inclusief onderscheid naar –waar voorgeschreven- onder- en bovenwaarden.    
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 5  
Kunt u bevestigen dat in de MKBA voor Rotterdam The Hague Airport geen gevoeligheidsanalyse is uitgevoerd op onder andere de groeipaden van de economie, externe effecten geluidshinder, CO2 en luchtkwaliteit, terwijl dat wel aangegeven is in de toen geldende leidraad? 2&amp;#41; Erkent u dat dit een verstorend effect heeft op het uiteindelijke beeld?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 5  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ter bevordering van de consistentie en kwaliteit van MKBA’s hecht ik veel belang aan het volgen van de Algemene MKBA Leidraad. Een van de onderwerpen daarin is het hanteren van meerdere scenario’s van economische groei. Ik heb de luchthaven verzocht de actualisatie van de MKBA te doen op basis van de geldende richtlijnen &amp;#40;CPB en PBL, 2013&amp;#41; en daarvan afgeleide werkwijzers &amp;#40;RWS, Werkwijzer MKBA bij MIRT, 2018; CE Werkwijzer MKBA op het gebied van milieu, 2017&amp;#41; inclusief onderscheid naar verschillende WLO groeiscenario’s en –waar voorgeschreven- onder- en bovenwaarden. Daar waar wordt afgeweken van deze leidraden zal een onderbouwing gegeven moeten worden.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 6  
Kunt u bevestigen dat wanneer deze gevoeligheidsanalyse wel zou zijn uitgevoerd er o.a. een bandbreedte zou ontstaan van -12 tot -46,4 miljoen euro gezondheidsschade? Zo nee, hoe zit het dan? Erkent u dat de MKBA voor Rotterdam The Hague Airport hierdoor een te gunstig beeld schetst van de gezondheidsschade? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 6  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het gebruik van meerdere scenario’s en onder- en bovenwaarden van waarderingen zal zeker leiden tot een bandbreedte. Voor een beeld van de omvang van de bandbreedte verwijs ik naar de te actualiseren MKBA. Ik wil daar niet op vooruit lopen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 7  
Kunt u bevestigen dat in de MKBA voor Rotterdam The Hague Airport de kosten voor gezondheidsschade door vliegtuiglawaai enkel voor geluidhinder werden doorberekend, terwijl andere gezondheidsschade zoals de kosten van ziekteverzuim, uitkeringen, verlies van &amp;#40;werkzame&amp;#41; levensjaren en voorzieningengebruik &amp;#40;Wmo&amp;#41; niet zijn meegerekend? Zo nee, hoe zit het dan? Erkent u dat dit een incompleet beeld geeft van de gezondheidsschade? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 7  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het waarderen van gezondheid is complex. De hierboven genoemde posten separaat waarderen kan leiden tot dubbeltellingen. Ik heb de luchthaven verzocht de actualisatie van de MKBA te doen op basis van de geldende richtlijnen uit de werkwijzer MKBA bij milieu &amp;#40;CE Delft, 2017&amp;#41;.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 8  
Kunt u bevestigen dat in de MKBA voor Rotterdam The Hague Airport de opbrengsten zijn overschat? Zo nee, hoe zit het dan?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 9  
Kunt u bevestigen dat in de MKBA voor Rotterdam The Hague Airport de werkgelegenheidseffecten worden overdreven? Zo nee, hoe zit het dan?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 10  
Kunt u bevestigen dat in de MKBA voor Rotterdam The Hague Airport de ingeschatte tijd voor passagiersafhandeling te gunstig is ingeschat? Zo nee, hoe zit het dan?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 11  
Kunt u bevestigen dat in de MKBA voor Rotterdam The Hague Airport het woningwaardeverlies door geluidshinder wordt onderschat? Zo nee, hoe zit het dan?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 8 t/m 11.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Zie mijn antwoord op vraag 2.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 12  
Kunt u bevestigen dat in de MKBA voor Rotterdam The Hague Airport alleen gerekend is met een scenario van een goed draaiende economie? Zo nee, hoe zit het dan?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 12  
&amp;nbsp;    
Zowel in het MER als in de MKBA is uitgegaan van continuering van de huidige situatie &amp;#40;de referentiesituatie&amp;#41; en van situaties van lage, gemiddelde en bovengemiddelde groei van de luchtvaart. De vraag naar luchtvaart zoals uitgewerkt in de diverse groeiscenario’s hangt sterk samen met de economische situatie.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 13  
Onderschrijft u de stelling van de economen Walter Manshanden en Leo Bus dat het principieel verkeerd is dat de exploitant van de luchthaven opdrachtgever is voor de MKBA in plaats van de overheid? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 13  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ik zie daarin geen bezwaar. De luchthavens zijn de initiatiefnemers van een bepaalde voorgenomen activiteit en zij moeten dit dan ook onderbouwen en de effecten inzichtelijk maken. Ik beoordeel dat intern en laat de onderbouwing vervolgens extern toetsen. Voorts geldt dat regionale overheden en anderen in een traject op weg naar een luchthavenbesluit dergelijke analyses kritisch lezen en indien nodig op tekortkomingen wijzen.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 14  
Wat is voor u de waarde van de uitkomst van een MKBA als deze in opdracht van de initiatiefnemers van een voorgenomen ontwikkeling is uitgevoerd?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 14  
&amp;nbsp;    
Zie mijn antwoord op vraag 13.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 15  
Onderschrijft u de stelling dat de MKBA voor Rotterdam The Hague Airport onvoldoende basis biedt om een besluit te nemen over de groei van het vliegveld en moet worden herzien? Zo nee, waarom niet? Zo ja, wat is hierop uw inzet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 15  
&amp;nbsp;    
Zie mijn antwoord op vraag 2. Verder verwijs ik u naar mijn brief van juni 2018 &amp;#40;  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 16  
Bent u bereid een nieuwe MKBA uit te laten voeren naar de ontwikkeling van Rotterdam The Hague Airport? Zo nee, waarom niet? Bent u bereid om de maatschappelijke kosten en baten als gevolg van afwijkingen in vliegroutes hierin nadrukkelijk mee te nemen? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 16  
&amp;nbsp;    
Nee. Het opstellen van een economische onderbouwing &amp;#40;en als onderdeel daarvan bij voorkeur een MKBA&amp;#41; is de verantwoordelijkheid van de luchthaven, als onderdeel van de procedure om te komen tot een luchthavenbesluit. Ik laat nadat een economische onderbouwing is aangeboden een externe toetsing uitvoeren. In het geval van RTHA heeft de luchthaven aangegeven de MKBA te actualiseren.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Daarin zal in generieke zin worden ingegaan op afwijkingen van de routes, omdat bij de bepaling van de geluideffecten &amp;#40;in MER en MKBA&amp;#41; wordt gekeken hoe er in de praktijk wordt gevlogen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 17  
Wat is uw inzet om het vertrouwen van de omwonenden van Rotterdam The Hague Airport te herstellen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 17  
&amp;nbsp;    
Voor zover het vertrouwen van omwonenden van RTHA mocht zijn afgenomen, wil ik er graag op wijzen dat regionaal draagvlak voor mij uitgangspunt blijft. Ik ga ervan uit dat de regionale bestuurders verenigd in de BRR ook de belangen van omwonenden betrekken bij hun standpuntbepaling.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Met betrekking tot de fouten die zijn gemaakt in de invoergegevens van de geluidberekeningen voor het MER het volgende. Het gaat hierbij om de veronderstelde stuwkracht van specifieke vliegtuigtypes en om de veronderstelde hoogte waarop wordt gevlogen.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Ik heb organisaties van omwonenden, waaronder de Vereniging Bewoners Tegen Vliegoverlast &amp;#40;BTV&amp;#41;, reeds meegedeeld dat de Commissie Regionaal Overleg RTHA, waarin ook de omwonenden zijn vertegenwoordigd, wordt geïnformeerd over de uitkomsten van de actualisatie. Pas daarna kan de directie van RTHA een aanvraag voor vaststelling van een luchthavenbesluit indienen. De CRO zal ook worden geïnformeerd over de validatie van de actualisatie van de invoergegevens door een extern bureau.

Bij dezen doe ik u de antwoorden toekomen op de Kamervragen van het lid Laçin &amp;#40;SP&amp;#41; over het bericht dat het onderzoek naar de groei van het vliegveld Rotterdam rammelt &amp;#40;ingezonden op 10 juli 2018&amp;#41;.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 1  
Wat is uw reactie op de berichtgeving dat de conclusies van de maatschappelijke kosten-batenanalyse &amp;#40;MKBA&amp;#41; voor de uitbreiding van Rotterdam The Hague Airport &amp;#40;RTHA&amp;#41; rammelt?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 1  
&amp;nbsp;    
Daar heb ik kennis van genomen. De luchthaven Rotterdam The Hague Airport heeft op 15 maart 2016 haar groeiplannen openbaar gemaakt. Ter onderbouwing daarvan zijn door de luchthaven een Milieueffectrapport &amp;#40;MER&amp;#41; en economische onderbouwing &amp;#40;waaronder een MKBA&amp;#41; opgesteld.

Wel is het zo dat de luchthaven mij desgevraagd heeft meegedeeld dat zij de MKBA uit 2016 zal actualiseren en dat zij daarbij zal ingaan op de contra-expertise in opdracht van de Vereniging Bewoners Tegen Vliegoverlast Rotterdam &amp;#40;BTV&amp;#41; evenals op andere reeds uitgevoerde contra-expertises. Ook in de toetsing van de economische onderbouwing die ik ten behoeve van vaststelling van het luchthavenbesluit zal doen, zal ik de reeds uitgevoerde toetsingen en contra-expertises betrekken.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 2  
Kunt u per kritiekpunt van de twee economen toelichten hoe daar in het onderzoek mee is omgegaan en of de MKBA inderdaad niet een te rooskleurig beeld schetst?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 2  
&amp;nbsp;    
Zie antwoord op vraag 1.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 3  
Bent u bereid om een second opinion te laten uitvoeren op de MKBA voor de uitbreiding van RTHA? Zo ja, wanneer kan de Kamer daar de resultaten van tegemoetzien? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 3  
&amp;nbsp;    
Zie antwoord op vraag 1. In aanvulling: Het ontwerp luchthavenbesluit wordt inclusief alle onderbouwende documenten in voorhang aangeboden aan de Eerste en Tweede Kamer. Ik verwacht dit niet eerder dan in 2019.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 4  
Zijn er meer luchthavens die in het recente verleden een MKBA hebben opgesteld om uitbreidingsplannen te verantwoorden?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 4  
&amp;nbsp;    
Voor Lelystad Airport is in opdracht van het ministerie in 2014 een “Actualisatie quick scan MKBA Schiphol en Lelystad Airport Middellange termijn” opgesteld. Deze actualisatie is uw Kamer aangeboden op 13 juni 2014 &amp;#40;  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 5  
Indien het antwoord op vraag 4 ja is, bent u bereid om ook die MKBA’s aan een second opinion te onderwerpen? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 5  
&amp;nbsp;    
De luchthavens dienen ter onderbouwing van de aanvraag voor een luchthavenbesluit een economische onderbouwing op te stellen. Een MKBA kan daar onderdeel van zijn. De economische onderbouwing als onderdeel van een aanvraag tot vaststelling van een luchthavenbesluit laat ik standaard extern toetsen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 6  
Wat is uw reactie op de principiële opmerking van de beide economen dat een luchthavenexploitant niet de opdrachtgever van een MKBA zou moeten zijn, en bent u bereid om aan die werkwijze een einde te maken?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 6  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ik zie geen bezwaar in het handhaven van de huidige werkwijze. De luchthavens zijn de initiatiefnemers van een bepaalde voorgenomen activiteit en zij moeten dit dan ook onderbouwen en de effecten inzichtelijk maken. Ik beoordeel dat intern en laat de onderbouwing vervolgens extern toetsen. Voorts geldt dat regionale overheden en anderen in een traject op weg naar een luchthavenbesluit dergelijke analyses kritisch lezen en indien nodig op tekortkomingen wijzen.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 7  
Bent u bereid om met beide economen in gesprek te gaan over hun analyse van de MKBA en de Kamer te informeren over dit gesprek? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 7  
&amp;nbsp;    
Gelet op de omstandigheid dat de directie van RTHA de contra-expertise in opdracht van de BTV zal betrekken bij de actualisatie van de MKBA acht ik een dergelijk gesprek niet nodig.

977yeg,3,2018-08-14,How do you connect with people in an office environment?,MurphyBronson,AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/977yeg/how_do_you_connect_with_people_in_an_office/,"Hey fellas,

I recently completed an internship last week that was in a very busy media agency. At the start everyone was quite welcoming but very quickly I noticed everyone was also very cliquey. As the new intern I thought to myself ""Okay, I'm obviously new here and don't have a relationship amongst them yet"" so I brushed it off and continued on with my work.

Throughout the next few weeks I also noticed I was having a very hard time trying to connect with people. By nature I am an extremely confident, charismatic, and humorous person and have never had a problem making friends or meeting people but at this agency there were often times where I felt very uncomfortable and even unwelcome. There were plenty of times I even left my assigned team to go speak with others who seemed more exciting because I got the vibe my team wasn't too fond of me.

My sense of humour is definitely more out there as I'm a huge fan of podcasts like Joe Rogan, Bill Burr, Joey Diaz etc. and I definitely understand that you have to be far more careful in a professional office environment with regards as to what you say. 

But for future experience what are some good ways to subtly connect with people in an office work place? Also, how do you stay sane when the people around you are joking about the most petty and stupid stuff that is absolutely not funny and you don't want to come across as an asshole (which Im sure I did)?"

**117,146**  *Speedsters* for  **4 Years!**  


The r/FlashTV subreddit is dedicated to the American superhero television series airing on The CW. It is based on the DC Comics character Barry Allen / Flash, a costumed superhero crime-fighter with the power to move at superhuman speeds. Like with all comic book adaptations the fans are extremely passionate about their favorite hero. That passion is what makes this subreddit worth your time.


As a huge DC fan when I heard there was going to be a TV show about the Flash I was thrilled. So when I eventually started using Reddit I was very happy to find that the community was extremely welcoming and fun to be a part of. It's put a smile on my face pretty much every time I'm on the sub. 

The sub has many great features but hands down the best posts have to be the shitposts. Everyday there seems to be a brand new one that surprises the hell out of me and makes me laugh. If Shitposts aren't your cup of tea then you'll enjoy catching up on the latest episode discussions. Seeing everyone's reactions good or bad is something I look forward to every week the show is on. Whether its a shit post, discussion, theory, fan creation, multiverse..etc there is never a dull day on this sub.

 
**Here's a glimpse of some of the posts you'll find on r/FlashTV**:

[A quick moment of silence for this poor soul](https://www.reddit.com/r/FlashTV/comments/7g9w0n/a_quick_moment_of_silence_for_this_poor_soul/)

[Grant commented about Ezra Miller](https://www.reddit.com/r/FlashTV/comments/6pf61i/grant_commented_about_ezra_miller/)

[It's a Wrap](https://www.reddit.com/r/FlashTV/comments/6pf61i/grant_commented_about_ezra_miller/)

[Not fast enough,Flash.](https://www.reddit.com/r/FlashTV/comments/4m5hp6/not_fast_enough_flash/)





Now, let's hear from the mods of /r/FlashTV!
&gt;#1. What motivated you create/moderate this sub?

&gt;&gt;**u/Airsay58259**  I was asked to join the moderation team after one of the mod noticed me being often online and helping users / calling out reposts and stuff like that (nerd alert, I know). I didn't have any mod experience but I loved the show and community so I thought ""eh, why not?"". Besides there weren't many active mods back then so it was an opportunity to help. 

&gt;##What's moderating the sub like? 

&gt;&gt;**u/Airsay58259**  It's not always easy but it can be fun. I like that we have a bigger mod team since May. We have to make decisions for the subreddit as a whole even though people don't agree on everything, so that can be challenging. Some want any shitpost allowed, others are tired of shitposts and want to see less of them, for instance.
 

&gt;##What are some of your favorite posts on the sub? 

&gt;&gt;**u/Airsay58259**  I love catching up on episode discussions. That's where the best theories and jokes usually happen. As for specific posts: I love me some Caitlin's faces (which even lead to a new subreddit) and behind the scenes look at the show. We have some amazing shitposts too. 

&gt;##Do you have anything to say to the present and future subscribers?

&gt;&gt;**u/Airsay58259**  I know the subreddit used to be a lot more fun and now there's a lot of negativity since the last season(s) weren't well received. That often happens to TV shows subreddits sadly. But there's a big team of mods now making sure people keep the discussions civil and put a minimum of effort in their submissions. One thing that it seems people want more of: text posts with theories, discussion... A lot of that happens in the episode discussion threads but everyone is welcome to make text posts to discuss the shows. Unless it's to tell us Ralph Dibny was announced dead in 1x07, then you'll be greeted by wolves and I may be one of them.

&gt;##Anything else you want to add? 

&gt;&gt;**u/Airsay58259**  We created chat rooms a few weeks ago and so far it's been a positive experience for r/FlashTV in my opinion. It doesn't take away anything from the subreddit and people are pretty chill, so come and join. Starting October we'll try live episode discussions for other time zones in the chat, since it's something our international subscribers and West Coast Americans have asked for a long time but wasn't easily manageable in the subreddit with only 2 pinned posts allowed.

This might turn into a wordy post, and if it does I apologize ahead of time! I have a lot of questions that I'm hoping y'all might be able to help me with.

I'm a recent college graduate with a degree in English. I currently work a full-time job in publishing doing digital content production and management. I've been intensely interested in doing library work (especially archival preservation and management) since about half way through college, and I decided to take some time off between college and grad school to really plan out my career and educational path, since it has been pretty haphazard up to this point.

Which brings me to right now. I've started doing a lot of research on library programs and positions, and I'm seeing a lot of contradictory information. Some places say online programs are fine, others abhor them. Some say you'll find a job if you put in the work and get the internships, and others say it's luck of the draw at best. And some say that certain concentrations will be more beneficial than others.

So here are my questions (and I'm REALLY sorry ahead of time that some of them are quite broad!):

A. Is there anything that makes for a great library program? Is online school a terrible plan? My partner is in the military, so we move often. I had thought an online program would be an easy way to get my degree with his needing to move, but I don't want to compromise my job opportunities.
B. Are archives a viable career path? I realize digital management will be a necessary skill, and I'm working on learning what I can on my own/from my current job, but if the path itself isn't viable, then...
C. Are there any good tips for job placement following school? Is it about internships, or something else? 
D. I see a lot of people advising that introductory courses will tell you a lot about a program. Is this true? Should I be judging programs based off of this advice?
E. For anyone currently working in archives: (I apologize.) Have you been able to pay off loans with your position? I'm worried about ending up with incredible debt if I can't get enough financial assistance.

I really appreciate you taking the time to read my post. Tl;dr: Prospective librarian has zero clue which way to turn, so has come to Reddit to plan her life. What could go wrong?

Thank you everyone!"
978a98,348,2018-08-14,Getting fucked in the office by the college intern,winco92,gaystoriesgonewild,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaystoriesgonewild/comments/978a98/getting_fucked_in_the_office_by_the_college_intern/,"[I wrote about a cute 19 year old college intern who fucked me the same day he started working in my building.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaystoriesgonewild/comments/8tcjmp/gonna_be_a_good_summer_got_fucked_by_a_19_year/) He and I have kept fucking through the summer and have had some really hot adventures. As a reminder I'm 25, blonde and am now getting some muscle from time in the gym. He's 19 with buzzed blonde hair and looks like a frat bro. He and I are about the same height and he's kind of a selfish top which I kind of love.    

Every week he's fucked me 2-3 times. He is staying this summer with conservative relatives during his internship and they are protective of him so he only has time right after work. So I've been going into work early so I can leave early to go home and clean up before he comes over. He usually comes in, fucks, cums really quickly, and then fucks me again a second time. The first time he just took me raw and came in me without asking. It's just kind of expected now that I'm taking his load.  

About a month ago, I woke up at 6:30 to get ready for work. After I got out of the shower I saw I missed a text from him that asked if I could be ready to be fucked this morning as he woke up very horny and didn't want to jerk off. I immediately got hard and started getting cleaned up and then back in the shower. He texted me he found a storage room in his office that no one used. I was a little scared as having sex at work could be really bad if we were found out, but my dick told me I should do it so I decided to go ahead.  

I got to the office and had a hard time concentrating on work knowing that a hot 19 year old was on a floor below me wanting to fuck me. The college intern texted around 9:30 saying that everyone else in his office just went into a meeting that he wasn't invited to and he told me to meet him in the stairwell. I went down the two floors and he met me by the stair doors. We went into the office and there was a door right there that he had a key to. He opened it up and unlocked it and we went in, and then he locked the door behind. He whispered that they were going to be in the meeting for 30 minutes but he only needed a couple of minutes.    

Inside the storage room was old printers and the big old computer screens that no one uses anymore and some boxes and paper. There wasn't anywhere for me to lay down, so I hiked up my shirt and pulled down my khakis and underwear. I had a small bottle of lube with me. He immediately opened up the bottle and started lubing up my hole and got two fingers in. I had a hard time relaxing as I was about to be fucked in a public place but after a minute or two my hole started opening up and I was relaxing. He noticed it and lubed his dick up.  

I took a deep breath and felt him pushing his raw dick against my hole and I felt that familiar pop as he got in past the first ring. I was pushed up against a dusty box as this muscular 19 year old was putting his raw dick in my hole. The flourescent lights and the dust on the computer screens made it even hotter for some reason knowing that we shouldn't be doing this. He slowly went all the way  into me and found that spot in my hole that makes my knees weak. This angle felt really good with me bent over and he was rubbing right up against my prostate and I was having a really hard time not moaning. The intern always cums quickly the first time and in just a few minutes he bent fully over me and whispered he was breeding me. I felt his dick get bigger and I felt warm inside and knew he had shot a really big load in me. He pumped a few more times in and out to make sure all the cum got in me and then I felt him pull out. He had a paper towel and he cleaned up his dick and cleaned off my ass, and then he told me we should leave before we get caught. I was hoping for a second load but figured he was right.   

After I got my shirt tucked back into my pants and the intern and I checked each other to make sure that we were proper, he opened up the door and looked out and motioned for me to leave. I opened the door to the stairs and went back to work with his load in my ass. I stopped by the bathroom to push it out but another guy was in there and I didn't want him to smell the cum, so I just washed the dust from the boxes off my hands and looked in the mirror and saw my face was red and I was a little sweaty.  

I went back to my cubicle with the intern's load in my ass. I couldn't find a good time to push it out, so all day I had a semi knowing that I was loaded up and none of my coworkers knew."

97amxb,4,2018-08-14,College student looking for advice on getting into the professional world,exosoul,iOSProgramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/comments/97amxb/college_student_looking_for_advice_on_getting/,"Hello all,  

The last semester of my junior year, I took an iOS class and knew that was what I wanted to do with my CS degree. Since then, I found an internship working remotely on an app over the summer, and will be TA'ing for the Fall semesters iOS course, and I am also working on an app of my own and hope to release it within the next few months to get my feet wet with the application approval process and the app store.  

My goal is to ensure that post graduation, I will be able to find a junior developer role at a good company and things will for the most part transition smoothly. 

So my question is, if you were in my shoes at this point, what steps would you take? What should I make sure to brush up on and where should be looking? Should I start reaching out to companies that interest me now, or should I wait until the spring to start applying? 

I'm also wondering if whiteboarding is common for iOS interviews, as I hated the process when I previously interviewed for a C++ internship.  

Additionally, is it possible to work completely/partially remotely as a junior developer? I would love to stay where I am but that would mean upwards of an hour and a half commute each way to the area I am looking.  

That's pretty much it, apologies for my wall of text, and thank you for your time!"
97awb0,45,2018-08-14,"[Serious] ""Taaltrek's School For Kids Who Can't Doctor Good and Want To Do Other Things Good Too""",taaltrek,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/97awb0/serious_taaltreks_school_for_kids_who_cant_doctor/,"Some quick background, I have 8 years of experience teaching test prep. I've been full time faculty, done curriculum development, and trained new teachers. I've taught everything from the PSAT to the LSAT to the MCAT. During that time, I had the privilege of working with some amazing teachers, and while no one is perfect, I felt like in the test prep world, we were motivated to help our students learn because most of the companies I worked for paid us more money if our students were happy, and our students were happy if their scores got better. In medical school, I had a few amazing teachers, but it felt like usually, our teachers/administration were not on our side.

Anyway, I dream of opening ""Taaltrek's School For Kids Who Can't Doctor Good and Want To Do Other Things Good Too"". Here are some of my ideas:



- All modules must have a defined set of materials that questions will come from (i.e. your professors would tell you, questions will come from my slides, and this text book). 60% of all test questions for a module must come from First Aid/Uworld/Sketchy and modules will integrate specific sections of those materials
- All modules will use NBME practice subject exams in some capacity.
- Completing Uworld during pre-clinicals will be built in as a completion grade
- Students will get one on one counseling/coaching for 8 weeks during their study time for STEP 1. 
- Third year, students will have a protected total amount of time to study for shelf exams. 
-Each specialty will have designated advisors who will walk students through the application process step by step.
- Fourth year, students will have the option to study for and take STEP 3 for elective credit.



Basically, I'd like to see a medical school where the pre-clinical years focused on STEP 1 prep. I think that overall, STEP 1 isn't that important when you become a resident, but it determines your future, and it's the thing that stresses people out the most. Plus, my experience in clinical was that my pre-clinical education mostly didn't matter. 


I'd love to hear from y'all. What do you think? Am I crazy? What would you have liked to change about your medical school? I'm an intern now, and as I look back, I can't help but think that medical school didn't have to be as miserable as it was sometimes. Who knows, maybe someday we can change the system?"

I was 18 when I first fell in love with my sweet heart (let's call her V) when I was a freshman at my University. Sure I had my crushes and feelings of attraction to some girls earlier then that but V was my actual first love. We first met as friends and it took us 7 months for us to actually start dating. In those seven months we exchanged memories and details of each other's lives from past to present. We both being part of an Ivy league University of your nation , it was not hard for us to cherish discussions which required science , logic , astronomy , what not! Our frequencies were resonating on intellectual level. We both got attracted to each other soon and we started dating.

In the initial 2 years we were spending 5-6 hours every day alone time. This time included good amount of talk, spending time with each other and physical intimacy. We both were so happy with each other and it looked like nothing could stop us. But in end of my second year of University I started to spend a little time with my boys in the dorm a little more and was eventually introduced to a PC game which is a MoBA known to be highly addictive. My 5-6 hours with her every day turned into 30-40 minutes soon. I would not pick up her phone, I would lie to her at 20:00 hours telling that I'm sleeping and cannot spend time with her but go on to play my MoBA till 03:00 the next day. 

Down to the final year of my University I would spend probably 15 minutes with her and say her to go away back to her dorm (both are dorms need to walked quite a bit to reach one another). I knew that she missed my company. I did not spend time with her, talking to her , making her feel good and spending physical time with her. I knew it all but the addiction had taken over me. She tried her ways to spend time with me trying to learn my MoBA and even trying to spend time when ever possible.

I was sincerely and honestly in love with V and she was madly in love with me. We even were sure to have a bright life together with a happy, stable family. We both knew it and we had spoke about it. I may have been addicted but only I knew how much I loved her.

Soon we arrived to the final semester of my under-grad program, it was time to go to Internships. On the last day on the pen-ultimate semester we sat down and spoke about the issues we faced. I have never cheated on her and neither did she. We knew how much pure our love was to each other and how much we meant to each other. But that night last night we mutually knew our road was bumpy in recent past. That night I said to her that we were not going to be with each other anymore and I did not see ourselves together in future so we took a break for a while.

During our internships working at good firms we got good exposure and were occupied with work. It is now when I realized that when working professionally, I did not face any sort of video game addiction. That was great news for me. I went on to have a great internship, so did V (at a different firm).

Let me remind you how sincere and pure our love for each other was in former years. But during my Intern days I earned laurals at my work. At the same time she started talking about a guy she met recently at her internship. Soon they were dating. Initially for a few weeks I was cool with it because I knew we were on a break and anyways I did not provide her time earlier. Now time had come for my internship to end and slowly I got used to professional routine. Now I started the need and feel to have a person/human in my life , a companion. But I knew what was happening on her side, though she was only having flings and hookups.

Now I smiled at my past with her and started to look ahead towards my life. I met few amazing women soon. They were really good people , some smart, some attractive, what not! I dated, been in short term relationships, tried to make some long term relationships, hooked up. But the only reason I did that was because I was never happy. I was never satisfied. I didn't feel love. I know what love feels like, that was not being felt now.

I stopped dating in all forms with women because of what I was feeling. I started to feel lonely and soon fell into depression. Every day I begged for the love, which I once felt somewhere to be found. I started to die from within. I was teethotaler all my life till this point. Strong depression and loneliness hit me and I started to drink, smoke and did few drugs. Im the same guy who once promoted being sober and found intellectual/social achievements to be cool, now doing all the bad habits mentioned above.

There is not a single day now where I don't get flashes of memories of me and V together and all our moments. This only made my depression worse. To overcome this I removed her from all my social media to lessen the thoughts of her. It did help a little.

I am mildly depressed these days and am still well away from seeing any other woman. I think would not get love I wanted any time soon. I am fine with it. Last Sunday was our last day in University after being back from the internship and it was the convocation. I saw her first time again after 8 long months. I am sure she is happy and really satisfied with her life. I was totally happy to see her being happy. She had the natural glow of good life back on her now.

Last 5 minutes in the University when everyone were leaving I was  happy that we literally crossed roads once. My depression got a little less when I said Hi and she responded with a Hi and she had the happy look. I wanted wanted to ask how are you and she said bye a second later and swiftly walked away. This event, this trivial event. I do not know if she meant to be rude/ was in a hurry to leave back or just in a high energy of just being graduated. This event which is so small has been the reason I am writing today.

Post that event memory flashes of me and V flooded my brain like never even before in last 1 and half years. I started questioning myself. I knew this path. I know was going to get fucked by depression again, this time the flood was too intense and let me tell you, I cried like never before within minutes. I can assure for that in my 22 years of being alive I had never cried like yesterday. I am afraid what I'll think or do to myself if this continues. I am starting to feel mild chest pain and headache.

I know I did not spend time with her when it mattered. I know we mutually broke up. I tried to find my love again. All the past has happened and all I can control is my future.

This depression seems to not reduce at all. I am having all kinds of nasty and harmful thoughts all again now but with a greater force. I have taken 3 hours to write my story just because my body was shivering uncontrollably all this time. Today is her birthday. It made me come out and take a step to seek advice even though I never did. I am depressed to that extent.

Please , if you know how I can snap out of this, have a simple Happy and successful life kindly help me out. I just want to live and let live.  I know she's happy with whomever and where ever she is. I have no issues. But please I just want forget, I just don't want  these memories. I just want to live again, I just want to love again. Thanks you for reading.

97cqap,3,2018-08-14,Could use some advice from others suffering under the reign of an nParent,jester-count,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/97cqap/could_use_some_advice_from_others_suffering_under/,"Hi all, I've recently been dealing with a lot and I think I could use some advice from people who have been in the same boat. I am 20 and am going to be a junior at college. I live in the dorms during the school year. Lately, I have been concerned because I feel like I could break down at any time.

It's the summer now, and I've been working at an internship (that I hate, but that's not super related) for around 2 months, and will be returning to school in September. Earlier in the summer, I was home while scrounging up funds so I could pay for housing at my internship. The reason why I feel so unstable is that I feel like I can never get a ""break"". After years of enduring emotional, verbal, and at times physical abuse from my nMom, I finally came across the realization that she WAS abusing me and had an issue, and that I was not crazy. Being at school and work is helpful, but stressful in its own way. Now that I'm aware of what's going on, being at home is worse because I'm constantly on the defensive -it's very hard to try and just let it roll off your back after being affected for so long. I am always angry or upset at home because of her behavior, which has gotten markedly worse after I ""abandoned"" her for college. This defensiveness has also crept into my everyday life - even if someone means wel by it, as soon as I feel criticized I close off or become argumentative, which I hate because I feel like 90% of the time, it helps no one. Then, school and work are stressful because it feels like I must always be the best. I don't want to go home after school ends and I graduate if at all possible because I don't think I or my general mental state could take it. It feels like a life-or-death situation for me because of how bad my home life is.

(RAPE/SEXUAL ABUSE TRIGGERS PAST THIS POINT)
To add to this already huge level of stress, I have recently begun to come to terms with my trauma from sexual abuse, harassment, and rape spanning the years of age 13-17 from peers. As you could probably tell by reading all this, going to college has been immensely helpful for my mental health/self esteem, but it is also a double edged sword - on top of the stress from school and from intermittent home visits (which i try to not do if at all possible), I feel like even though I'm finally mentally able to begin to process this trauma, it is still a thorn in my side. 

I guess my point in all this is that I could use some reassurance and advice from anyone who's been in a similar spot as I am. How do I cope with my mother's worsened behavior, especially since now that I'm had some time away from her, it's tough to not fight back even though it doesn't get me anywhere? How can I begin to really recover from the abuse I have suffered at her hands (because I've tried to find resources on this, but it all seems Greek to me)? How can I reduce/handle my stress over school, home, and my future? And (if anyone has any advice or resources on this part as well) how can I go about processing my trauma in a healthy way? I know all of this is a pretty tall order. I do have a therapist, but I will be unable to see her and discuss all of this until mid-September, and to be honest I have a hard time articulating all this ""in the moment"". Thank you for reading my lengthy post!"

Along the way we will provide a support system to help you improve as a writer and expand your reach. We will work with you on branding for yourself, social media, AP style, theorizing, news coverage, breaking news, and much more. You will also get the chance to learn from and work with some solid young OWL journalists like Brandon Padilla (Seagull Man) who have found a lot of early success. 

We are specifically looking to fill these positions:

Should I finish my CAS exams?,msmncasualty,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/97d7z5/working_for_investment_company_should_i_finish_my/,"I used to be active on actuarialoutpost a few years ago but I guess I’d ask my question here to get some perspective. 

So I did my bachelor in Actuarial Science and was super passionate about becoming an actuary. I loved the work I did during internship, enjoyed learning the material and was surrounded by people who aspire to become actuaries. I passed 4 CAS exams (1,2,3F,S) in junior year just to show how committed I was to secure full time position. 

Then, I went to graduate school because I wanted to learn in depth about machine learning and AI because I was really interested in that field. I learned that my career options are broader because I have the skills to do much more than insurance space. 

Long story short, I got offered a job at an investment company as a quant and now contemplating if I should take the remaining exams to get the designation. I know it won’t help to progress my career unless I switch back to be an actuary. At the same time, I have invested so much energy time and money in those exams. Should I at least get an ACAS and stop there? 

Thanks in advance for your insights. "
97dw6z,1,2018-08-14,M4F My Ditzy Bimbo Milf Neighbor,Lastofthealts,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/97dw6z/m4f_my_ditzy_bimbo_milf_neighbor/,"* I like to set the scene before giving the general idea of the story so if you want, just skip down to the last few paragraphs *
         
“Oh my gosh thank you for coming over so fast Ben, I just texted you ” my new neighbor sandra babbled happily as she opened the door for me. She and her husband bob hand moved in a few weeks ago, and she was already my favorite neighbor if you know what I mean. At first I had thought she was just like any other smoking hot suburban milf, but she had soon disavowed me of that notion. The first giveaway was her the myriad of inappropriate outfits she as always wearing. She didn’t seem to have a sense of propriety, and she thought nothing of wearing a skimpy low cut top and skirt when she had me, the 18 year old neighbor over. 

The second thing that tipped me off was the fact that she was always having mishaps with men. Like that one time she explained that her husband didn’t let her come to his office anymore because the interns had convinced her that they had to feel her tits to prove they were real. 

“I just wanted to prove to them that their boss had a naturally hot wife, I don’t know why he was so upset. It’s not like they were trying to feel me up or anything” she had explained. Or that time she called me over, frantic because she was convinced the mole on her inner thigh might be dangerous. Now, that’s not a totally unreasonable request, but she was wearing crotchless panties when I came over to take a look. It had been pure torture as examined her, my head between her legs, the musky scent of her pussy wafting into my nostrils. 

Finally, she just wasn’t too bright all around. Like now, she had called me over because the TV wasn’t working. All it needed was to be plugged into the wall, but she didn’t realize. 

So, she was a Ditz, plain and simple. I hadn’t even tried to take advantage of her as of yet, maybe being late to puberty may have had something to do with that, but the ideas had been steadily building for the last  few weeks, and I knew I didn’t have the self control to stay pure much longer. 

*end of setting* 


Hey all. I think the general idea I’m going for is pretty clear, but I’ll do my best to explain as best I can. I don’t like the typical description of bimbo on her. It’s usually used to mean a cock hungry whore, but that’s not really it. A bimbo is a woman who is perfectly capable of enjoying sex like everyone else, but she’s a bit gullible. She loves her husband, and she recognizes the usual signs of sexual activity. For example, when someone is trying to take advantage of her she’ll usually say something like “oh, but won’t my husband be mad?” But she’s usually easily placated. So I’m looking for someone willing to play that role. If that sounds like something you’d be up for, I can wait to talk. "
97dwjx,1,2018-08-14,Do you have a lot of regrets? What triggers them?,vcardthrow1,ForeverAlone,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/97dwjx/do_you_have_a_lot_of_regrets_what_triggers_them/,"And what do you think of when you regret?

I'll start - the first ft job in the last five years I was offered was at a tiny law firm run by...an asshole. It felt *terrible* interviewing for it. I felt uncomfortable immediately - they were slick. But I'm subservient whether I fear or adore someone, so I don't think it showed, a byproduct of being passive. It's a byproduct of anxiety, continual shame, and paranoia (any time I'm late or for not doing work at the speed they expect - bosses are not subtle about who they favor). I was recommended by a friend who was a paralegal. I feel horrible about that too - I squandered her good will with idiocy. 

It was a shit job - and I was desperate. It was underpaid and gruntwork but that's what I was used to, and if I'd lasted two years, it would have made a huge difference in my life. I never felt good about it though. 

I have never seriously been considered for a role in a company where I *wanted to work*, to do a job the hiring manager took seriously. Never. 

...Their favorite attorney - this bitchy woman my age, and the woman I was replacing - hated my guts for the two weeks I lasted. Naturally she was very nice to the other small members of the team. There is nothing so horrible as working for an office of 15 people or less. It magnifies that friction, doesn't it? 

This is the trigger: Most of the personal injury law firms in this city don't survive without advertising, and they just got their first on my local news network. I'm...ugh. It's a big deal - law firms are huge, *huge* employers in my city. They must have put down a lot of money for it. 

And after a few minutes, I'm reminded....I have created a circumstance where I take choices I don't feel good about, stay, and am easy to cut loose because I have nowhere better to go.  I work for companies that look at their office staff as vermin, and hire contractors - they say the work is so important, yet won't hire perm. for it. My friends wouldn't have done the jobs I do *as fucking internships.* 


I'm 30 - I am terrified I will pay for wasting my college years for the rest of my life. I wasted a lot of time in a horrible grad school program - multiple. Multiple continuing ed. None of it, despite my best efforts or begging the program admin, was connected to employment. I'm a sucker if there ever was one, or else, lack the prerequisites to make a ""meh"" opportunity into something concrete. You know those all-but-diploma mill/publicly sponsored efforts that exist to exploit absolutely desperate people, and many things offered by a city through community colleges? That's what I'm talking about.

My alma mater was a great school - and I blew it. All the connections kids pay tuition to make, the professional network the school fed into, I just couldn't fathom, and I never really asked my advisor to help me (not that she would have - my memory of her advice about internships was a single sentence asking if I planned to intern the summer of my sophomore year, and that was that.) No one told me I would be employable if I didn't intern; no one told me I would need experience for an entry level job.

I've never had one. Not really, nothing other than horrible minimum wage childcare jobs. Shitty data entry work mostly - harder and more grueling than reception or admin, but imparting no real knowledge other than cursory usage of software. It is sneered at. 

 I don't have the GPA or work history to go back for a master's, to say nothing of the fact that I am too fucking stupid to code or really get into finance. It's taken me a year to get comfortable with basic things in excel - and without an accounting or data science degree, no one cares. Without other analytics languages - no one cares. 

I truly might as well have never gone to college and every person, every place, every horrible professional experience - every experience related to failure that I am made to experience, I'll relive later. 

Those are my regrets. I trapped myself. As stupid, as limited as I am, it was *100%* related to being FA - it is a miracle I didn't jump off of our school library, but fuck of Christ, I wish I had. The urge to kill myself was an insistent as the desire to vomit when nauseous back then, and that's how it hit. I stayed for my family and I have never stopped resenting them for it, or hating myself. 

Nothing I try matters and untold humiliations (e.g., lots of free labor - weekend classes just to master, like, fucking pivot tables...on top of *horrible*, underpaid jobs and jobs I knew would be a risk to my mental health, b/c it was that or nothing) were endured, but I am...two decades behind the average 22 year old leaving college these days, and especially mine. The pressures put on young people look worse than ever. What the fuck are people supposed to do if no one lets them intern? What the fuck are people supposed to do if they can't afford to work unpaid to get ""experience"", an abuse still heartily, giddily practiced by companies? 

...I say all this but I'd still trade places with a reasonably good looking 20-something who had some fair professional experience than be me - flotsam and jetsam, human garbage clutching a degree that's garbage to me too. 

What do you regret, and what triggers it, FA? (I know a lot of these will be ""my one chance to date"" - I'm looking for other stuff too. A friend you lost, that you remember whenever you see something they loved, hear a song...etc. An opportunity you missed - to do what? Something you once loved in the past that was spoiled by....what?) 

Does anything open the wound anew? 

Do you think you'll get a chance to outlive it? 

...I'm really trying and it's really fucking pathetic, so I can't for myself. I hope so.

I hope some day I will have something resembling a career, with a path, and a comfortable salary - and have enough work history and skill that if I have a boss that treats me like shit, or coworkers I don't like - I can leave easily for another job, find it reasonably, and then give my notice.  My one friend at the job I'm at now did it. I took over his work - mountains and mountains of shitty gruntwork. 

I hope I become someone my boss actually *likes*, instead of tolerates, and to be worthy of the favor of bosses I am bound to like. I've seen it - I've seen bosses talk to their employees like *friends*. Real friends. People they seem to want to know as full human beings.

I have not really been in a place where I can engage people holistically since college, and I was *miserable* there. Miserable. 

I hope I will have enough peace of mind that I'll stop feeling like I'm trying to get to the surface with the anchor of my own failures attached to me, brought to mind by....ads with bosses that made me feel exactly as I expected them to. Offices therein - whole blocks and neighborhoods of my city are plagued by bad memories. Firings, horrible interviews, the horrible grad school I went to...places I know lost friends are working, people I'll never see again who cut me out of their lives. If you fuck up enough, if you're enough of a loser - the whole planet becomes a purgatory where you can relive it over and over. 

Things lost I'll never retrieve, not only because the world moves out without people like us - but really, truly *lost*, as a direct result of the person this last decade reduced me to. 

What's more important than your job in America, unless you have a great hobby to compensate for being a loser? What's taken as a greater totem of adulthood, or the value people attribute to you, of your skill or worth as a human being? 


If you relate, I'm listening. "
97dyga,54,2018-08-14,Passed ICND1 - Job offer within two weeks,clapbackmush,ccna,https://www.reddit.com/r/ccna/comments/97dyga/passed_icnd1_job_offer_within_two_weeks/,"I know other people are in the same boat as me so I wanted to share my experience so others can draw from it as well.

I have 0 background experience in IT, my work history has been in healthcare. I decided that I wanted a change and chose to pursue the CCNA certification and my goal was to work in IT. I studied for the ICND1 and passed July 31st. After I passed I updated my resume and started to put out applications to different job postings that I thought I had a realistic shot at at least landing an interview.

Surprisingly enough I was able to land two interviews at two different companies. The first interview was with a tech-oriented company in my area for a Level 1 help-desk support position. I was interviewed by two gentlemen who did not seem to be interested in hiring me at all. They asked me several questions, talked about the possibility of doing a paid internship but it seemed like they really wanted someone with experience. I never heard back from them. I was disappointed because I knew I could've interviewed better but it seemed like their mind was made up before the interview even had a chance to get going. 

I got back home and continued to put more applications. I saw a job posting for a LAN/WAN support analyst that I was sure I was under-qualified for but saw that they had CCENT certification under the section of preferred qualifications so I gave it a shot. The company called me back within a few days and set me up with an interview with two IT managers.

This interview had the entire opposite vibe from the first one. I was asked basic interview questions, a few technical questions (some that I even did not know the answer too) and they told me more about the company, the position and the training involved. The next day I was called back, asked if I was still interested and given a formal offer. I start in two weeks.

I wanted to share my experience because I know there are others out there wondering if the CCENT will get you a job. The job I have gotten may not be the most sought after or the highest paying (it's more than my current job in the healthcare field) but it's a foot in the door and a start in the IT field. So for those who are studying and looking for a little motivation, I hope you are able to draw from my experience and use it to power you through your studies.

97e3ld,73,2018-08-14,169Q/166V/6.0AWA. ~4 weeks study time while working a full time job. Here is what I did.,bigbigbotboy,GRE,https://www.reddit.com/r/GRE/comments/97e3ld/169q166v60awa_4_weeks_study_time_while_working_a/,"Hi all. Posting as this may help people in a similar situation. Feel free to ask any questions.

**My background:** Rising 4th year undergraduate computer science major at a top25 university in the US.

I registered for the GRE at the end of July, took my GRE at the beginning of August. This was my first time taking the test.

My long term goal is a PhD in computer science.

**Studying**

I was working full time doing a software engineering internship during my entire study period. This meant I had only a few hours after work each day of free time to study.

The following is a rough idea of how I spent my time. I did not study every single night. I would say I studied 4-5 nights per week on average, gradually decreasing studying frequency as I got closer to the test.


**Throughout**: I ride the bus for about 50 minutes total per day to get to/from work. I spent this time learning vocab on the Magoosh GRE Vocab app. This was enough time for me to complete all of the Basic &amp; Common vocab word sets. I did not touch the advanced words. 

**Week1-2**: I downloaded a PDF and read through the ETS GRE official prep book. I read every single section, and did the practice sections at the end of each section as I went along. This took me about 1.5 weeks. I did not do any practice writing yet.

After finishing all of the material, I took practice test sections after coming home from work, i.e. both of the quant sections or both the verbal sections from a practice test. At this point I still only used the ETS GRE prep book.

I was scoring 168+ in quant, so I identified that my quant scores were fine, I did not need much deliberate practice. Most of my quant work was familiarizing myself with the format of the test and reviewing geometry. 

In the verbal section I was scoring ~162-163. I identified that most of my points were missed due to vocabulary.

Also, any time I got a question wrong on a practice test, I looked at the solution explanation in the back of the book and made sure I understood why I got it wrong.

**Week 3**: Practiced AWA by doing the practice prompts from the GRE ETS book and using the online prompt pools. I read all of the 6 and 5 score responses that were provided by ETS, which is just those in the book and online, I believe.

To practice writing myself, I started off by compiling a ~6 page word doc that contained advice/tips on how to score high on AWA. It included excerpts from several posts from this subreddit as well as Kaplan's guide on AWA. I read the relevant tips from this paper every time before I practiced writing. My goal was to ingrain these things in my head so that they would be subconsciously there whenever I did AWA writing. I spent the first few nights just writing with no timer. I have a natural aversion to standardized writing tests, so this was a way for me to break through that aversion and feel more comfortable writing. After that, I wrote with the timer and got used to writing in the time constraint. This was a bit challenging, but by the end of the week I had a solid routine for every 30 minute writing block. Here was my strategy:

1. Spend the first ~5 minutes writing down anything you think of in response to the prompt. Organize your thoughts into logical points that you will later turn into paragraphs.
2. Write the body first. The introduction and conclusion are not nearly as important as the contents. I always wrote the body, then the introduction, then the conclusion. In fact, on the actual GRE, I ran out of time to write the conclusion on my issue task, but I guess it turned out fine.
3. Tack on the introduction and conclusion as rough rehashes of the prompt and the body. Include a thesis in your introduction.
4. Reread with whatever time you have left and modify anything you don't like. In truth, I always barely left myself time to reread my writing. Sometimes I did not have time to reread the entire thing, just parts. If you can write coherently the first time, you may find that saving time to reread your writing is not that useful.

**Week 4**: This is the week before the test. Monday and Tuesday I took the 2 free powerprep ETS GRE practice tests online, each in one sitting, one per night. Wednesday-Friday all I did was review vocab on the Magoosh app, starting from the very beginning, since I did not remember a lot of the words I learned from the beginning. I was able to review all the basic sets, but didn't get to review the commons. At this point I was not stressing about the test, sleeping 10 hour nights, just resting my mind and body for the test, and not trying to learn new things.

**In total**: I took 4 practice GREs (2 in full, one sitting sessions; 2 by doing them one half per night). I wrote about 8 issue tasks and 6 argument tasks. I studied 600-800(?) words, not sure exactly how many.

So yeah, not sure if I left anything out, but feel free to ask any questions. Hope this helps someone!"

97eyoa,5,2018-08-14,"I (25M) am in love with my friend's (24M) ex-girlfriend (27F) who broke up due to the former ""cheating"" on her.",InigoMarz,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/97eyoa/i_25m_am_in_love_with_my_friends_24m_exgirlfriend/,"Hello everyone. A bit of a long story, so hope you have the time to read. I am from the Philippines for added information.

Around 2014, I underwent internship when I was graduating from my undergrad studies, as it is a pre-requisite to graduate. I met one of the employees of the establishment I worked for and she was really sweet, and I had a crush on her, but then it started to developing into an infatuation of sorts. However, obviously, as a student it's not advisable to enter into a relationship with the employee of the company, so I was content with staying as friends. However, a close friend of mine who also had his internship at the same company started developing feelings for her. Again, in my case it was just infatuation, but seeing as my friend is driven into courting her, I let him be as a show of respect and I supported him in that endeavor.

The two became boyfriend and girlfriend after my friend and I both graduated from college. Both were really in love with one another and I can't help but be happy for them. I would catch up with his girlfriend (now ex) from time to time and ask how they are doing since my friend was actually during the time unresponsive to my messages ever since he had a love life. 

While I still had feelings for the girl during the time, I just controlled it and respected distance by minimal interaction with them, so as not to create some sort of rift in the relationship. I don't want to break the friendship that I have built up with them for some time, so I respected their relationship and was supportive of them all throughout.

Around early 2018, the man moved to Canada to join with his mother, who was working a job there and actually their relationship was still intact for a while despite the long distance relationship.

However, sometime around the same year, I started seeing posts of the woman, posting quotes that relate to heartbreak and moving on. Of course, I was intrigued and wanted to know what happened, because their relationship was so tight during the time, and I wanted to know what went down. 

According to her, the man ""cheated"" on her with another woman. Whether it was before he left for Canada or during his stay there, I do not know. This was shocking to me because of two things: (1) their relationship was so tight that I thought that they would not break up, and (2), I know the man well enough that he is not capable of cheating on her because, as we say in our language, ""torpe"", a term that we use to describe someone who is shy of the opposite sex. So it was hard on who I should believe in. I did not ask her ex as he does not see me as a friend anymore. 

As we talked about what happened, our relationship with one another started to grow closer. We would talk more than we were often accustomed to, because when she was in a relationship still with her ex, I had a hard time interacting with her because her ex was jealous of me talking to her, but I respected their relationship during the time because her ex is a close friend of mine, and I didn't intend to take him away from her. She and I were just good friends just as I was good friends with him. He was actually always possessive of her even before they became a couple. She would tell me that he was jealous of me during our internship days because I would be talking to her often, but I had no intention of courting her during the time. 

But now that she is single, it has been maybe 5-6 months since their breakup, and while I do have intentions of courting her, I just don't want to soil the relationship that I have with her ex, and at the same time I want to keep the friendship that the woman and I have; as close friends. Unfortunately, her ex doesn't see me as a friend anymore because he already knows my intentions. 

However, I am already in love with this woman. Unlike the others I have met, I just seem comfortable talking to her. Like anything under the sun, and it just comes out naturally when we talk with one another. Any topic, we can talk about and even have a few laughs about it. 

Currently, she is working in Abu Dhabi and will return to the Philippines in around 2 years. Anyway, I would just like to seek for advice because I want to court her, yet at the same time, I want to make amends with her ex who I used to hang out with a lot back in college. I am afraid that if we ever become a couple, it may ruin any chances that I have in making peace with my friend."

I was 18 when I first fell in love with my sweet heart (let's call her V) when I was a freshman at my University. Sure I had my crushes and feelings of attraction to some girls earlier then that but V was my actual first love. We first met as friends and it took us 7 months for us to actually start dating. In those seven months we exchanged memories and details of each other's lives from past to present. We both being part of an Ivy league University of your nation , it was not hard for us to cherish discussions which required science , logic , astronomy , what not! Our frequencies were resonating on intellectual level. We both got attracted to each other soon and we started dating.

In the initial 2 years we were spending 5-6 hours every day alone time. This time included good amount of talk, spending time with each other and physical intimacy. We both were so happy with each other and it looked like nothing could stop us. But in end of my second year of University I started to spend a little time with my boys in the dorm a little more and was eventually introduced to a PC game which is a MoBA known to be highly addictive. My 5-6 hours with her every day turned into 30-40 minutes soon. I would not pick up her phone, I would lie to her at 20:00 hours telling that I'm sleeping and cannot spend time with her but go on to play my MoBA till 03:00 the next day. 

Down to the final year of my University I would spend probably 15 minutes with her and say her to go away back to her dorm (both are dorms need to walked quite a bit to reach one another). I knew that she missed my company. I did not spend time with her, talking to her , making her feel good and spending physical time with her. I knew it all but the addiction had taken over me. She tried her ways to spend time with me trying to learn my MoBA and even trying to spend time when ever possible.

I was sincerely and honestly in love with V and she was madly in love with me. We even were sure to have a bright life together with a happy, stable family. We both knew it and we had spoke about it. I may have been addicted but only I knew how much I loved her.

Soon we arrived to the final semester of my under-grad program, it was time to go to Internships. On the last day on the pen-ultimate semester we sat down and spoke about the issues we faced. I have never cheated on her and neither did she. We knew how much pure our love was to each other and how much we meant to each other. But that night last night we mutually knew our road was bumpy in recent past. That night I said to her that we were not going to be with each other anymore and I did not see ourselves together in future so we took a break for a while.

During our internships working at good firms we got good exposure and were occupied with work. It is now when I realized that when working professionally, I did not face any sort of video game addiction. That was great news for me. I went on to have a great internship, so did V (at a different firm).

Let me remind you how sincere and pure our love for each other was in former years. But during my Intern days I earned laurals at my work. At the same time she started talking about a guy she met recently at her internship. Soon they were dating. Initially for a few weeks I was cool with it because I knew we were on a break and anyways I did not provide her time earlier. Now time had come for my internship to end and slowly I got used to professional routine. Now I started the need and feel to have a person/human in my life , a companion. But I knew what was happening on her side, though she was only having flings and hookups.

Now I smiled at my past with her and started to look ahead towards my life. I met few amazing women soon. They were really good people , some smart, some attractive, what not! I dated, been in short term relationships, tried to make some long term relationships, hooked up. But the only reason I did that was because I was never happy. I was never satisfied. I didn't feel love. I know what love feels like, that was not being felt now.

I stopped dating in all forms with women because of what I was feeling. I started to feel lonely and soon fell into depression. Every day I begged for the love, which I once felt somewhere to be found. I started to die from within. I was teethotaler all my life till this point. Strong depression and loneliness hit me and I started to drink, smoke and did few drugs. Im the same guy who once promoted being sober and found intellectual/social achievements to be cool, now doing all the bad habits mentioned above.

There is not a single day now where I don't get flashes of memories of me and V together and all our moments. This only made my depression worse. To overcome this I removed her from all my social media to lessen the thoughts of her. It did help a little.

I am mildly depressed these days and am still well away from seeing any other woman. I think would not get love I wanted any time soon. I am fine with it. Last Sunday was our last day in University after being back from the internship and it was the convocation. I saw her first time again after 8 long months. I am sure she is happy and really satisfied with her life. I was totally happy to see her being happy. She had the natural glow of good life back on her now.

Last 5 minutes in the University when everyone were leaving I was  happy that we literally crossed roads once. My depression got a little less when I said Hi and she responded with a Hi and she had the happy look. I wanted wanted to ask how are you and she said bye a second later and swiftly walked away. This event, this trivial event. I do not know if she meant to be rude/ was in a hurry to leave back or just in a high energy of just being graduated. This event which is so small has been the reason I am writing today.

Post that event memory flashes of me and V flooded my brain like never even before in last 1 and half years. I started questioning myself. I knew this path. I know was going to get fucked by depression again, this time the flood was too intense and let me tell you, I cried like never before within minutes. I can assure for that in my 22 years of being alive I had never cried like yesterday. I am afraid what I'll think or do to myself if this continues. I am starting to feel mild chest pain and headache.

I know I did not spend time with her when it mattered. I know we mutually broke up. I tried to find my love again. All the past has happened and all I can control is my future.

This depression seems to not reduce at all. I am having all kinds of nasty and harmful thoughts all again now but with a greater force. I have taken 3 hours to write my story just because my body was shivering uncontrollably all this time. Today is her birthday. It made me come out and take a step to seek advice even though I never did. I am depressed to that extent.

Please , if you know how I can snap out of this, have a simple Happy and successful life kindly help me out. I just want to live and let live.  I know she's happy with whomever and where ever she is. I have no issues. But please I just want forget, I just don't want  these memories. I just want to live again, I just want to love again. Thanks you for reading.

97fr7p,1,2018-08-15,I want to discuss NASA OSSI/ Force (as opposed to Pathways).,oSovereign,nasa,https://www.reddit.com/r/nasa/comments/97fr7p/i_want_to_discuss_nasa_ossi_force_as_opposed_to/,"So recently I got a position for a Fall internship through the new NASA Force system (which appears to have replaced OSSI). I was and still am extremely excited and happy to have the position, but as I've read on I have become increasingly dismayed that this position does so little to actually get a foot in the door for NASA full-time positions.

What I have found to be a nice justification is that the work I will be doing is, at least in theory and based on discussing with my mentor, highly technical and directly related to what I want to work on for graduate school. This still does little to ease my mind as I feel like I am not getting the full experience without being in the Pathways program.

I want to ask some questions and discuss some things for those that have the time:

1) What are some things I can do to become more competitive for Pathways or full-time work? What type of events should I focus on while I am there? What even are my chances of getting an opportunity such as that off of activity in this internship?

2) How is the NASA OSSI/ Force program viewed by other companies in the aerospace industry? Will this be a good talking point for applications to companies such as SpaceX, Boeing, Lockheed/ Northrop/ Raytheon, etc.? Or will they be disappointed to see that it is an OSSI/ Force position and not a Pathways position? On that note, how useful is this opportunity for graduate school applications?

3) My career path is going to involve a master's and most likely a PhD, so I am wondering what the typical path is for someone going this route? Is it still possible to pursue Pathways or some other opportunity after getting your Bachelor's? How does NASA normally handle these situations, because it seems like a lot of people just go on to become full-time civil servants right after their Bachelor's which obviously won't work for me."

Initially for a few weeks I was cool with it because I knew we were on a break and anyways I did not provide her time earlier. Now time had come for my internship to end and slowly I got used to professional routine. Now I started the need and feel to have a person/human in my life , a companion. But I knew what was happening on her side, though she was only having flings and hookups.

Now I smiled at my past with her and started to look ahead towards my life. I met few amazing women soon. They were really good people , some smart, some attractive, what not! I dated, been in short term relationships, tried to make some long term relationships, hooked up. But the only reason I did that was because I was never happy. I was never satisfied. I didn't feel love. I know what love feels like, that was not being felt now.

I stopped dating in all forms with women because of what I was feeling. I started to feel lonely and soon fell into depression. Every day I begged for the love, which I once felt somewhere to be found. I started to die from within. I was teethotaler all my life till this point. Strong depression and loneliness hit me and I started to drink, smoke and did few drugs. Im the same guy who once promoted being sober and found intellectual/social achievements to be cool, now doing all the bad habits mentioned above.

There is not a single day now where I don't get flashes of memories of me and V together and all our moments. This only made my depression worse. To overcome this I removed her from all my social media to lessen the thoughts of her. It did help a little.

I am mildly depressed these days and am still well away from seeing any other woman. I think would not get love I wanted any time soon. I am fine with it. Last Sunday was our last day in University after being back from the internship and it was the convocation. I saw her first time again after 8 long months. I am sure she is happy and really satisfied with her life. I was totally happy to see her being happy. She had the natural glow of good life back on her now.

Last 5 minutes in the University when everyone were leaving I was  happy that we literally crossed roads once. My depression got a little less when I said Hi and she responded with a Hi and she had the happy look. I wanted wanted to ask how are you and she said bye a second later and swiftly walked away. This event, this trivial event. I do not know if she meant to be rude/ was in a hurry to leave back or just in a high energy of just being graduated. This event which is so small has been the reason I am writing today.

Post that event memory flashes of me and V flooded my brain like never even before in last 1 and half years. I started questioning myself. I knew this path. I know was going to get fucked by depression again, this time the flood was too intense and let me tell you, I cried like never before within minutes. I can assure for that in my 22 years of being alive I had never cried like yesterday. I am afraid what I'll think or do to myself if this continues. I am starting to feel mild chest pain and headache.

I know I did not spend time with her when it mattered. I know we mutually broke up. I tried to find my love again. All the past has happened and all I can control is my future.

This depression seems to not reduce at all. I am having all kinds of nasty and harmful thoughts all again now but with a greater force. I have taken 3 hours to write my story just because my body was shivering uncontrollably all this time. Today is her birthday. It made me come out and take a step to seek advice even though I never did. I am depressed to that extent.

Please , if you know how I can snap out of this, have a simple Happy and successful life kindly help me out. I just want to live and let live.  I know she's happy with whomever and where ever she is. I have no issues. But please I just want forget, I just don't want  these memories. I just want to live again, I just want to love again. Thanks you for reading.

97hoxo,2,2018-08-15,Advice needed - Language school while doing part time work... Anyone done this?,RedRhino10,movingtojapan,https://www.reddit.com/r/movingtojapan/comments/97hoxo/advice_needed_language_school_while_doing_part/,"Hi all,

(Repost from r/Japan, this is a better thread for my question!)

I've been looking at the possibility of studying Japanese abroad while doing part time work (as probably some kind of Eikawa or ALT position)

I have saved enough money from part time work and a work internship that I took part in this year, so I can actually afford the school fees... But I would need to earn more while working to last a full year. I have enough for 6 months living costs, or I expect I'd be able to reach the full 12 months with a part-time job.

From what I've read online, many have been able to reach N2 within a year of studying in Japan, but it's unclear how many also did work during this time? I think as a native English speaker I have more options, but has anyone worked in other places while studying (like bars, restaurants, hotel's etc)?

Here's a bit about me, in case anyone is/was in a similar position to me!
&gt; Will have BEng degree next July.

&gt; Keen to work in Tokyo as a IT developer/UI designer in the future.

&gt; Currently (unexamined) working around N4 level

&gt; Native English speaker, would be willing to take an online TEFL course this year during my final year studies.

Please be Direct and Honest! I will listen to advise from others. My money has been hard earned, so I don't intend to waste literally my entire lifes savings on this unless it's worth it. Also making efforts to connect with employers and companies so I can actively look for well paid work after completing a year's study.

TL;DR Is Studying Japanese while doing part time job possible or not? If so, is it worth it for applying for full time graduate jobs afterwards?"

&gt;&gt;**/u/Xalaxis** - Moderating the subreddit is generally very quiet, but when there is an argument things can heat up fast. This doesn't happen often however, and I imagine it's a situation similar on all popular subreddits. The development of /u/WikiHowLinkBot with /u/Improbably_Wrong 's help has cut our moderation demand by at least 80%.

97iubx,4,2018-08-15,CS major looking for direction on finding an internship or other advice after recently changing majors and not having as much time as others,thelamppole,Austin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/97iubx/cs_major_looking_for_direction_on_finding_an/,"I was a nursing major but before starting my first semester I thought I might want to switch to CS. During my first semester of nursing school I took a python class and decided to make the switch because I never realized my love for technology could actually be a career path. 

Now I’m in a position that I have almost every pre req completed so I’ll be graduating in 2 years. But I understand most CS students don’t have the bet luck in finding first year internships. As I would have to apply soon for next year with no classes. 

Would it maybe be best to find research opportunities with my professors vs an internship? Or maybe try to apply late and squeeze into a small internship? I just didn’t think I’d have any luck in the  2019 summer finding one without any real CS semesters under my belt yet. 

TLDR: I have changed my major recently and will be graduating soon but can’t apply for internships without any experience. What’s my best step? "
97j53l,338,2018-08-15,The college intern shared me with one of his friends,winco92,gaystoriesgonewild,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaystoriesgonewild/comments/97j53l/the_college_intern_shared_me_with_one_of_his/,"[I've wrote about a college intern that is working in the same office building](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaystoriesgonewild/comments/8tcjmp/gonna_be_a_good_summer_got_fucked_by_a_19_year/). 2-3 times a week the college intern comes over right after work, fucks me hard and fast, and goes home all in 20 minutes. He cums really quick the first time and then takes another 10-15 minutes on the second fuck.  He's not only really cute, but I also find his attitude really hot. He knows that I want dick and so he gives it to me. He never asked if I wanted a condom or his load and just breeds me. It's been a really hot summer and fun summer and [I am still just writing about some of our experiences like him fucking me in the office](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaystoriesgonewild/comments/978a98/getting_fucked_in_the_office_by_the_college_intern/).  

He fucked me on Thursday. After he bred me, he asked if I could be home early from work at 4pm tomorrow on Friday.  I said yeah I could go into work even earlier than normal and he said good and that his friend was coming in on a bus around 345 and would uber to my house. I asked him what he meant and he said a friend was visiting him for the weekend and wanted to get laid and the college intern told his friend he had a bottom that would take his dick. I felt my face getting red. This cocky intern didn't even ask if I wanted to get fucked by his friend but just assumed I would. I was kind of annoyed but got really hard as I was thinking of him telling his friend about my hole so I said okay I'd be home at 4pm. I asked what the guy looked like and the college intern said I would like him and that he had to go.  

On Friday I sent the college intern a couple of texts asking for pictures of his friend and he kept saying he would send them but then didn't. I was hard most of the day thinking that a random college guy was going to be coming to my apartment to fuck me and I didn't even know what he looked like.  

At 4pm I opened up the door and there was a really hot looking white guy wearing shorts and a tshirt. He looked me up and down and asked if I was winco, and when I said yes he got a big smile and just came inside my apartment.  He was about six feet tall and with brown hair and didn't have any facial hair. He asked for a drink so I mad ehim a vodka soda and I made it for him while he was peeing. He came back in the kitchen with his dick out of his shorts and was already hard. I was a little embarassed by this as I didn't know his name and now his cut 6 inch dick was  right in front of me.    

I made eyes with him and I could see his horniness. I got on my knees in front of him and got right in front of his dick. I was really horny and very slowly rubbed my tongue around his dickhead. I looked up and we stared at each other as I got his dickhead all the way in my mouth and then slowly went down all the way on his dick. I kept slowly looking up at him and licking his dick. Only after 30 seconds he stopped me and said that he was already getting close. I just smiled and went to suck on his balls. I asked him if he could cum twice and he said yes, so I slid my mouth back on his dick. He told me immediately he was getting close, and I just looked up at him and kept slowly sucking him. He said he was going to cum and I grabbed his legs and kept sucking him. I felt the first jet of cum in my mouth and I started moaning. His entire body shook.  

I took him into the bedroom, got him completely naked and he was still mainly hard, and I got back on my knees. Knowing that 19 year old guys are good at cumming quickly, cumming often and fucking, I didn't expect him to really do much foreplay. I tried kissing him and he didn't want to go for it, so I instead went back to sucking his dick and started lubing up my own hole. I had condoms out beside the bedside table. When he was rock hard again I asked if he wanted to fuck me and he said yeah. I handed him a condom and I grabbed the lube and he asked if it was true I didn't use condoms with his friend the college intern. I said no and he said he wanted to fuck me raw too. I lubed up his dick with silicon lube and got on my stomach.  

He tried going in too quickly and I made him stop and slow down as I got used to his dick. I took a few deep breaths and told him to go slow and he pushed slowly and got all the way in. I felt my hole opening up and letting him in, and I got that famimliar feeling of being really full. He was completely laying on my body and I pushed up a little bit so my knees were bent and my back was arched and I told him to fuck me slow at first. He started fucking me. He was a little clumsy and it didn't seem like he had much practice but it felt really good.  

I flipped over onto my back as when I'm getting fucked by hot guys I love watching them and seeing their body. He didn't seem to know what to do so I pulled my legs up and he got the idea he was supposed to fuck missionary. I guided his dick into my hole and he pushed all the way in. He found something in my hole that most guys don't and I couldn't help but moan really loudly. I looked up and saw this really hot stranger bare fucking my hole and I felt real slutty. Even though he didn't kiss before, I pulled his face towards mine and he closed his eyes and started making out with me. His kissing technique showed not that much experience either which made it hotter.  

I pulled away from his face again so I could not concentrate on the making out and just focus on the feeling of his dick in my hole. He started getting really aggressive with my hole and was fucking me really hard. He told me he was getting close to cumming. I loved watching his muscular body fucking me as he was jackhammering into my ass. He was moaning really loud and pulled his dick all the way out of me and started jerking off. I yelped as I wanted his load and I grabbed his body and told him to get his dick back in my hole. His eyes got real big and he slammed his dick back into my now loose hole and just let out a yell and I could feel warmth in my hole and knew he had cum.  

I was jerking off with his dick still inside me and was about to cum when I heard a knock at my apartment door. Fuck. Bad timing.  

I had the guy pull out of me and I wrapped a towel around me and looked through the eyehole at the door. It was the college intern. I opened up and the college intern just laughed at me as he saw I was in a towel with a hard dick. I went back into the bedroom and told the friend to go shower and gave him a clean towel.    

Back in the living room my regular college intern asked if I showed his friend a good time, and he made me drop my towel and he asked to feel my hole. He laughed and said it felt cum-filled and asked if his friend used a condom and I told him no. The college intern told me it was hot I took his friends load. I asked if he was going to fuck me too and he said that was kind of weird to fuck me with cum from his friend in me, but then he took out his dick and told me to suck him off really quick while his friend was in the shower. He said we didn't have much time so do it really quick.    

I still heard the shower running when I went to suck him. After ten seconds he said fuck it and turned me around and slid into me in one stroke. He fucked really hard for only about 30 seconds and I heard his familiar body sighs as he tightened up and I knew he was breeding me. Still really horny I turned around and sucked the remaining cum off his dick as I started to jerk off. In just a few strokes I came a huge load over the floor as I tasted silicon lube and cum from two guys on his dick. With his dick now clean, he put his dick back in his pants as I heard the shower turn off.   

His friend came out and the two of them left. I had to jerk off again immediately.  "
97jjon,4,2018-08-15,How to job? (Tldr; at end),sweetpotfries,CasualConversation,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/97jjon/how_to_job_tldr_at_end/,"I'm going to graduate college this upcoming March, which I guess is a little ways away. I've been applying to lots and lots of jobs in hopes that I find something for after I graduate, but nothing. I've sent out like 50+ applications and literally nothing but rejection, which doesn't really bring me down (because when I was applying for internships I must've sent out 200+ applications and only got 3 real offers), but I am very concerned about not being able to find a job.

I've heard that right now is too early to apply for jobs, &amp; also that it's never too early to apply for jobs. I'm looking for jobs near/in a big city, mostly throughout the US (NYC, Boston, Seattle, SF, Chicago, East Coast in general, LA, etc.) but I'm also okay with living out of the country in/near a big city as well (just immigration is tough).

I was hoping to get some job searching/applying/interviewing suggestions (supportive advice only please)!! I also have no idea what sort of jobs are out there with my skill set, so recommendations from that would be awesome! And if you know a place hiring that needs this sort of employee, I would love to hear about it.

My background:

* Will graduate from a University of California school with a Business Management Economics degree (we focus on business, economics, accounting, calculus, econometrics/stats, computer literacy) but I started out as a Computer Science major for two years, so I know a decent bit of programming. Low GPA
* Two summer marketing internships - one in the fashion industry, one in the electric vehicle industry (website/email wireframing, social media marketing, analytics, blogs, market and business research)
* Teaching an Intro to Java class to female students

Thank y'all so much!

Tldr; I'm graduating soon and I can't find a job with my skillset. Need help. Thanks :)"

**Ultimatum** - Major (Varying AP)										
										
Ultimatum - Major (Varying AP) Varst manifests a 12ft greatsword in front of him. The sword cleaves through opponents all around him, leaving injuries akin to burns. 

Effect: Attack with [Semblance + Resolve] against opponent’s [Resolve]. Can attack up to [Aura Spent/2] targets up to 4 tiles away. Immediately after use, Varst loses all aura armor and drops to 1 AHP.											
										
										
										
										
										
										
										
#**Physical Description**										
										
   Varst has a good head of curtain cut black hair that slightly covers his forehead. His face has a rectangular shape with a subtly defined jawline that extends into a flat chin. Varst’s eyes are a deep blue color, and are spaced neatly under well slightly bushy eyebrows. In between the eyes is a small pinched nose that hangs over his thin lips.

   Standing at about 5'8"" and weighing 190lbs, Varst has a well-built body from his travels and training. His muscles aren't particularly defined, slightly larger than average but not bursting at the skin. His skin is pale and burns incredibly easily.				
					
   Varst wears a grey cowl top with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows, and black pants that cover his grey work boots. He has an orange cape tied onto his cowl, cut off at his waist in a circular arc. Inscribed on the back of the cape is He has an armored glove on his left hand so he can safely detach Echtheid’s blade, but his right hand is left clear.										
   										
   										
   										
   										
   										
   										
   										
										
#**Weapon Description**										
										
   Varst’s weapon, Echtheid, is a nodachi with an orange blade and a solid black hilt and guard. The blade is detachable, and once it is removed Varst holds it in his left hand whle the hilt and circular guard will shift around his right hand. The hilt will transform into an arm brace and connects to the guard, keeping it parallel with Varst’s palm. From here, the weapon can fire lasers with or without the dust effects.	
								
   										
   										
   										
   										
   										
   										
   										
   										
										
#**Backstory**										
										
   Varst grew up in a mining colony on the northern edge of Sanus, right in between a frozen forest to the south and the cold sea to the north. His family was rather poor, with his parents working long shifts in the mines to compensate. Following those long shifts, the two went out to a bar to drink and enjoy themselves most days. As such, Varst was left at home alone most days. Living in this house was dangerous, however: it was constructed right on the edge of the forest, where Grimm lie in wait. As such, Varst’s father made it a rule that he was not allowed in the house during the day. He spent a lot of time with the locals and other children and became the embodiment of his home town as a result. Sadly, the townspeople were much like Varst’s family: poor and selfish. Everyone was focused on themselves first, attempting to carve out their own slice of the colony.	
									
   The colony’s owners were just as selfish, spending most of their wealth on security for the mine and personal luxury. One of the byproducts of the security program was a policing course in Varst’s school, which he signed up for so he could earn a little more money. The program involved schoolwork and an internship in which Varst shadowed a new officer every week. He enrolled in the course and learned the basics of fighting both people and Grimm. Varst had hoped to never use the latter part of his training, but that hope was shattered soon after his internship started. A Grimm attack in the south decimated his home, and the ensuing clean up and chaos forced him to work harder than he would ever have to. He had to keep all the victims from their collapsed homes during the cleanup; families who wanted their personal items, looters looking to make a quick buck, and squatters who needed a place to stay. It destroyed a part of his empathy, and gave him a desire to fight the beasts who caused the destruction.		
								
   Police training only covered evacuation and holding the line against Grimm, not hunting and killing of them. Varst decided to hunt the creatures in the forest instead. Knowing their strength, he purchased a nodachi from the local armory and began his hunting escapades in the afternoon. He knew that a big sword alone wouldn’t win any battles; he created a schedule to measure his progress and started small. One or two at a time, always careful to end the battle quickly so as not to alert a pack. His strength and acrobatic skill greatly increased during this time, and he quickly advanced to larger and more fearsome Grimm. As he moved up however, he became increasingly aware of how many Grimm he couldn’t fight; if there was any doubt he would lose, he wouldn’t take them on. It was the start of his black-or-white outlook on life.		
								
   He became more and more isolated as the days passed by. Though he had friends, he saw them far less. Though he had class, attendance was sparse. Though he had a family, they did not notice. Eventually Varst realized he couldn’t be happy within the walls of this broken and selfish colony. One day, he made the decision to leave his colony and find some place he could have a good life. Keenly aware of the dangers of the outside world but more excited for the possibility of a happy life, he left without a word to anyone.		
								
   He decided that the first key to happiness was some god damn warmth. He headed through the southern forests to find whatever the world had to throw at him. There were plenty of Grimm, which provided great fighting experience during his travels. After trudging through the forests and getting out of the snow, he found quite a few villages. The first few visits were the most fruitful; Varst did a few hunting jobs, experienced the culture, met the people, but decided to leave them so he could see more of what Remnant had to offer. He marked each village he visited on a map, with a quick note of each on the back. It became a travel journal of sorts; he’d look back on it at night to remind him of his journey and what is in the world. As he journeyed on though, he became less and less excited; he passed by many a ruined village, some that were paranoid of destruction, and even a few that were just….lifeless. It turned him into a very judgmental person: if a village seemed like a waste of time, he wouldn’t even bother with it. The few he did visit as a result of this rule were full of spirit: athletic competitions, artistic displays, the occasional theatre drama. All of these were exactly what Varst was looking for. Yet he had an unchecked love for the unknown, and he kept moving on. Until he got to the town of Huis.	
									
   Huis was your standard village: a few houses, a bar/inn, and a community of close friends and workers, all on a plateau overlooking the sea of trees below. Varst headed straight for the local bounty board, certain this place would be a wash but in need of food and money. While he was mulling over the various jobs, a mercenary commented on the young man’s age. The man introduced himself as Pyrus Lange, leader of a small mercenary group in town. Varst was immediately interested and ended up talking with him for a good hour. Pyrus invited him on a job to see how skilled Varst was, and the group set off. It was a simple job, just clearing Grimm from the local watering hole, but Varst was quickly outmatched. He cut down one or two creatures before watching in awe as the mercenaries fought in perfect harmony. There were 4 in total, each working in their own space and mindful of their partners at all times. Where they were, how well they were doing, what areas were left unchecked….it all went over Varst’s head. When the fight was over, Pyrus confronted Varst on his inaction; he meekly said he thought himself to be an obstruction to the group’s synchronization. Though he didn’t do much, the warriors still invited Varst to the victory celebration back at the local bar.	
									
   Varst sat in silence for most of the celebration, not so much in shame but more so in respect. He heard tales of victory, saw a few arm wrestling matches, and one or two people lose their dinner. At the end of the night, when everyone but Pyrus and Varst had left or passed out, the two had another chat. Pyrus wanted to know what drives the young warrior; why he fights, wanders, etc. Varst replied that he just wanted to find some place full of life where he could be happy. When he suggested Huis was that place, Pyrus denied that and instead recommended that Varst go to Beacon. A place full of young fighters with ideals and dreams about the world seemed a perfect fit for him! Right as Varst was about to respond, he heard fighting going on in the distance, and a villager came into the bar warning the two about a Grimm attack. The two grabbed their weapons and headed off for the battle.	
									
   They arrived on the south side of the village to find the rest of the mercenaries already fighting in separate areas. Pyrus and Varst followed suit, splitting up to cover more of the assault. The creatures came at Varst one or two at a time to start with, but their numbers increased as time went on. At one point a Griffon swooped in on Varst, catching him off guard and disarming him. The Beowolves were almost on top of him, and though he hadn’t ever used his aura for offense, Varst figured “fuck it” and rushed the creatures with a full fist assault. As he channeled his aura, a glowing white greatsword formed in his hands. Confused for a moment but more than willing to accept this new reality, he swung the sword at the advancing Grimm and cut the horde down to size. The sword dissipated right as the Griffon fell out of the sky, with Pyrus standing atop it. The two shared a laugh before Varst passed out in exhaustion; the sword strike had taken too much out of him.										
   										
										
#**Personality**										
										
   Varst has a very black or white outlook on life. To him, there is no difference between 99% and 0%; failure is failure and success is success. Knowing the “answer” to this question will often determine his choices, but when an unknown presents itself he becomes far more excitable. Though he’ll push for an outcome he wants, Varst is far too willing to accept a reality that he despises. He’ll often give up if he anticipates a bad outcome, going back to his whole “either/or” mindset.		
								
   He’ll usually begin conversations with an end goal in mind: learn something, talking to someone, or even just enjoying the conversation. However he only really cares about conversations with people he respects; while it isn’t particularly hard to earn that respect, it is easy to lose. Judgmental and impatient, Varst relies heavily on first impressions and it can be a bit hard for him to see past that. Especially bad is his treatment of faunus; due to his hometown culture, he sees them more as beggars only fit for menial tasks.	
									
   When confronted with a problem, he tends to bash it head on to see whether he’ll be able to solve it or not. If the problem isn’t a tangible issue, such as him being wrong or math problems, Varst tends to take a more silent approach to the problem. Thinking about what he knows, what he can do, how others could help him.										
   That tunnel vision has it’s benefits, though. He has tremendous focus, often spotting smaller details in the environment. Varst is also extremely excitable when it comes to hobbies and artistic things; finding out what people do to pass the time and enjoy themselves is one of his favorite things. Personally, he enjoys exploring his surroundings, going to nightclubs, or visiting museums.	
									
   Varst is a very “yes or no” kind of person who pushes for what he wants out of life. He can be easily discouraged and a bit difficult to work/talk with, due to a lack of empathy and a selfish mindset. He doesn’t care for the problems of other people, but will listen for hours and hours about someone’s passion. A very self-focused person who wants a life full of stories and joy.										
   										
   										
   										
   										
										
#**Notes**										
*Re-flavored Flaws*
							
Low Self Image - Varst knows (or thinks he knows) when he can't succeed or win. In situations like this, he suffers a -2 to rolls pertaining to the situation. The reason for this goes back to his whole either-or mindset; if he thinks he'll lose, there is little point in trying.		

Self Centered - Varst only cares for his own success, often abandoning others if they won't get him anything. Suffers a -2 penalty to all empathy related rolls due to his inability to relate to the struggles of others.					"

What platform will make me more valuable? Should I complete the Nanodegree before I even think about learning Swift 4 for iOS development? Do employers prefer someone who knows both platforms? If so should I wait on applying until I have both platforms under my belt? Are web development and database knowledge essential to understand what is being taught as far as mobile development?

Hey APP! So, by the title of this post, I'm guessing that you figured out that I want to play as a younger guy, we can discuss age in the description, that somehow ends up getting together for a secret sexual relationship with a celebrity.

I have a few ideas for this, and they all really depend on what sort of celebrity you play as (Singer, model, actress). However, they all generally include us spending a lot of time alone for whatever reason and this time allows us to build a good strong relationship without anyone else around.

1. I play as an intern at a recording/photography/movie studio that you are supposed to be working with.

2. I am your new assistant.

3. I am an interviewer who comes over to your house, and the interview begins to get pretty flirty and touchy before we end up fucking, making it a regular thing.

4. I am a new up and coming actor that won the chance to costar in a film with you and we decide to spend some time together and alone to get to know each other.

5. I am a lucky fan that got to spend a weekend with you at a resort.

6. I could be the son of a very important executive you are trying to get to sponsor your next project.

We can think of many more! Please message me with any celebs you are interested in playing! Also, [see my other prompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7odzp0/m4f_calling_all_submissives_who_want_to_be_made/) if you'd like more ideas of what we could play.

My kinks are: Raceplay (Especially Asian women), worship (you worship my dick), cuckolding, oral, anal, impregnation, BDSM (light), Bondage (light), clothing, bimbos"

I'm a computer science student in Norway who is about to graduate with a Master's, and I am very fortunate to have been offered a well paying software engineering job at a startup in San Francisco. 

I will be moving over in the very end of January, and one thing I am worried about is having trouble being able to rent an apartment because I don't have any U.S. credit history. I have excellent credit history in Norway, but as far as I understand, that does not mean squat in the U.S. unfortunately.

I did recently spend a year in the U.S. as an exchange student, during which time I also had an internship. This means that I have an SSN and an American bank account (Chase), but no U.S. issued credit card. Looking back I should have started building credit at that time, but I didn't think of that back then...

With that background information, does anyone have any suggestions for how I can either build credit quickly once I get there, or preferably start building credit in the coming months before I move? I have read that getting a secured credit card can be a good way to start, do you think it's possible to get one now, and start using it in Norway to build credit?

Thanks in advance!

97liqh,0,2018-08-15,"I'm so burnt out by dealing with creepy guys, and guys who've threatened my friends. I'm scared I'm gonna do something drastic",ImFedUp1,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/97liqh/im_so_burnt_out_by_dealing_with_creepy_guys_and/,"During college, I had a classmate stalk me, showing up where I'd study, eat, at my sports practices, randomly out on the street, etc. I never reported it because he never did anything blatantly illegal, but looking back I should have, I was very on edge all year. It only ended when I moved off campus.

At a past internship, I had another intern who would say creepy sexual stuff to me and the other female intern. Like joking ""I'm gonna r*pe"" you?"" ""What?"" ""Chill, I said I'm gonna GRAPE you"" or joking about breaking into my apartment. One time I went out with the whole intern group and he got blackout drunk and wouldn't keep his hands off me even though I threw him to the ground a few times. I ended up deciding I didn't want to stay in contact with him except for what was absolutely necessary for work. That led to him texting me a lot, showing up at my sports practice, and my desk at work, begging me to forgive him, saying he was too drunk to remember why I was mad. I just kept telling him to stay away and eventually he did. Thinking back, I should have not gone out with that group, since I already found that guy sketchy.

At another job, I had a mentor who came onto me at work, I briefly gave him a chance but quickly realized he was really pushy and I was uncomfortable with continuing seeing him as anything more than a coworker. He harassed me at work, trying to get me alone in meeting rooms and the parking lot, and asking me about my sex life and about our brief time dating even though I told him not to every time. I eventually went to HR with loads of texts sent to him saying stuff like ""I told you to not ask me questions about sex, or my personal life. Today you asked me (bla bla bla). That is exactly the kind of thing I am not comfortable with. Please just treat me professionally."" They took it very seriously, I had a huge paper trail of times he'd put his hands on me or asked invasive questions at work. I wish I went to HR sooner, but I was scared I'd be blamed equally for getting involved with the guy in the first place. I'd heard horror stories about things going badly with HR, from my family.

And that's just the stuff from my personal life. I worry about my friends a lot too.

One of my friends told me that years ago, a guy we both knew had choked her at a party, then played it off like flirting or a joke, and she didn't tell anyone. I'd always had a bad feeling about that guy, for small reasons, and I feel awful for not speaking up, or keeping a better eye on my friend.

I also recently found out that 4 of my girl friends were uncomfortable around a guy in our social circle who had been pushy towards all of them while drinking. I took it on myself to tell a couple people that the 5 of us would no longer be coming to events that person was at. That ended up working out for us, people stipped inviting him once they knew the situation.

One of my best friends just told me someone had sex with her when she was too drunk to consent, like basically incoherently drunk and not fully aware of what was going on. I tried to help by getting her a pregnancy test and info about std testing, but I still feel so helpless in general.

Whenever I'm out with my friends, and someone gets creepy with one of them, I'm usually the one who has to step in and tell them to back off. Because most of my friends are a little more worried about causing a scene. It's happened a lot.

And overall, I'm just fed up. I feel so drained. It's like I'm playing a fucking game of whack-a-mole, I deal with one person and another pops up very soon after. I don't want this to be the rest of my life, but I feel powerless to stop it.

I've noticed myself getting more and more unwilling to tolerate this kinda shit. At first, that was a good thing, standing up for myself and my friends more. But I'm scared someday I'm going to take it too far and get myself in trouble. I'm so angry with all these experiences building up. I have a lot of shame that I was too scared or powerless to stand up for myself or my friends soon enough, or effectively enough. And I'm scared that the next time something like that happens, I'm going to overreact and make a big mistake.

Not too long ago, I came very close to smashing a glass bottle over the head of one of these people. And I only held back at the last minute because I thought of the legal consequences. But the idea of hurting him, if the law wasn't a thing, didn't bother me, or scare me. And knowing that about myself does scare me. But I'm worried that with all this anger building up, especially anger at people who have hurt my friends, I'm going to do something drastic.

I told one of my friends about this, and he said he didn't see me as someone who would have it in them hurt another person, he said not to worry. But I just don't think he sees that, because I hide it.

My dad suggested I start learning martial arts, to teach me how to defend myself if I need to, but also teach me discipline and teach me the appropriate time to fight vs walk away. I think I'm going to do that.

I'm also seeing a therapist, I I'm going to bring this up to her.
But I'm still just feeling so burnt out, and exhausted, and helpless. And I don't know how to change that.

Has anyone experienced something similar? How did you deal with it?

How can I protect myself and my friends without always feeling so exhausted and burnt out and angry?

TLDR - I'm just so fed up with dealing with creeps, I've seen some bad stuff in my own life, and from friends. I don't know how to get past it mentally."

So I've been speaking to this guy for about a month now. We met while I was out in London for a friend's birthday (bottomless brunch so I was quite drunk aha). I wasn't looking for anything as I've just recently come out of a long term relationship and also just wanted to enjoy the night with my friends, however I got chatting to him and his friends and generally had a nice time. As I got up to leave he jumped up to ask for my number. He then text me that night and the next morning asking for a date (and I found out later he had told one of my friends he was going to ask me out) so all in all pretty keen. I tend to think I am a good judge of character and I certainly didn't get any 'player' vibes from him.

I was pretty hesitant at first due to the age gap (I assumed he was mid 20's when we met and he assumed the same), this was the biggest issue in my mind. Slightly smaller issue is that he is German and only in UK for a few months on an internship. However I've been out of the dating game for 2 years and thought 'Why not?' for something I knew could only ever be casual and therefore a good way to 'ease' my way back into dating.

We messaged pretty much every day leading up to the date, he was very lovey dovey from the get go (lots of heart emojis and kisses) but I put that down to his age. Finally the date happened and he was really sweet, a real gentleman - opened all the doors and paid for everything. He had just the right amount of awkwardness to make him endearing (and also confirm in my mind that this wasn't some seasoned player). We kissed at the end of the night and all in all it was a lovely evening. We both said we would like to see each other again and also said we were sad about the distance thing. I initiated the kiss and he asked me afterwards if he was good, again in my mind not coming across as an uber confident player.

We have been talking regularly since then and he's also sent me a few (unasked for!) topless selfies. Again I assumed this was due to his age/just how it happens in the dating world these days. We had spoken openly on the date about our issues with online dating and how we both much preferred to meet someone in real life and see if there was a 'click.' I spoke a bit about my past relationships but he didn't offer any information and I didn't think to ask at the time (not everyone is comfortable talking about it after all). All in all I got the impression of a genuine, sweet guy who was currently in the dating game and had been for some time (I discussed him paying for me and asked if it was something he did for every date and how did he feel about the girl paying etc; his answers definitely gave me the impression he had been on a few dates even while being in London).

Fast forward to now - all the time we had been talking on Whatsapp, he never had a profile pic, which I thought was slightly odd but actually took it as another encouraging sign that he wasn't a player (don't ask me why!). He updated it today and so of course I clicked on his profile to check it out. That's what I noticed for the first time that he had a status written in April '18 saying something along the lines of: 'The most amazing thing happens on 19th November &lt;3 I love you Lorena &lt;3'

Of course I tried not to jump to conclusions but it seemed very much to me like Lorena might be a girlfriend or at least an ex....while I was debating what to say (and also sending screenshots to friends asking their opinion haha) I decided to ask him why he finally updated his Whatsapp profile pic to see if that would lead to any clues. As he was replying I checked his profile again and this time all the heart emojis and the bit at the end about 'Lorena' had been removed.

I debated if I should ask him about Lorena or even just 19th November but was worried about how this would come across, and then I remembered he had told me his surname on our first date. I decided to do some stalking and a short time later found his Facebook page where his profile pic was him and a girl. His privacy settings were really high though so I couldn't see much more, but then I realised he was still 'in a relationship with...'Lorena'. So I got to her profile and sure enough her cover photo is them two together. But again not much activity on her wall so I was unsure if this is maybe a very new break up or what....(I know)

Finally having the amazing stalking skills I have, I found her Instagram page and finally his (he told me he didn't have one). His is private but hers isn't. She posts a lot and he has commented on pretty much every pic complimenting it and most recently saying stuff like 'I love this girl' and 'hottest girl in the world'. This was also happening the last month, the whole time he has been writing to me. If my stalking is correct then I think they have been together since 2012.

So - I'm pretty sure he has a girlfriend, not quite sure how I feel about it all, obviously annoyed at him for doing that to his girlfriend (who is gorgeous by the way!!!) but also annoyed at myself that I wasn't able to pick up on any of this until now and just generally feeling a bit sad that he would do this.

So what I guess I'm asking is:

\- is this as clear cut as I think it is? Does he have a girlfriend?

\- do I tell him I know?

\- Do I say something to her? If yes, how (assuming Facebook message...?) and what do I say??

Sorry for the long post, I wasn't sure how much detail to include!

**TL;DR** Recently found out that the guy I have been talking to has a girlfriend. He was the one who pursued me even though we both knew there was no long term future in it, and we subsequently had 1 date where we kissed and both said we liked each other. Should I tell his girlfriend?"

Problem is I occasionally work on files for work using my bosses Solid Works Seat that he has set up so that one of us can use at a time (I know he went through solid works to set this up so I am sure it is above board). I wanted to install the student license as well so I don't tie up his license when working on school stuff. Is there a way to have two licenses on one machine?

Additionally (although I don't think it will mater) I am running these on a virtual machine on my Mac using VMware fusion.

97n2ul,1,2018-08-15,I [M/24] am trying all I can to make a last effort to connect to my classmates in our last year. Is it still possible?,AdamNew1334,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/97n2ul/i_m24_am_trying_all_i_can_to_make_a_last_effort/,"Hi all, I am typing this with a very sleepy mindset, yet an important one. I have been socially anxious during most of my college. Now year 4 comes around (while I am re-doing half a year of year 3 after some personal life struggles). Now everyone is starting to move away for internships and such. A few months back I had the strength to accept that I have social anxiety and now am doing everything to make plans with friends from the class I started this collage with. I don't have a ""standart group of friends"", but I always tried to build bridges with several people in my class. Still, I didn't do a lot with them in the past years (declining invitations, going out with them, etc.). However, for the past 2 months I have tried to open up more about my situation to friends of collage and am trying to actually invite them over and try to actually connect more with all of them.  But summer vacation is almost over and some of my friends are soon going on their internships. I am willing to stay in touch with them via social media and such. 
They will probably be available now and then to come near the city where we all studied, but I do have some friends that are going to stay around a bit. 

What I ask is a strange question: Is it possible and worth the effort to build a better and close connection to my friends in order to become better friends? Or is am I wasting time and should I focus on the group of people who I will join in in this upcoming year?
And should I perhaps start over again with the mindset and try to party, go out and so on during the upcoming year in order to catch up with what I have missed in these past years, like a base friend group and such?

Again, I'm in a tired mood and depressed to a big extend, so there are all sorts of thoughts and questions going on, since it all seems so intimidating.



Tl;dr Socially anxious me is trying to connect more to friends I have made in these 3 years and now they all go on internships. Is it still possible to connect to many of them in this short amount of time?"

&amp;nbsp;

Helena Bertinelli pulled off her helmet and set it on her handlebar as she cut the engine to her bike. The neighborhood she'd pulled into was one of a nice middle income with manicured lawns and nice cars. The lifeblood of Gotham. She wrinkled her nose in disgust though at all the ""sameness."" These were the people who had everything in life except perspective.

She hopped off her bike and approached a light yellow house with an oak door. A couple raps and the door opened. A woman with light brown curls stood in the doorway with a look of surprise on her face. Inara's mother. The woman's watery eyes always looked on the verge of tears and she didn't even say anything before pulling Helena into a hug.

""Thank you so much for coming. You're such a good friend. Inara's so lucky to have you.""

Helena tried to peel the woman off of her with as much respect as she could muster. ""Is she back in her room?""

Inara's mom nodded enthusiastically and followed her gesturing as though she didn't know the way. Helena tried her hand at a smile for the woman, but she just couldn't muster it. The woman's emotions always seemed so exaggerated. Instead, she walked down the hall to a nondescript white door and opened it, foregoing the knock.

Unlike the rest of the house, Inara's room was covered in every inch of band posters. Ones that apparently all loved a black background and illegible fonts. Inara herself lay on a rather girly bed that stood in stark contrast to the black posters all around. She barely moved her eyes to see who it was before returning to the phone in her hand.

""Hey,"" she said, her voice still musky from their fight. Inara's nose still had a deep purple and yellow sheen to it that made Helena feel a touch guilty. Only a touch though. Inara had tried to kill her after all. She sat down on the bed near Inara's feet.

""You feeling any better?""

Inara rolled her eyes without putting her phone down. ""No. I'm clinically depressed. The world sucks. Et cetera, et cetera.""

Why couldn't she just answer the question without being a sarcastic bitch? Helena took a deep breath and ignored her response. ""How's the new psychologist?""

Inara put her phone down and propped herself up on her elbows. ""Have you been talking to my mom about me?""

Helena crossed her arms. ""Yeah, and?""

For a brief moment, Inara looked like she wanted to yell and scream, but then her fire just kind of died. She collapsed back on her bed and pulled her phone back up. ""I'm really tired, Hel. Could you go?""

Helena thought about forcing the issue, but from the phone calls with Inara's mom, she knew that her new medicine still needed time to help stabilize her. If it would. Why did medicine have to be such a guessing game? ""All right,"" Helena said, getting up. ""Hit me up if you need me. I'll be back soon.""

Inara didn't respond. So Helena stepped out of her room and was met by Inara's mother, watery eyed and wringing her hands anxiously. She knew Inara's mother cared, but damn, she felt for Inara sometimes. The woman seemed to be expecting something from Helena, but she just shook her head and another shock of guilt hit Helena at her mother's crestfallen face.

&amp;nbsp;

&lt;°&lt;°&lt;°|°&gt;°&gt;°&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

*Maybe try California? Vitamin D is supposed to be good for people,* Babs typed out.

*Maybe,* Kara texted back. 

Frustrated, Barbara put her phone down on the red mesh table. The two of them had talked intermittently since Kara had left, but any time Barbara tried to pry, Kara became elusive or vague. Frustrating. Every time. How could you help someone if they wouldn't talk to you about it? She sighed. Oh well, she'd try some more later.

Checking the time on her phone, Babs wheeled out from behind the table and tossed the wrapper of her Nice bar into a nearby trash can. She had her ""vocal lessons"" with Dinah soon and the music building had the worst elevator. And only one. As she arrived, the elevator took forever since other students who easily could have used the stairs were on it. She rubbed at her jeans, imagining the feeling of her bat suit. Of running again. If she had it with her, she could take the stairs too.

The door opened and a small herd of music students shuffled out, not even having the awareness to look guilty for making Barbara late. She rolled up to the door and knocked. The door swung inward and revealed a dark skinned girl who was both pretty and petite. She smiled at Barbara and Babs couldn't help but smile back.

""You're Karen Beecher, right? You date Dick's friend Mal?"" Barbara said.

Karen blushed, a subtle thing on her dark cheeks. ""Well, yes. We haven't really told anyone yet. I didn't realize it was that obvious."" *Oops.* Keeping the web of information she was supposed to know and information she'd found out separate could grow confusing at times. ""And you're Dick's... You know Dick, right?""

""...Yeah. Dick and I are... friends. Do you two hang out a lot?""

""Oh. No, not really. I talked to him a few times before Mal and I started dating. We haven't had the chance to hang out with the three of us yet. Dick's always so busy.""

""Yeah,"" Barbara said flatly. She didn't really like where this conversation had headed. ""Well, I guess-""

Dinah popped her head around the door. ""Barbara? You're late,"" she said with a harsh, yet teacher-like tone. The cover really did fit her. Dinah turned back to Karen sweetly. ""Thanks, Karen. You're doing great. Maybe I can convince you and Mal to sing a duet in the Master class next month?""

Karen laughed nervously. ""I'm not very good yet, Professor Lance...""

""Well, think about it. Nothing more romantic than a duet with your loved one,"" she said with a big wink. Karen blushed further, laughed it off, and hustled on her way. Barbara shook her head and wheeled past her into Dinah's office. It had a desk shoved into a corner, but most of the room was cleared away just in front of an upright piano.

""You shouldn't tease Karen. She seems really nice.""

""And after I took the effort to bail you out of an awkward conversation?"" Dinah asked, her eyes twinkling with mirth. ""Besides, I'm a music professor. If I wasn't eccentric, they'd assume something was wrong with me.""

""I'm not even sure eccentric is an act for you.""

Dinah shrugged. ""I mean, I do think Karen and Mal would have a lovely duet. Mal's voice is magnificent and Karen's got a nice timbre if a little pitchy on her high notes, but practice will work that out.""

Babs rolled her eyes. ""And you call me a geek. Actually,"" Babs started as she wheeled herself away from the door, ""I have something important that I want to talk to you about.""

Dinah leaned back against the piano and crossed her arms, her expression serious. ""What's going on?""

""So my Oracle persona has been gathering some attention."" Dinah gave her an odd look, but Babs just held out her phone to a screenshot of the message she'd received. Dinah took it and read aloud.

""Oracle, I've watched your work and must admit that I find myself intrigued. Perhaps you'd humor me with a game of sport in Gotham?"" Dinah looked up at her, no longer reading. ""That's bad, Babs. They know you're in Gotham. And what's with the characters at the bottom?""

""Those characters are Chinese for ""Savant."" And they're guessing that I'm in Gotham. I suspect using a similar method as you did. I'm a bit more widespread now, but if they were watching my early movements, it would explain that at least.""

Dinah tossed her phone back to her. ""How many others saw this message? I'm assuming you don't have an 'Oracle@' email address.""

Babs laughed. ""I do actually, but that's not where Savant sent it. He spread it out across various outbound packets from government leaders and the like. Encrypted. Between the people that are good enough to catch and decipher, they wouldn't need Savant to tell them about the Gotham lead.""

""You say that like it's not a big deal,"" Dinah said, disapprovingly. The way Dinah flirted between friend, employee, agent, and annoying big sister with her was... fun actually. It made all their conversations a clever dance or a maze that had to be navigated. It reminded her a bit of Dick. Well, that soured her thoughts again. Why couldn't she just accept Dick's feelings? No. She had her chance. He'd be happier with someone that could go on long walks with, leap across the rooftops-

""Barbara,"" Dinah said sharply, grabbing her attention. ""That just means Savant is good.""

Babs grinned. ""Well, sure... but I'm better. Besides, I have my secret weapon.""

Dinah raised an eyebrow. ""Secret weapon?""

""You."" Babs grin widened and Dinah rolled her eyes. She pushed off from the desk and playfully shoved Babs shoulder.

""Flatterer,"" she said, but she was smiling as she sat down at the piano. ""Now come on, let's work on those pipes.""

Babs mouth dropped open. ""We're *actually* going to sing?""

Dinah's eyes twinkled with a satisfied payback. ""What? You didn't think the music department would let you take a class without at least giving you an end of year test, did you?""

Barbara groaned.

&amp;nbsp;

&lt;°&lt;°&lt;°|°&gt;°&gt;°&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

Helena stalked the night. Claudio, the rat, had been happy to tell her about his competition, the other gangs and families that had felt bold enough to work in Gotham again. Her target tonight was a drug handoff for the Romano family.

In a quick motion, Helena hopped on the side of a dumpster before finishing her jump on top of an old hardware store that overlooked the warehouse where the deal was supposed to go down. Nearly two dozen cars were parked outside. Some shitty. Some really nice. That disparity of quality is pretty much the hallmark of ""I make my money selling drugs."" With a distro like this, Helena expected most of the people there to be young kids.

She pulled a small pair of binoculars that she'd brought, but she couldn't see much more from this angle. A few people were loitering outside, but they didn't look like family men. She'd have to get closer. She slipped down from the old hardware store, sneaking between the mass of cars outside the warehouse, and stealthily approached the group of people standing outside. She wrinkled her nose at the cigarette smoke wafting her way from them.

""Shit, guys,"" a girl in a simple hoodie said. ""I've got this one regular who buys this shit like candy. I think he's some intern at a big company and brings it to all their parties. It's like I get a hundred customers in one.""

The other people who sounded like guys all jostled her. ""Dammnnn, Glenda. Let us in on that.""

""G-unit, you're the tits!""

A pause and then the group burst out laughing. ""What the shit, Derek?"" Glenda said. ""Who even says that?""

Helena rolled her eyes as the dealers continued to jostle Derek and swap stories, but soon someone shouted from the warehouse and the little group stomped their cigarette butts into the concrete drive before hustling back towards the warehouse. Helena followed them at a distance, her own footsteps disguised by the dealers'. Unfortunately, they'd left a guard near the entrance with a shotgun so she wouldn't be able to take a look that way. In her favor, only the entrance was guarded though.

Helena slipped around the side of the warehouse, but the only windows she saw were narrow daylight slits above where she could reach. She continued along the side until she noticed a fuse box. That looked just high enough for her to stand on and see into the warehouse. She grinned. With a quick jump, she managed to get on top of the box without creating too much noise or breaking the box. She looked inside.

A few dozen kids stood in a semi-circle listening to a man talk. The man wore a cheap suit that fit like desperation. Only those who weren't in the inner circle, but wanted to be, would dress like that. Hundreds of small paper wrapped packages lined a foldout table that had been laid out between the metal pallet racks. The wanna-be gangster was not the person who caught her eye though.

A giant, muscular man with dark hair and glasses stood off to one side of the man. His long hair hung to his shoulders, but the with the stubble and angular features, he still possessed a rough look. This man wore a simple cutoff black shirt and functional dark green pants. Where the other guards watched the surroundings, this one watched the Romano family man. Who was he?

The speech ended and a few of the kids came forward to take their respective packages and Helena knew it was time for her to act. She dropped from the fuse box and grinned at her wicked idea before opening the fuse box and flipping all the switches. If there was one thing criminals in Gotham feared, it was the night.

As the lights went out inside, a few of the kids screamed shrilly and she could hear the mass of people struggling to get away. Helena rushed back towards the front, slipping inside against the wave of kids sprinting to their cars. Dull emergency lights snapped on inside the warehouse, giving Helena just enough light to see the two guards standing near the back of the fold-out table.

A sweep and swift strike to the side of the head took out the first one with barely a noise. The other guard still spun though and Helena whipped out her hand crossbow and sent a bolt into the man's shoulder. He screamed. The Romano family man spotted her now just as she delivered a flying knee to the injured guard. She turned towards the wanna-be gangster just as the giant man hurtled towards her. 

She drilled a front kick into the giant man and he stumbled, but his momentum sent Helena herself flying backwards. *Stupid,* she berated herself as she spun to her feet. *Attack the feet. Chop down the tree.* The things Bruce had taught her spiraled into her head as the man closed into range. He was good. *Really* good. Even for a man so big, his attacks were lightning quick and it was everything that Helena could do just to dodge them. She darted in and out of his range, managing to land a few kicks against his longer reach, but the giant man seemed made of steel.

""Who is she?"" The Romano gangster squealed. ""You promised us protection.""

The giant man ignored the Romano with barely a grunt. *Deference,* Helena thought. *Now I'm really curious as to who he is.* Her glance towards the Romano man opened her guard in an instant. In that second, the giant attacked. A deadly hook flew towards Helena's head and by instinct, she brought her arm up to block. That was a mistake. Even with the block, the blow sent her flying off of her feet and rolling along the smooth concrete floor of the warehouse.

""Kill her! Kill her!"" the Romano man squealed, but the giant instead cocked his head as though listening. Despite the blood pumping in her ears, Helena pushed herself up, listening too. Sirens. Someone had called the cops. 

""We need to leave,"" the giant said. He spoke smooth and simple English, but there was just the hint of an accent. Russian? Was he a Russian gangster maybe? If the Russians were getting involved in organized crime, she was going to kill Claudio for not mentioning it. Without another look at her, the giant man left followed by the Romano family man who grabbed a handful of the packages under one arm.

Helena rose to her feet, head swimming. That Russian hit like a truck. She was pissed or concussed. Or both. At least the majority of the drugs were still on the table. She'd stopped them from getting it out. The two guards she'd taken out were both breathing and she'd kill to interrogate them to find out more about the Romano family, but the sirens continued to draw closer. In today's Gotham, that was as bad for her as for them. So she ran.

&amp;nbsp;

&lt;°&lt;°&lt;°|°&gt;°&gt;°&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

Barbara sat diagonally from Dinah at Mirko Pasta. The two of them came here fairly often and this table allowed both of them to see the doors as well as had a convenient place for her wheelchair. The pasta was made from scratch and the red sauces were all made with San Marzano tomatoes that had stewed for hours. That was true Italian pasta. At least, that's what Dinah had said. And the owner. And the server. And the cook. Still, it *was* good.

The server, a nice girl with dyed purple hair, filled up their glasses from the bottle of water in the center of the table as the two of them picked at their pasta.

""So I'm concerned about Huntress,"" Barbara said. Dinah's eyes turned to subtly watch the few patrons before responding.

""Yeah, she seems like someone with lots of problems. What in particular concerns you?""

Barbara set her fork down. ""So I stuck a tracker on her bike after we ran into her rescuing Alysia."" Dinah's eyebrow raised at that, but Babs kept going. ""Last night, she attacked one of the new crime families by herself. I called the police for backup and she got out, but still...""

""So you're worried that she's going to get hurt then?"" Dinah twirled her pasta into a small ball and folded a piece of bread around it. Babs had to wonder why she cared what quality the pasta was if she was just going to make a sandwich out of it, but she ignored it.

""No, one of the henchman for the family was picked up by the police and had a crossbow bolt in his shoulder. Even with a bolt, dying of blood loss is a very real possibility.""

""Ah,"" Dinah said after swallowing bite of her pasta sandwich. ""So it's a 'Red Hood' thing.""

Babs crossed her arms and glared. ""It's a 'she-doesn't-have-a-strong-enough-moral-compass-to-play-hero' thing. She could have killed that man.""

""And do we have a strong enough moral compass to play hero? Invasion of privacy? Blackmail?""

""But *my* way no one gets hurt.""

The two of them stared at each other as the purple haired girl came back to swap out their bread basket for a fresh one. They were supposed to charge, but Babs suspected the owner had a crush on Dinah. Not that the man had been untoward. The server gave them a smile and then retreated back towards the bar.

Dinah shrugged. ""Fine. So what's your plan with Huntress?""

Babs smiled. She didn't often feel like she 'won' with Dinah so she liked to savor the moment. ""Well, I've been thinking you could use a partner and she could use someone to look out for her.""

Dinah considered her for a moment and then shook her head. ""You're unbelievable.""

""Oh?"" Babs asked, her smile broadening. Dinah saw deeper than most people and Babs loved that about her.

""You've got a plan to lure out Savant, but you need an extra person. That's why you're bringing her in.""

Babs shrugged. ""One stone, lots of birds. I don't see an issue here.""

Dinah gave an incredulous smile and just shook her head. ""That's just because you can't see your own smug face."" The two of them laughed and returned their conversation to less serious means. She'd missed being able to just talk to someone. She and Kara had been close, but one of them had always seemed broken; Alysia couldn't know her true life; and Dick and Jason... Well, those were complicated at best.

Still despite her past relationships and the limited use of Batgirl, she felt at the top of her game. She had a loving family, a good friend, and important work. Oracle saw everything. Oracle knew everything. No simple hacker could stop her.

[Birds of Prey #3| Next&gt;] - Coming September 15th!"
97ni27,45,2018-08-15,My surgery yesterday,babbitybumble,Reduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/Reduction/comments/97ni27/my_surgery_yesterday/,"I spent the day before surgery doing some gardening, last-minute shopping and cooking--made some pesto we have yet to eat, etc. They called to tell me I should be at the surgery center at 6:30. I took the Hibiclens shower and per their instructions put on clean PJs and slept on clean sheets. I have been listening to a ""successful surgery"" guided meditation daily for weeks, so I did that one more time as I fell asleep. I was wide awake at 2:00, because my partner has been working nights so he falls asleep early and I do too! I took my daily meds then with one sip of water, and at 4:30 I took my second Hibiclens shower. Ugh. It made me feel gummy. We showed up for surgery right on time.

They left me alone to wipe myself off with more disinfectant and put on a gown. A nurse reviewed all my meds, allergies etc. and gave me some Tylenol. While we chatted, she started an IV--not my favorite thing but I am over 50 and have had an IV many times so it was no big deal. She offered me a caffeine pill to avoid headache because I'm a coffee drinker, but I turned that down--didn't feel like I needed it. My partner had gone to get much-needed coffee and something to eat, but he came back in and joined me until it was time for the OR. The anesthesiologist and his (intern? student?) came in to talk to me about nausea, because I had some med sensitivity that he said meant I shouldn't use a scopolamine patch. News to me! He clearly knew his stuff and gave me something different for nausea. Then the surgeon came in, shook my hand and my partner's, and we talked a bit about volume--I told him I wanted to go as small as possible and he said yes, but ""proportional,"" which did not worry much as I am only 5'4"" and pretty petite. He peeled the front of my paper gown down and drew on me while I reminded him not to put the nipples so high they pop out of a scoop neck (he laughed), then fastened it up again. I guess it wasn't too long after that they came to take me to the OR, but I was bored and impatient so it seemed like forever. Note: I was not anxious/nervous...I think the guided meditation really helped. Also, my surgeon was not warm/sweet but I was cool with his breezy manner--he's very cheerful and that suited me fine.

In the OR, I climbed up onto the table and they added some meds to my IV. They slipped on a blood pressure cuff and as they started securing that arm to the board, I fell asleep. 

When I woke up, my SO was in the recovery room and I was drinking the iced tea I brought. Apparently I finished all my crackers and also the surgeon came in and looked me over but I have no memory of that at all! I've had a colonoscopy before and it's the same, I don't remember anything from when I first wake up. I do remember the nurse fetching me more crackers because my blood pressure was so low and I thought some salty food might help. Eventually I got stable enough to sit all the way up and take an oxycodone, and then she walked me to the bathroom.

It is really hard to pee after anesthesia, but at least I didn't have a paralyzed bladder as I did once with a previous surgery. I just had to concentrate really hard. That issue lasted about 24 hours.

They wheeled me out, at my request, and I got into the car VERY CAREFULLY, put my pillow on and buckled up. I live about 15 easy minutes from the surgery center, and no speed bumps between there and here. Back at home I walked upstairs slowly because I was still woozy and a little queasy. I got in bed with my wedge pillow and tried to sleep for a while. When I woke up, my partner got me even more crackers...I just couldn't stomach regular food, I had no appetite and mostly just wanted water, but I did make myself eat some cheese, fruit and a cookie. I took Tylenol later and didn't need another oxycodone until about midnight when I woke up my partner to give it to me. I dozed off and on all night--my apartment has no air conditioning, so I was kind of warm, and the incisions were prickly, plus I was drinking a ton of water and I kept getting up to pee. I lost three pounds of fluid overnight.

This morning I made myself eat more and drink coffee, though I'm still not very hungry. I am super bored just sitting around the house; we read most of the day and watched a movie while I iced off and on, but I'm having some slightly blurry vision, probably because of the anesthesia. I had no appetite so we took a slow walk around the block before dinner; my body felt great out there but my incisions, OMG OW OW OW so I came in and put ice on immediately. So far I haven't needed the anti-nausea meds. I have terrible IBS so I didn't buy stool softeners, but if I need them, my partner can go fetch them. Also, my surgeon doesn't use drains, so I'm just uncomfortable from the swelling and the incisions. I get to take a shower tomorrow and I'm so excited to get the last of the betadine off me.

I finally thought to ask my partner this afternoon whether HE remembered the surgeon coming in afterwards, and he did! He had seen me when they unzipped the surgical bra. He said they removed about half my volume and he thinks I'll be really pleased when the swelling goes down."
97nzr1,1,2018-08-15,[F4F] Exhibit C,Jilling_Time,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/97nzr1/f4f_exhibit_c/,"""Hello everyone! My name is Natalie, and I'll be your tour guide this evening."" Oh great, *Natalie* was here tonight. Not that she was bad or anything, quite the opposite. She just knew so much about the exhibits that the guests would be spending far more time than usual at each one. ""If you look over to your right, you'll see our first exhibit here, the disobedient maid."" There were a lot of *oohs* and *aahs* from the crowd, as well as the sound of pictures being taken. I couldn't see from my current position, but I knew it by heart. It was a woman wearing a sexy french maid outfit entirely made of latex, with her hands bound behind her back and a feather duster sticking out of her mouth. ""As you can see here,"" Natalie went on, ""Alice here has been very naughty lately."" It was bullshit. It was just the shift she'd been asked to work. And honestly, she wasn't even the one that drew the short straw. ""Alice is stuck in this enclosure until she dusts off every single item in that room."" Typically there was a full bookshelf, a table with some ornaments, and a leather chair. A couple of times per evening the maid would ""accidentally"" knock over a chalice or decoration from the table, though sometimes it was deliberate. The crowd loved it anyway, looking on from the other side of the giant glass window.

Sure enough, Natalie spent ages answering stupid questions from the guests. Honestly, I just wanted them to move on. Eventually she did, although the next part was just as bad. ""Moving on, exhibit B here is known as the playpen."" I still couldn't see them, but I could hear the squeak of rubber and their (partially) exaggerated pants. There would be two girls in there, trussed up in latex bitchsuits that kept them down on all fours. I wasn't sure who it was tonight, but I knew they were both wearing ring gags that kept their tongues hanging out. Once again, the crowd cheered and took plenty of pictures. I knew the only exposed bits were their pussies and their tits, so their mouths would be busy tonight. The biggest variable was whether or not they were blindfolded or if someone had been given a strapon. Once again, Natalie took her sweet time speaking with all of the guests.

""Finally, we have the last exhibit in our tour tonight. And this one's a rather special one."" I gulped. I had been waiting for this for a while now, but I was still nervous. Not that there was much I could do anyway. ""Exhibit C, also called the decoration, is a personal favourite of mine."" That part was actually true. While Natalie spent plenty of time at all the Exhibits, this was one where she always got personal. ""Yes, there is actually a woman inside underneath all that."" I couldn't see the crowd, but I could feel them staring up at the wall. I was fully encased in a vacuum sealed latex prison, unable to move a muscle. My outline could be clearly seen by anyone. Despite the fact that my face was fully covered, I had a ball gag and blindfold underneath my bondage. ""As you can see here, this is one of our interactive exhibits."" Natalie pressed a button, and the dildo in my cunt started slowly vibrating. I screamed into my gag and writhed in place, much to the amusement of the crowd. My buttplug stayed still, so she must be saving that one for later. ""Don't worry,"" she told the crowd, ""you'll all get a chance to use the remote. Also, unlike the last ones, this is a hands on exhibit. You're welcome to get up there and feel any part you like."" I let out a groan at this point, both from pleasure and annoyance. It was going to be a long night.

I never should've taken an internship at the fetish festival.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hi everyone, thanks for reading through that massive wall of text. As you can tell, I'm looking to be a toy for others to play with tonight. If you want I can be in one of the other exhibits, or if you have any new ideas, please let me know! You're welcome to be the tour guide, the people in the crowd, or the manager coming down to see how things are. Who knows, maybe you can be another attraction that gets to interact with the other exhibits?

If your a fan of latex, hard bondage, public, and orgasm control, send me a message. My limits are incest, scat, beast, and underage. Pretty much everything else is on the table. I look forward to getting some orange envelopes."
97o18r,61,2018-08-15,"I (21F) don't want to be friends with a good friend of a mine (F22) anymore, but the problem is we are in the same sorority. Any advice on how to proceed and whether I'm being too rash?",AdvancedEmphasis,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/97o18r/i_21f_dont_want_to_be_friends_with_a_good_friend/,"Hi, everyone. I wanted to ask for advice on a situation I have with a friend. I am currently extremely upset with her and don't want to continue being friends with her, but as the title says we are in the same sorority and have many mutual friends. I know the title may cause some people to roll their eyes, but any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Anyways, to give some background information I've been friends with ""Juliet"" ever since the beginning of January when we pledged the same sorority. At the time, our connection was immediate-- we were both transfer students, older girls, from the same state and had similar personalities. We also were able to have deep conversations from the start, and we truly bonded over time, becoming each other's closest friend in the sorority. When I first met her, she was really sweet, down-to-earth, independent and mature. However, as time went on and we became more comfortable with each other, I started to see hints of a completely opposite side to her, which has come into full force in the recent few months. I no longer feel comfortable with her in the same way as before, and it's really disappointing to me.

One of the major roadblocks in my change in impression of her when she asked me a couple months ago to help her move all her heavy furniture into her new apartment. During that time, I was recovering from strep throat, had an assignment due that night, just moved down to my new place and didn't even buy my own furniture and just started a full-time internship. Needless to say, I was busy and sick (she knew about this), but I still helped her since she waited until the last minute and had no one else to do so. Throughout the whole ordeal, she was demanding, impatient and rude to me. If I didn't move the furniture quickly enough, she got upset. When I had to leave for an hour to fix my flat tire, she told me to hurry up. By the end of the entire 8 hours of helping her, I was so turned off by her behavior that my whole perspective on her changed. I felt unappreciated the whole time and she didn't really say thank you. In addition, she asked me if she could store nearly half of her furniture in my house, which I also said yes to since she waited until the last minute. I stored it for a whole entire month...

She needed a place to stay for two weeks and wanted to stay in my room with her cat (even though one of my housemates is allergic to cats). She got upset because one of my other housemates told her she's welcome to stay as long as she pitches in for gas, water and electricity. She gets extremely upset because we're all in the same sorority and expected to crash for free, and now she says she doesn't like the girl who asked her to pitch in. 

ANYWAYS, she ends up moving all her stuff out of my house except for a huge queen size mattress which took up a lot of space in my room. The girl I'm sharing a room with moved in a few days ago and the space was cramped and I was ready to get rid of the item. Because I own a small car, the only car that could fit the furniture was one of other my roommate's huge SUV. Juliet was currently visiting her hometown at another state until the end of this week, and I decided to drop the mattress off at her house so that I can finally free up some space in my room and save her and my roommate (whose car I borrowed) time and hassle to pick up her mattress from my house. I arrange with her roommate (whom I'm also friends with) to drop off the furniture. 

Juliet gets upset with me for doing this, telling me that I was ""rude"" and ""weird"" to not inform her beforehand that I was dropping off her mattress because she ""doesn't even know where it's going to go yet."" She never thanked me for storing her stuff or dropping off her mattress, even though it was heavy to carry and a hassle for me to get my housemate to borrow her car. I felt as if this was a huge turnoff, and that she was being really entitled.

I feel so turned off that I no longer want to be close friends with her, because ever since a couple months ago she's been acting entitled and rude. Even when I explained my perspective, she was adamant in her view that my actions were unwarranted and that I ""barged into her space"" by dropping off her mattress.

I really want space and distance from her, but the problem is, we are in the same sorority and have mutual friends and were our closest friends in the sorority. How do I handle this? Any advice or feedback would be appreciated. I'm sorry this is long and if I rambled-- I am currently venting right now.

TL;DR: I (F21) no longer want to be friends with this girl in my sorority (F22) due to a moving situation that was the last straw for me-- should I stay friends with her and/or any advice on how to handle this situation?"

Then it continued until in 2017, I finally developed anxiety. The sensation felt like something ""blocked"" my ability to have fun and enjoy things like I used to, I even went to Google to check if I had depression and I thought I had it. Then it went better in 2018, and I finally realised I had anxiety, I was silent for a couple of months about this back when I first made a Reddit account, then I remembered about the existence of this sub in July-August, and thougth, ""This sub is gonna be perfect for me to describe my issues! I can´t keep suffering alone anymore! I might relate to other sufferes like me, and may find help there!"" And then, I finally made my first post in this subreddit describing my issues. I really love this sub, but sometimes it triggers me, so I stop reading the posts half-way trought. The purpose of this adressing is that I had one of these episodes today, as I write this, it is getting better and probably be better when I wake up (I hope) but I can´t be excited anymore. All the things that I feel now is... despair. Despair and internal panic that I am gonna constantly feel like this like the first 2 years with my anxiety. Fear and intern panic. That´s what I feel.

Anyway, I will have to read a short passage from *Looking for Alaska* and most likely will also need to say something about what it means to me.

How do you like to interpret the events in the book and the actions of the characters? Feel free to leave any thoughts or your favorite quotes (page numbers or chapter numbers would be helpful too so I can narrow down what to read).

I'm a rising senior in MA, and was wondering how I stack up to some recent freshmen at their time of applying, and wondering how to improve my chances. I have a GPA of 3.46-3.66(rough conversion from 5.0), and an SAT of 1380 (690 on math and english). I was also questioning whether or not to do an interview with the admissions office.

I am particularily worried about my GPA, as it is on the lower end of the accepted students range. However, I have some extracurriculars that I feel would help me get accepted, but I don't know how to incorporate them into my application. I had an internship at a major company as a software engineering intern, and I feel like that would be a great thing to improve my chances, but I don't know where to talk about that.

I also do Cross Country, and indoor/outdoor track as varsity, but I  don't want to do that in college, so I don't think that would be beneficial to talk about at all.

Finally, I used the [net price calculator](https://www.wpi.edu/admissions/tuition-aid/financial-need/net-price-calculator) and it said with my situation i would be paying about $38k, but I don't think thats accurate, as my family says I won't get much in terms of financial support due to the household income. Did other students find this calculator accurate, or is it a very rough guess?

I will be hosting a family friend’s kid who is coming to Sac for an internship. He is (I think 20) so no bars, wine tasting etc. I am only hosting him for the weekend before he moves into his housing for the summer, so Friday to Sunday AM. 

My question (if it isn’t  obvious) is what are some non booze activities in Sac? I am thinking dinner at Burgers and Brews new roof top the night he gets in, then maybe the desert diner after. Next day a run on the river or bike ride and then I am done. Usually I’d do wine tasting on the delta, dinner and drinks in midtown and then boozy brunch on Sunday or dim sum, but now I have no clue. 

Seems like everything non boozy is too old (Crocker) or too young (Zoo and fairytale town).

I really like the show. I even like and care about most of the characters. But some of the plots just seemed kinda random or uninspired:

-Dr. Bailey trying to switch to Pedes just to change her mind at the last second
-Callie switching teams
-Dr. Hahn becoming a regular to just suddenly disappear
-Izzy and Denny
-Izzy and Alex
-George becoming a side character
-Lexie and Meredith's development coming to a complete halt for dating Mark. 
-Meredith's crazy friend (when she cut herself for the interns to practice)
-More unrealistic operations
-and the big one, George's death. 

I can go on but this list is long enough already. I don't think these plot ideas are necessarily bad, but they were either poorly executed or had very little payoff (Dr. Bailey and Denny storylines). However my biggest gripe is how they handled George. Maybe controversial around here but I liked George, as well as the other main residents. He was always an important character. In the beginning of the season it seems like they were setting him up for becoming a Resident, and a possible romance with Lexie. Both those things get tossed out the window after the first few episodes and then he never really shows up again. Callie becomes a bigger character than him at this point. He gets no story or development and right at the end he just gets killed off without warning. Did the actor do something to piss people off? Also the writing and characters just didn't seem as tight as seasons 1-3. I liked 4 but it was a slight step down (definitely sucked losing Burke and Addison). 

What do you guys think? Please no spoilers beyond the season 5 finale."
97pq5l,313,2018-08-16,Traveled solo for over a month and it’s really changed my life,BrazenSerpent56,solotravel,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/97pq5l/traveled_solo_for_over_a_month_and_its_really/,"So all my life I’ve been a natural introvert, so it was only a mater of time before I did a real solo trip. 85% of my life is spent doing mostly solo activities, with a bit of time left for my best friend. A few years ago, I was really depressed and down about my life. I was living with family (who can be quite demanding) and busting my ass in grad school. It all became too much this last semester so I decided so get as far away from my home as possible for at least a month. 

I was accepted into a study abroad program in Israel back in May that would last 3 weeks long. After that, I was also accepted to a funded residency program in Jerusalem for another month. I decided that I would take an additional trip to Athens as well, since it was pretty close and the tickets were inexpensive. 

My 3-week long study aboard program was actually the most taxing, because I spent a lot of my time around other people (which for me is a lot). The internship was a blessing, not only because I got to work overseas and earn money, but also because I had my own dorm room and had a lot of time for self reflection. 

After the internship, I spent a day in Tel Aviv at a hostel where I met a few interesting people by chance and we all had drinks. Currently, I’m in Athens at my hotel where it has been a true blast! I’ve gotten to see all the sights I wanted and eaten the best seafood. I have to go back to Tel Aviv to catch my flight back to the US so I get to see more stuff there. 

I think what’s scary about traveling solo is just trying to survive on your own and dealing with your own brain (thoughts, emotions, fears, etc.). So many times, our society pushes this idea that being alone is somehow bad or undesirable. When in actuality, it’s the time you grow as a person and figure out what you really want. Back home I’m always bombarded with task, opinions, and concerns from family, friends, teachers, etc. But here I am only responsible for myself. 

And this is not all to say that there weren’t times I didn’t feel lonely or depressed. I just didn’t internalize those feeling to the point were it out weighed my gratitude for my chance to really travel. We all have an amazing opportunity to see things most people would kill for, and I’ll take loneliness as a result of that any day. 

I have a better grasp of what I want to change about my life back home to make it better for ME. Not my family, not my friends, not my teachers, me. I’m very excited now. Some people will be angry with the choices I’ve made while I’ve been here, but such is life. I’m tired of not living for myself and this trip taught me that. 

Looking at this sub before the trip really gave me hope that solo travel was definitely a worthwhile thing, and for that I thank you all.

97q45g,13,2018-08-16,I'm a pharmacy student...saw a customer make a scene at the pharmacy as I was picking up my medication and it kind of made me feel conflicted,Cute_little_doge,pharmacy,https://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/97q45g/im_a_pharmacy_studentsaw_a_customer_make_a_scene/,"So right by my pharmacy school, there is a retail pharmacy that I pick my own prescriptions up from, and tbh even I get annoyed by the lack of communication by the staff there.  Literally, this is the school pharmacy that all the students go to...you would think they understand how the school insurance works.....yet they had no idea how to process my school insurance and I had to go back three or four days in a row because they said they needed to call my insurance to figure out how to get it to work and then literally never even bothered to do that three days in a row. When I was a tech my pharmacy manager would NEVER let that kind of stuff fly so idk what the deal is with this one.

But still, even when I got annoyed with them, I tried to cut the staff some slack because it was nbd for me to stop by since i'm always on campus, plus a lot of the staff there are students on rotations who clearly are overwhelmed and trying to learn multiple systems and I get it - especially if you have never worked in a pharmacy before. By the third day the tech told me it wasn't ready and to come back the next day so they can call the insurance I was like ""hey just so you know, this is the third day in a row i've come back  to try and pick up my prescription and each day a different staff member told me they would call the insurance but nothing ever happens. I understand you guys are busy, and I understand it was not you who I spoke to but I need this to be sorted out today once and for all because to be honest, I feel like i've been very patient offering to come back day after day, but i'm constantly being given the run around by the staff here and that's not very respectful of my time plus i'm almost out now so I can't wait. I'm hoping you can be the one to help me."" I said this very softly so only the tech could hear and I tried to keep my tone very calm. I ended up having to call the insurance myself and walking the tech through it because they just seemed lost.

Literally as this is going on, the guy next to me who was waiting for his prescription for 10 minutes gets called up to the counter and the pharmacy intern tells them that they checked but they do not have his prescription in stock so they have to order it and offered no solution....didn't even ask him to come back. This guy gets PISSED off. He wasn't yelling, but he was talking very loud and condescendingly and making a scene and saying something along the lines of ""Are you kidding me!??? You made me wait 10 MINUTES. This is absolutely ridiculous. Let me speak to the pharmacy manager"". He then turns to me and says ""can you believe this? This is absurd."" and was kind of expecting me to agree with him but I just looked at him and smiled because while I get why he would be annoyed, he was also being a douchebag for making SUCH a scene and expecting a random stranger to agree with him. After I said nothing, he turns to his wife and complains across the room loudly. Pharmacy manager comes and tells him that they have the generic in stock and they could give him that one if he is willing to let them call the doctor. This makes the guy even more mad, he was like ""ok so you said you don't have it now you do. So if I didn't ever ask to speak to the manager  you guys would have just sent me off without it. You could have just asked me in the first place if I wanted generic it would of been ok. You know what, no, give me my prescription i'll have someone else fill it"". and literally all the manager has to say to that was ""it wasn't me who said that"".

Idk this whole situation made me feel so conflicted. I feel like as a pharmacy student I am empathetic because its hard to remember to do things when you have so much on your plate and its frustrating to be humiliated by a patient when the issue wasn't even your fault. On the other hand, this pharmacy is terrible at communicating and as a patient its understandable for things to slip once but once I came back the second day they should have prioritized my issue. When I worked as a tech, the manager would have apologized and explained the situation and would have solved the patient's problem asap. Do you guys ever feel conflicted when you are at a pharmacy as a patient and encounter situations like these?"

97q932,13,2018-08-16,Made a throwaway account because I am ready to talk and no one is listening.,FairyDogmas,rape,https://www.reddit.com/r/rape/comments/97q932/made_a_throwaway_account_because_i_am_ready_to/,"I lost my virginity at 14 towards the end of eighth grade to 21/22 year old man. He was “in love with me” although he said he would leave me if I didn’t sleep him. He was forceful. He would tell me no one would love me that much. That I wasn’t pretty enough to wait for. If I tried to leave he’d emotionally manipulate and threaten to kill himself. He would talk to other girls online my age who he said actually put out. I did and he still went with these other young girls. I hated them. 

Eventually through a stroke of miracle I left. But I didn’t think I was raped. I thought he was just some crazy ex boyfriend. 

In high school, a young male teacher would flirt with me through text. At 16, I thought it was romantic. At 23, I think it’s vile. 

When I was 18, I was offered a ride by a coworker from the bar we all had a drink at to the lot I had parked in. He passed the lot and locked the doors. When he did, he put my hand down his pants and made my touch him. He was kissing my neck. All while driving. I could’ve died. A part of me wanted him to crash.

I told a friend about this and she said she experienced the same thing. We decided to go tell our three male bosses about this. We were subsequently fired but not before hearing a chorus of “but what were you wearing?”

I am now the oldest I’ve ever been, with the most clarity I’ve ever had. I never knew that I was still being choked by this. I now know that a 22 year old man has no business with a middle schooler. I know now that every subsequent meaningless sexual encounter I had throughout high school was about my validation. Every meaningful relationship I’ve ever had has been a safety blanket. My issues in high school with drug abuse wasn’t just reckless teen partying, but me trying to cope with my trauma.

To this day, no matter how much I advance in my career, am constantly seeing the trauma of this rear it’s ugly nasty head. The other day I was already drunk with some coworkers after getting rejected for an art fellowship, was asked how I felt about an intern who was a transphobic rape apologist. I said how I felt about him as kindly as I could. Still, there were comments thrown around about how he has the right to express his opinion. Even if that opinion is that the guy should always be believed if there is no hard evidence. There is no hard evidence in my case. Do I not count because I was too young and afraid? I spent the rest of the night mumbling about these men who’ve hurt me or validated me in some way.  I don’t want to be this way anymore. I don’t want to be a victim anymore. I don’t want to need validation. 

I want to end my four year long relationship and go on a journey of self discovery. This is a very serious decision for me, because I still love this person very deeply. However he has a nasty temper. He has not hit me, but he has done things to make me feel that if I stay, I have no self respect. I don’t want to be that person anymore.

Does anyone here ever wonder what they would be like if there trauma didn’t happen to them? Would I be a strong, independent ass kicking artist? I  wouldn’t have my anxiety and my need for validation. But then would I even have turned to art if I wasn’t searching for an escape? Would I be interested in the strife of the third world the way I am now (which much of my art is built on), if I didn’t look into trying to show myself reasons to live which is to deliver my message?

I know this is long and no one will read it haha. It just felt so good to write all this. I want to stop seeking validation. "
97r84d,2,2018-08-16,I don't know what to do,Nevermore10,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/97r84d/i_dont_know_what_to_do/,"I'm 22, I'm a programmer ( intern pentester ) and I think I'm going into a depression. I have a problem since I was born, my right hand is shanking uncontrollable, basically I cannot hold a glass of water without spilling it if I don't use both hands and I think that's the main reason girls are rejecting me. My left hand is also shaking but not so hard.
2 weeks ago I drank some coffee with a girl at work but she seems a bit scared with my problem and that happened with almost all girls I talked with. Now I think she is dating someone else and I have no more motivation talking with girls.

I've got only rejections and now before I talk with a girl I will always think that she will have a problem with my problem.

I really don't know what to do with this cuz I cannot change the fact that my hand is shaking. I've tried going to the gym ,talking with my dad about that but he told me that television will come if I will get a girlfriend so fuck him.

I've also tried to read some books  (e.g. the art of seduction by Robert green ) but then I thought that it will not change anything.

What can I do guys ?"

97sgtt,7,2018-08-16,"Jonathan Hunter Theorizes RE: USL, Utah, and Sean",n0ia,ChattanoogaFC,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChattanoogaFC/comments/97sgtt/jonathan_hunter_theorizes_re_usl_utah_and_sean/,"Thread starts here: https://twitter.com/Chattwjonathan/status/1030059140201230336

&gt; The U.S. has a history of people who are big supporters of their community on one hand, and ruthless businessmen on the other: Andrew Carnagie comes to my mind.
&gt; 
&gt; Is Bob Martino, a commercial real estate developer from Utah in the same mold? From what I hear, probably not.
&gt; 
&gt; Was Sean McDaniel, former General Manager, part-owner and co-founder of Chattanooga FC, cold calling Utah businessmen in order to debase his friends' club and turn around with the glorious title of (wait for it...) General Manager for CPS?
&gt; 
&gt; I know Sean.  This is not remotely true
&gt; 
&gt; Did Bob Martino have in-depth knowledge of the emerging American Soccer market? Did he combine complex demographic knowledge spot Chattanooga on the map and instantly know he'd struck gold? Did he then reach out to throw pittance to some local amateur team?
&gt; 
&gt; Yeah, probably not.
&gt; 
&gt; Bob Martino and Sean McDaniel aren't linked before Chattanooga Soccer that I can remotely figure out.  (Okay there is a hole because I just don't know about Bill Nuttall).
&gt; 
&gt; So who else is controlling the strings here?
&gt; 
&gt; Let's state the obvious - it's USL.
&gt; 
&gt; Who is the real beneficiary of Chattanooga Pro? It's USL of course.
&gt; 
&gt; USL gets:
&gt; 
&gt; * A developer with cash in the the fold
&gt; * A flagship commitment to 3SL
&gt; * ""Likely"" coup de grâce of NPSL Pro, NISA, Independent soccer &amp; possibly CFC
&gt; * Potential for an actual crowd
&gt; * Literally 0 direct risk
&gt; 
&gt; My theory:
&gt; 
&gt; USL finds developers who are interested in ""more than soccer"". 3SL wants to use a soccer stadium as an anchor store on new development. Look at the Greenville &amp; Statesboro plans.
&gt; 
&gt; USL finds a Utah commercial developer in Bob Martino.
&gt; 
&gt; USL has a list of ""markets"" to capture (srsly: read the press releases: it's all ""market"") and Chattanooga makes some intern's list.
&gt; 
&gt; Probably gets escalated as a proven ""market"" &amp; further escalated when they read materials -like mine- about wanting to move up
&gt; 
&gt; USL has spoken with Sean before. Literally part of his job was working to develop leagues. Make no mistake, USL wanted CFC. I heard it directly from Sean over a few years.
&gt; 
&gt; USL might have insight from social media or wherever that it's not all going as planned.
&gt; 
&gt; Big municipal stadium already while we build a ""mixed development anchored by a new stadium"".  4k in the stands &amp; look at this social media saying they want to go pro! Better than that damn Knoxville pitch.
&gt; 
&gt; Bob buys on Chatt thinking he's scored a diamond,
&gt; 
&gt; USL comes to Sean McDaniel with plans &amp; a copy of a check from Bob.
&gt; 
&gt; Sean is nervous about this season, NPSL Pro &amp; a down-tick in attendance.  USL plays on these fears.
&gt; 
&gt; I mean, did you feel that there was any serious movement from independent soccer?
&gt; 
&gt; USL is already closing in on victory in the soccer warz. I personally was about 80% confident in mid season.
&gt; 
&gt; They're talking sweet marketing in Sean's year all summer. USL paints a rosy path forward for CPS.
&gt; 
&gt; They plant a seed - it could be CFC, right?
&gt; 
&gt; ""The deal is done. Join or die"" -is suddenly USL's new tone.
&gt; 
&gt; Sean knows the only way to save CFC &amp; community is convincing CFC to sell -  BUT ALSO getting concessions from Bob to keep some Academy programs &amp; staff that he can.
&gt; 
&gt; The deal is done. Sean is a hero.
&gt; 
&gt; But Sean didn't count on the CFC board circling the wagons, or at least not as effectively as they've done. (hard to blame you in some respects)
&gt; 
&gt; Bob didn't count on community soccer uproar and an initial PR disaster (as a developer, you know that it's never good).
&gt; 
&gt; And maybe USL didn't expect the kind of mobilizing that independent soccer is trying to pull off.
&gt; 
&gt; That 3SL sanctioning press release was supposed to tell you that Chattanooga FC was headlining their new division.
&gt; 
&gt; Instead it read like it's a bunch of MLS2 teams (which it is).
&gt; 
&gt; How are those promises going from the a third party who brought you together? They aren't pulling through on what was promised, are they?
&gt; 
&gt; But you're still being told to stay the course and there are great graphs on why, too.
&gt; 
&gt; You know they have no skin in the game?
&gt; 
&gt; The USL has missed their coup de grâce &amp; the soccer wars may have reignited. 
&gt; 
&gt; Bob Martino and Sean McDaniel - the USL will use your money and reputation to fight their war. They won't give this up as long as your resources exist. They've got your back!
&gt; 
&gt; Will you fight for them?"
97sjn9,1,2018-08-16,Hopeless ugh,bluecowboyboots2,CareerOptimist,https://www.reddit.com/r/CareerOptimist/comments/97sjn9/hopeless_ugh/,"hey guys, lot of finance lingo coming your way sorry. I graduated in December 2018. I worked at a small boutique Investment Bank that mainly specialized in ESOP. I had an offer but I did not want to go back because I have no interest in ESOP.

Since my graduation I have struggled with health issues and have been working on that. They were so bad that it took a toll on my mental health as well.

Here I am now.. a non finance grad (Art History, honestly didn't have a choice with my major, long story) with finance experience, from a target school. I havent really networked in months. at times I am a bit insecure about my major and I just don't know what to do.

As far as internship recruiting, I killed it at recruiting events, and phone interviews, I had multiple super days (final round interviews where I was flown to headquarters) with some great firms, but I did not secure a summer analyst position and ended up at a small firm in Chicago.

Right now, I am feeling like there is no hope. Maybe I am being cynical... I need someone to kick my ass.

Any words of wisdom will help, please. I am a bit overwhelmed."

I was just looking to gain a little more information on what it is like to work in product management. I am currently 21, going into my senior year of college as an English major/psych minor and was curious about possibly entering this feild. If you don't mind me asking:

1) How do you work your way up to be a product manager? Would I be able to get a job with my English degree and internships? Do taking any online product management classes/certifications help?

2) What are the day to day tasks of a product manager? 

3) How stressful is your job, and what do the work hours look like? Is there a work life balance? Do you have to take work home or does work stay at work?

4) How is they pay for these types of jobs? Can you work up the ladder (in the company and pay ladder) quickly? Especially working in non-profit companies, do you take a large pay cut?

5) Where are these types of jobs located? Only near big cities? (I live in MA)

5) Do you find your job fufilling? I read would love a career that has meaning, don't really want to just work for a company to make them money. Want to work to help a cause/create new helpful tech, etc.

Thank you so much!! "
97tks3,22,2018-08-16,I am living the hardest semester I ever been through in my life. Extremely happy and proud I am in this position!,Chock00,CasualConversation,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/97tks3/i_am_living_the_hardest_semester_i_ever_been/,"After dropping university, a year depressed and believing that I was not capable of graduating, I can say I am really proud to be in the position I am today. But I have so much to do.

Right now I'm in the middle of a undergraduate degree I started 2 years ago. I am working one job (for the money) to pay uni and now managed to land in the internship of my dreams: it is the beginning of my career path, so I have 2 jobs. 

I am also studying another language (there's not many opportunities where I live) and doing a course in computer science for my internship (it's an intersection between my undergraduate's area and computer science).

There's so much to do and so little time!

Although I am tired most of the time and my routine leaves no space for going out or just relaxing, I'm so happy with myself!

I followed my dreams and sacrifices were needed to arrive here. This semester will be the hardest I've ever been, but it is worth it and one day I want to be in the position of choosing what I want to do in my life instead of doing something mindlessly just to survive.

In the end of this semester, I will do a little vacation. Spend some time somewhere I can just be."
97tro7,11,2018-08-16,Doubts about my 3-year relationships (late 20s),Pepsiman92,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/97tro7/doubts_about_my_3year_relationships_late_20s/,"Hi all,

This is my first post, I made this account purely for this question and hopefully I’ll get some advice and insight from a third-person perspective. Unfortunately it’s a long post. 

I’ve been with my serious partner (F) for 3-years now. We met whilst partying abroad. I’m English and she’s from the EU. It was love at first sight. We really connected, despite the slight language barrier, and after the holiday we kept in touch. Despite all the difficulties which ensued due to distance, she moved over to be with me after 3-months (It wasn’t viable for me to move to her as I don’t speak her native language and wouldn’t be able to find work). 

After a year I begin to have my doubts. I do love her, and really want to make things work, however I have this ‘FOMO’ complex and I miss being alone, not just for the sexual aspect, also because I’m an introvert by nature and cherish my ‘me’ time. My girlfriend in contrast is more needy, understandably because she’s here for me. She’s really what you’d call ‘wife’ material; gorgeous, caring, loyal, approachable, has good morals however I feel we don’t connect with interests although she tries her best. I feel our conversations are dull and always just playful and joking, making fun of one another lightly etc, but, that’s it - always. I hate to sound harsh, but I find her a bit boring. I also don’t feel sexually attracted to her as much lately. I don’t feel an urge to intiate sex nor act on her advances, however I also don’t have an issue with my sex drive in general. I fear I’m seeing her more as a best friend. I’ve voiced these issues and we had a cry, and she listened and acknowledged my feelings and points - however my negative feelings remain. 

I’m afraid of many things - first and foremost of breaking her heart. I had my heart broken when I was younger and it took me 3-years to overcome the pain and left me depressed. Today I still miss said person however I’ve accepted it - I don’t want anyone to feel the way I did, especially someone who I love. It would also break my heart, because we’ve been through so much together. 
Second I fear that she’ll feel she’s wasted her time. We have a pet together, a house (although the house is mine) and a life - and I’m potentially going to be demolishing everything we’ve built. I have everything if she leaves, and she has nothing a part from memories and less money. It seems unjust. Should we break up, I’d give her some money which I’ve saved in a form of compensation for bills she’s paid.
Third and final I fear that I’ll regret the break up. It’s not a  simple ‘she lives down the road’ kind of relationship, she lives in the EU, she’ll be moving back to her home country and it’d extremely difficult for her to move back if regrets were made and it was repairable, especially with Brexit. 

As I said, I don’t want to just sleep around, I want my freedom and miss my individuality. I miss things being at my pace. I don’t like being labelled as (M) + (F). I’m going to be studying, I’d like to study abroad and do an internship, travel abroad further (we travelled together also for an extended period of time) and have no ties limiting what I can and can’t do, not having to discuss every minute detail and agreeing a mutual compromise. I wouldn’t be posting this if she was from England, but she wants to start a 4-year course in England and I don’t want her to waste her time or money should we split. I also don’t want to hold her back; putting her life on hold because I have these stupid doubts. A quick side note to say my parents love her; they are extremely traditional and judgemental of any actions I take which are not to their liking and they’ll drill into my head that I’ve made a poor decision, despite me not being happy. They won’t talk to me should we break up, not for a time anyway. I fear I’ll be alone, emotionally. 

Another quick note to say she’s back at her native home for 2-weeks. We have a little break, however she’s in complete denial and thinks, despite everything that we’ve discussed, that we’re OK. 

Some help would be appreciated because I feel totally alone in this situation. I feel completely lost. I feel totally selfish and low. 

Thank-you. "

Not the EMT driver, the intern in seasons 8 and 9. She's supposed to be anti-JD (he's an effeminate man, she's a masculine woman) but where JD is able to be ""girly"" without acting like guy stuff is bad, Denise can't go two seconds without insulting something feminine and acting like she's better than everyone.

Plus, she's horrible to the patients. If I just found out my husband was dying and I was struggling with letting him go, and an intern told me I was being selfish twenty minutes later, I wouldn't rest until that little asshole was fired.

I basically cringe whenever she's on screen, and I think I would've liked seasons 8 and 9 a lot more if her character didn't exist, or was played by someone less grating.

What about you?"

Me and my girlfriend came from a coutry area. She always lived on farms.

We are both graduates, but she is disappointed with the area she chose and ended up just completing her compulsory internship.

After 3 years in the same company I ended up being fired and after 1 year unemployed in my city, I had to move to the capital to work.

Well, I came here alone and I had difficulties. Soon after she finished her degree she came to live with me.

I never cared whether she would work or not here, the money I earn allows us to pay our bills and give ourselves some luxuries.

But she spends her days sad, locked at home.

We came from a very quiet place and she can not get used to the city.

She does not feel like going out on weekends, visiting new places or even going on the market with me.

I would like help, but I do not know how, so I would like to hear more opinions.

97vjyx,61,2018-08-16,On System Update Preview Ring Changes,Xbox-Insider,xboxinsiders,https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxinsiders/comments/97vjyx/on_system_update_preview_ring_changes/,"[Today’s blog post] (https://news.xbox.com/2018/08/16/team-xbox-spotlight-yifei-the-xbox-insider-summer-intern/) details new functionality that we’ve incorporated into the Xbox Insider Hub.  Yifei, an intern visiting the Xbox Insider team for the summer, built a service that brings more information and greater clarity to users who are contemplating changing from one system update ring to another.  I recommend that you read the blog post for full information, screenshots, and some bonus information about the internship program at Microsoft.  The short of the post is that you can now see what will happen to your console when you decide to change system update rings.

&amp;nbsp;

Xbox Insider Program staff understand that there is a complex set of variables to consider when releasing new software.  Some people may encounter issues in unique situations, and some people may never experience a problem that other Xbox Insiders are talking about, even in an early ring.  We also understand that sometimes a temporary problem may affect your play style seriously enough to warrant a change to your OS version.  You as readers, as well as r/XboxInsiders mods, have noticed a recent rash of posts loosely titled “I’m leaving the program.”  Some have been conscious decisions that include personal factors, and some have been out of frustration with these temporary issues on early builds.  It is my goal with this post to remind Xbox Insiders that your choice is not a binary In-or-Out of the program, but instead is a spectrum that includes *very* early builds all the way to the Public release.  Your choice of landing place can include any point on that spectrum of builds for which you’re eligible.  Not only that, but there is a significant number of Xbox Insiders that do not take system update flights, but instead are on the Retail/Public build and are utilizing the game flighting options that we offer.

&amp;nbsp;

Yifei's new enrollment feature is yet another step we’re taking to ensure that it’s easy for *you* to decide what’s right for you and your console.  This feature follows a chain of quality of life improvements we’ve made within the enrollment space of the Xbox Insider Hub.  Starting with the ring system, we removed the prior ‘all or nothing’ approach to testing and early build exposure.  Then, by utilizing changes to the roll-back services, we were able to let people move backwards within rings, rather than requiring users to wait until the preview build they were on to become public.  Later, with a change to our back-end processing, we enabled fast changing of rings – changes are *usually* completed within 30 minutes, rather than requiring you to wait until a new build on your destination ring was available.  Now, with today’s feature, you can see information like OS version number and know what will happen to your console’s OS when it’s time to update.

&amp;nbsp;

We love that there are many of you who want to be on the earliest-of-the-early builds.  There are some expectations there – expectations that there could be issues that you face, and expectations that you provide high quality reporting of these issues.  This is a primary reason why we limit the invitations of the early builds to participants that have a history of high quality reporting and feedback.  Even with that said, the Xbox Insider Program team doesn’t consider rings like Alpha and Alpha Skip Ahead to be a status symbol.  Instead, they are important audiences to ensure we bring the best possible software to ALL Xbox players.  This also means that Beta, Delta, and Omega rings **are equally important** to the Xbox Insider Program since an expanding audience membership is going to provide progressively better coverage of temporary problems that could be highly unique, and are things we still want to address before making them public.

&amp;nbsp;

Thank you, Xbox Insiders, for all that you do.  We love the feedback so please keep it coming.  Most of all, our goals are to make the best product on the planet and make gamers happy.

My teacher is super nice, the classes range from awesome to needs improvement, and all the administration has been kind to me, giving tips and tricks. 
One of the best parts: there's a teacher's bathroom separate from the students' bathroom, and it only has one toilet and sink set. Sweet, sweet privacy! My teacher walked me around and introduced me to other teachers as Mr. (Last name) or (chosen first name) and I couldn't stop smiling. I think it's because they're all English teachers; we are more likely to be queer and accepting than other subjects, at least in my experience.
I was worried about passing because I'm a short, pre T guy, but the only issues students seemed to have is believing I was a college student instead of a high school student.
Guys, I was so worried, but everything went well! "

Hello, I’m Rachel. I’m 23 and today I'm looking for a roleplay partner to join me in a sexual scenario based around and office/office work.

Now for this idea, there are many different opportunities, of course there's the boss, coworker, intern, secretary ideas. But maybe give some love to the other guys, the janitors, warehouse employees, and whatever other jobs you could think of? I would be willing to take on more dominant roles like boss/manager, but I definitely play better when I'm sub. But, each to their own.

I would definitely call myself a sub, but, for the correct scene I would be more than willing to attempt a dominant role, although don't expect too much dominance from me haha.

If I'm taking on the role of myself,I will happily give you a relatively detailed description of jolly old me if you'd like one? But I wouldn't mind one in return too?

Now for this idea, I'm totally up for it being a quick one and done, I understand that some people want to have a quick roleplay to blow their load before bed. But, I'm also more than willing for a slower paced, longer term roleplay. I like to think I can handle both of them pretty well with the correct partner.

As for characters, I'd love to have some of your pretences, and eventually come up with a character that is perfect for you.
So yeah, if you're interested in this kinda thing, please message me with either; a character description of who you'd like to play, a scene idea, some kinks, or just a general addition to the roleplay that we could incorporate? Thanks.

Rachel."

Just wanted some advise so decided to poat this.

So, i have worked at the past in a ship brokers small office with an internship programm for only a few months.

Since then i work in an office at the maritime sector again, but with more technical-naval activity.

Me and my good friend, we are working together to this office for many many hours per day and most of the time we also work on weekends and because we are at f***ing Greece we get a shitty wage at the end of the month.

So to turn things around we decided to start a small maritime business although we are still pretty young. We chose broking of course because we have studied it and had also a very small experience as i said before which made us sure that broking is the thing for us.

So after all these my question is: how do you find vessels positions and charterers orders? Where we can get this information? We have studied regarding the firm offers the voyage estimation and all these things but we do not know Where to find orders and positions. Any broker here to help?

Thank you in advance "
97w75o,3,2018-08-16,Becoming a comp / Nuke TD,jntille,vfx,https://www.reddit.com/r/vfx/comments/97w75o/becoming_a_comp_nuke_td/,"Hello everybody,
I've got a question for those that either are Comp / Nuke TD's themselves or know some in the industry. Sadly, I haven't found resources dealing with profession itself, that's why I am turning to you :)
My main question is about how to become a Nuke TD. A little bit of a backstory: I am 21 years old and studying at a media university with a small vfx program. So far, compositing has been my primary focus and I quite like it. But through my comp internship, I somewhat discovered my interest for cool nuke tools and automation. So, I started to teach myself some nuke python in the free time left after work. It came to my mind, that it would probably be an appealing job to work together with a senior artists to realize smart ideas into tools used by artists. The TD's I have spoken with (only a few) are very computer science and math savy, which worries / intimidates me a little bit (as I am not exceptionally good at them, although I have a strong interest for technology). 

My questions: 
- How common is the job of a Nuke TD in mid-sized to large studios? Are those TD's just dedicated to developing comp tools etc., or are they more general TD's with strong math / programming knowledge that hop interdisciplinary between tasks and different software?

How do you actually become a Comp TD (I know ""All roads lead to Rome"", but what are your experiences)? Are there any degree programs besides the TD program at Filmakademie you know of? Do TD's usually come from computer science or through experienced compositors teaching themselves programming on the side, or do bigger studios train and educate own talent from scratch?

How does a typical day in the life of a Comp TD look like? Do you have some examples of tasks you have worked on?

I know those are a lot of questions, but any comment further introducing me the the profession is really appreciated.
Best regards, 
Jan"

I’m missing out on an internship, university and a social life at the moment and just struggling for any sense of normality really.

I know how lovely this community can be and was hoping for some tips and recommendations/suggestions!

Is there any products you swear by to make yourself look better with minimal effort? Any makeup that instantly makes you look less tired? Best moisturiser for a healthy glow? Any must have bath products? That sort of thing :) 

Not bothered about price, just want to pamper myself a bit whilst attempting to look more normal - my wonderful boyfriends insists I’m still beautiful but just finding it hard to feel it! 

Possibly relevant info:

-I’m in the UK 

-am extremely pale (think see through) so dark circles/redness etc are my nemesis lol

-have very long hair but have the horror of it falling out at the moment...trying a men’s caffeine shampoo but products for fullness would also be appreciated! 

Edit: I’ve been blown away but how lovely you guys all are, and how many people can relate, just wanted to say thank you to everyone :D

97wh9a,33,2018-08-16,"30F, trying to rebuild emergency fund and get serious about financial goals",notricktoadulting,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/97wh9a/30f_trying_to_rebuild_emergency_fund_and_get/,"I’m looking for some feedback to my approach to budgeting. I feel like I’m in an OK place with things like retirement savings and debt, but 2018 has had it out for my emergency fund. I’m committed to rebuilding it, but it’s been several years since I’ve strictly budgeted (I know, I know), and I’m in a different place financially at 30 than I was the last time I was keeping close track of my spending, about four years ago.

I’m going to give y’all as much information as possible in hopes that I can do a little bit better in my 30s and start working toward our retirement goals. 

About me: 30F, homeowner, quasi-joint finances with my roommate/BFF/partner – we’re not romantically involved, but two years ago, after a decade of living together as single women, we decided to combine our some of our finances two years ago. ***I know this is an unconventional arrangement, but it works well for us.*** I have the better job and own the home we live in, but I also have severe Crohn’s disease that’s been in active flare for most of the last three years. I manage the household finances and pay for her to have kickass health insurance through my work. She takes care of me when I’m sick. FWIW, I’ve done the estate planning to ensure she’s taken care of if something would happen to me. 

Income: My annual salary is $47,500. I build our budget from what actually gets deposited into my bank account each month, after all deductions – health insurance, retirement contributions, HSA savings, etc. –  approximately $2,750 per month (I get paid monthly). My partner puts $950 into our joint checking account every month.

Pass-through income: I own a 20 percent share in my family’s business but do not participate in the running of it. I have my accountant look at the books every year, but mostly I’m lucky my sister does a fantastic job. I typically net an extra $5,000-8,000 a year, though I try not to rely on this income and do not include it in my monthly budget calculations.

Debt: I owe about $125,000 on the house I bought for $175,000 in 2014. (The market right now is crazy where we live. Comps in our neighborhood have been selling for $240,000 to $275,000, but we’d rather have a house that’s paid off by the time we’re 40 than a fourth bedroom.) We paid off what was left of partner’s student loans last year, and we pay off our credit cards every month.

Retirement: I put in 3 percent of my salary for a 5 percent match, which works out to about $350 per month. I’m also required to contribute 1 percent to a pension fund  as a university employee. Again, all that comes out before I start my budget calculations. But I’ve also maxed out my Roth contributions for the last few years, bringing the total to about 20 percent of my salary. Currently, I have about $21,000 in the Roth and $16,000  between my two work plans. I’m vested in both.

Partner makes her Roth contributions separately. We know she’s behind, but she’s been able to sock away $12,000 on crap wages over the last few years. She’s really frugal – way more frugal than I am – so she’s basically at a place where she if she wants to save more, she’s going to have to make more. I’m really optimistic that’ll happen this year, as her previously undiagnosed ADD is better controlled now.

Health insurance: We have amazing coverage through my employer with a family deductible of $3,000 (which we hit on January 1 this year). Our out-of-pocket max is $6,000 (which we usually hit in February or March). We have about $5,000 in our health savings account. As I’m on a specialty drug with a prescription benefits program that typically pays our deductible for us, it’s unlikely we’ll have to spend down the balance as soon as the new year starts. I don’t take it for granted, though, and continue to contribute $350 per month to our HSA.

Emergency fund: We’ve got about $6,500 cash on hand at the moment – $4,000 in her savings account, $1,500 in my savings account. It’s been a rough year, but some of the depletion couldn’t be avoided, as I’ve been guilty of “retail therapy to make myself feel better about being in the hospital” on a few occasions. I’d like to get my account back above $10,000. ***One of the questions I have is what a realistic timeline for getting that done should be.***

Cars: I’m the primary driver on the 2017 Subaru Impreza (20K miles); she’s the primary driver on the 2011 Chevy Malibu (90K miles). The Malibu used to be mine. We sold her 15-year-old Honda CRV with over 200,000 miles on it when I bought the Impreza. My partner is responsible for repairs on the Malibu (it doesn’t come out of the household income), but I would pitch in if she needed me to. I paid cash for the Impreza and prepaid the maintenance through 2020.

College savings: I have five nephews and two nieces, and I want them to have the help I did funding my education (no student debt). I contribute $60 quarterly to a 529 plan for each of them, which works out to $120-180, depending on the month. I’ve put aside $6,300 for them over the last five years. I anticipate that there will be at least one more niece/nephew in the next couple of years.

Short-term financial goals: 

* Build emergency fund back up to $10,000
* Save $3,000 for an already-booked transatlantic cruise in November 2019
* Set up separate savings accounts for future travel and Christmas so I’m not tempted to dip into emergency funds

Long-term financial goals:

* Pay off the house by the time we’re 40 (extra $100/month, starting in January)
* Continue to max out Roth contribution until no longer eligible (this could be as soon as 2020, if the family business continues to do well)
* Increase contributions to kids’ 529 plans
* Build a modest second home on property we already own at a nearby recreational lake (this might not be possible until we’ve paid off the house in the city, but I’d love to break ground sooner – this is where we plan to retire someday)

How I build the budget: I subtract out fixed expenses first (mortgage, utilities, gas etc.), then regular recurring expenses (like my yoga studio membership), followed by annual membership fees that need to be paid that month (Costco, Amazon Prime, etc.). From there, I determine how much we still have to save/spend. In order, I’ve been allocating money for retirement savings, college savings, groceries, gifts, dining out, entertainment and personal expenses, like clothes. ***Obviously I need to start saving into the emergency fund again, but I know my spending habits well enough to know I’ll fail if I’m too restrictive in quality-of-life categories, like dining out or entertainment.***

So I’ll give you my August budget, minus savings for retirement/emergency fund, as that’s the piece I’m trying to figure out:

INCOME: $3,700

Housing: $1,372 ($1,015 – mortgage/taxes/insurance; $188 – electric; $30 – gas; $65 – water; $74 – mowing, as I’m not physically able to do it anymore)    

Groceries/supplies: $150 (we have an incredibly well-stocked pantry that we’ve decided to eat down over the next couple of months as we try to save)

Subscriptions: $120 ($11 – life insurance on my partner; $50 – Southwest Visa upgrade fee; $14 – monthly contribution to my NPR member station; $3 – extra Apple storage; $12 – web domain renewal; $30 yarn-of-the-month subscription)

Self-care: $199 (this is actually low, as I’m still on surgery restrictions and can’t exercise at the moment – usually it’s $278, which includes $99 for doctor-recommended laser hair removal, $95 for unlimited yoga classes, $84 for a monthly massage plus tip)

Dining: $400 (high this month because I always take my interns out at the end of the summer, and I’m going to Cleveland to visit a friend this weekend)

Entertainment: $150 (high this month because I need to buy gala tickets for the museum where I’m on the young friends board) 

Dog: $0 (he’s really small, so we only buy a big bag of his food every other month, flea collars twice a year, annual check-up in February)

Personal: $35 (I’m swearing off new clothes at least through the end of the year, but I managed to drop my Jackery phone charger in a puddle last month)

Travel: $23 (airport parking for my Cleveland getaway)

Transportation: $245 ($100 – gas; $145 – insurance; I also try to account for any Ubering we plan to do in this category, but there isn’t anything on the calendar this month) 

Gifts: $50 (I budget $25/kid for the nieces and nephews for a book and an educational toy)

College savings: $120 (sometimes $180)

ALLOCATED: $2,864

That leaves me about $800-850 to put into savings/retirement, and that’s really where I need your help: Should I be prioritizing the emergency fund, to hell with maxing out my Roth contribution? Or, since I probably only will be able to put money into my Roth for a few more years, should that still be my priority? I’m not \*counting\* on earnings from the family business, but if I get $5-7K next spring, obviously I can use it to fully fund 2018 (I’ve only been able to put in $2,000 so far this year, stupid Crohn’s) and maybe part of 2019.

I just want to know if I’m doing OK or fucking everything up. I grew up with a lot of privilege, but I didn’t want to go into our family business and took a lower-paying public service job. I LOVE what I do, but I need to make sure my/our lifestyle matches my income, even if it means a reality check."
97wqw0,2,2018-08-16,My girlfriend just broke up with me,twistedveggies,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/97wqw0/my_girlfriend_just_broke_up_with_me/,"Hey guys I'm having some trouble with this one and could use some advice. I will try to keep this short as possible.

So my gf of a little over a year had just ended things with me via text message. She's 19 and I'm 25. We met in college through an internship.  For a majority of the year we lived close to each other and would see each other frequently and we we're really happy. She told me she loved me and that I was her, ""person.""

Fast forward a bit, I got a big time job and had to move 3 hrs away while she still has two years of college to finish. Slowly but surely the distance between us started to affect our communication and we rarely could see each other. I work mon-fri and she usually works weekends. 

Several times I warned her that I am worried she's going to forget about me because shes young and has a lot of experiences and changes to go through. She assured me that would never happen, and it took me a couple weeks of her conving me that we should continue dating.

The past two months though it got worse and worse, until finally I asked her why she was giving me one word answers and barely responding lately. She said she just doesn't feel like continuing the conversation and wants to be alone, I told her that wasn't acceptable, and I would give her space but I asked if we were still together. 

Her response was that she didn't want to string me along and was unhappy, that she changed and our relationship can't be fixed. 

I embarrassingly sent an array of texts asking why because I was very shocked how cold she was being towards me. She said she didn't want to argue and that was her decision. I got angry at first because I literally expressed my concerns with her about this exact situation happening. I was, ""her person,"" how is this so easy for her to do so coldly to me?

I'm having a hard time because I believe that if you love someone and care about them that much then you'll try an make it work no matter the distance or circumstances.. but I guess I was wrong. 

I finally ended up calling her after work but I got no response, I left her a voicemail basically saying it sucks hearing that I don't make her happy but I hope she finds happiness.

My guess is maybe she has met someone else, I asked her if this was the case and she said no, but who knows.

At this point I understand I have to respect her wishes but I'm having a hard time of letting go and moving on, I feel really stupid. "

My concern is that I think that I’m not gonna be able to find a job out of college without having a little more beef on my resume to wow potential employers. 

I currently am in a fraternity and working on getting myself into a executive position. I am also currently VP (most likely going to be president) of a group that focuses on finance/accounting with a large emphasis in investment and currently working with our school to manage a portion of their endowment money. 

I’m also looking into internships as well and have sent my resume and CL to local CPA firms that have alumni working for them. My question to all current accountants, what would be some things I could do to strengthen my chances of getting a job straight out of college? 

Thank you. "
97wwgn,1,2018-08-16,"23 YO, new grad; need advice on where to go from here",TorontoMansEh,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/97wwgn/23_yo_new_grad_need_advice_on_where_to_go_from/,"Hey everyone this is my first reddit post, id appreciate some advice! Maybe other young people in my situation can use the advice to help them out too.

So im 23 and just graduated from university debt free and with $2k in my chequing account from some internships I worked while in school. I just got a job making $65k base (no overtime) and it also offers full employer matching for RRSP contributions up to 7% of total income (also a stock option plan if thats relevant).

As for my expenses, im currently living at home so my only expenses per month are: 

* $60 for cellphone
* $20 for services like Netflix and Spotify
* \~$250 on public transit to commute to work.
* \~$40 - $60 on gas (I drive my moms toyota corolla when I need it, not flashy but does the job)

My overall spending habits care pretty bad though as I will spend around $60 - $100 a week on partying and although I dont go shopping much, I tend to spend more than I should. 

Although my parents have not made mention to anything, I really want to become independent from them and take any bills my dad is paying on my behalf. I also want to move out at some point to Toronto to reduce my commute time which will probably run me \~$1k a month.

I have read that I should first try and save $10k for an emergency fund but other than that I have no clue about where I should put my money to invest/save, how to budget etc. and would really appreciate some advice so I can get a good start to financial freedom.

Thanks!"
97x3f8,7,2018-08-16,why Iida hasnt fallen into irrelevancy,sombrero69,BokuNoHeroAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/97x3f8/why_iida_hasnt_fallen_into_irrelevancy/,"Iida many of us consider him one of our favorites and is arguably one of the main cast and is part of the [original trio] (https://gfycat.com/gifs/detail/ShadyHomelyGelding) with deku and ochaco but lately many have been saying that he isnt what he used to and is more or less forgotten and irrelevant in the story to which i couldnt disagree more.

Iida has had a part wether big or small in most of the arcs of BNHA so far excluding one or too so lets break it down:

- in the battle trial arc he acted his role in the best way possible, analysing his opponent and acting in a way to render her power useless. as momo stated he was the mvp 

- in the USJ arc Iida came in clutch and was the sole reason all might came as he was the [fastest student] (https://gfycat.com/gifs/detail/GlassImmenseLacewing), got all might back in time so he kind of was the reason everyone was saved.

- in the sports festival Iida rejected deku's offer to join his team saying he can't follow deku's lead anymore but instead he'll challenge him as a rival.
   he came in clutch again for his team with last second recipro boost to secure the head band.
   made it to the semi finals of the final stage in the festival only losing to [todoroki] (https://gfycat.com/gifs/detail/ClosedJadedBangeltiger) (arguably the strongest student) but still [put up a good fight](https://gfycat.com/gifs/detail/GrossVacantFennecfox) and shared the 3rd place with tokoyami

- the stain arc was Iida's arc to shine he had his entire character and hero aspirations challenged, if he'll give into rage and seek vengance for his brother or try to forgive and learn how to become a better hero. with deku and todorki there to back him up he gets up and tries to find his way, [""defeating""](https://gfycat.com/gifs/detail/AmusingSneakyDrafthorse) stain with the help of his friends. another thing to note is how he kind of tried having more of an open mind as when later kaminari starts singing stain priases he doesnt mind it and even says that he can see how people can find stain cool.

- The final exam arc was rather [straight forward] (https://gfycat.com/gifs/detail/BlushingBiodegradableArchaeocete) for Iida, he passed.

- my memories of what Iida was doing in Forest Training Camp Arc when the LoV vanguard attacked are a little hazy but i remember him taking out the dirt beasts with deku, todorki and bakugo showing us that he wont [fall behind](http://bokunoheroacademia.wikia.com/wiki/Tenya_Iida/Synopsis?file=Students_vs_the_Earth_Beast.png) them.

- the hideout raid arc is another good arc for Iida since his previous development is being brought up again when his classmates are trying to gosave bakugo themseleves, the same classmates who helped him back when he was trying to pursue villains on his own instead of leaving it to pro heroes and their ideals end up clashing. he reluctantly joins their expedition risking expulsion but goes along with it becuase of his feeling of resposnsiblity being the class president and their friend and helps in the safe rescue of bakugo.

- in the provisional hero license exam we find Iida wandering the field of the first stage just running alone after the class get seperated by vibraty boi, he's running around in the eleventh hour looking for any member of his class that still havent passed while having absolutely no way of knowing if his classmates have passed or not but he keeps looking since he's the class president and he must watchover and help his classmates, until he finds aoyama and encourages him which inspires our twinkly IBS guy to shoot his laser and it becomes a beacon for the rest of the students helping them pass due to the efforts of Iida and aoyama.

- Iida was almost MIA for the next two arcs (the internship arc simce he's not involved and the remedial class arc since he didnt fail) but he and todoroki were there for deku when he was feeling down and i perosnally loved that moment they shared.

- The cultural festival arc was jiro's time to shine and deku had a fight alone were he won without breaking his bones or getting help plus aoyama getting some screen time, all of this with the cultural festival os already alot but the rest of the class got a few scenes here and there including Iida so no he wasn't ignored here, it was just someones else time to shine.

- The pro hero arc is an arc for pro heroes so none of 1-A students except todoroki were involved



for a character that isn't the main character thats alot of screen time but him not appearing in the manga recently is probably the reason for the Iida is forgotten comments. 9/12 arcs looks pretty good to me but like others i hope he gets a center role once again.


tl;dr - contrary to popular belief Iida had his fair share of screen time in most arcs both big and small."

I grumbled and tossed another pinstriped dress shirt on the bed. That one was no good either. There was lipstick on the collar and perfume still wafted up from the fabric in waves, and for a moment I’m reminded of an Asian girl with dramatic eyes whose name I’d already forgotten.

*Now that was a good night.*

I sigh loudly – more of a growl now – and glance at my watch, the heavy silver band catching the light spilling into my condo. You’re three minutes late already. I rake a big hand through my dark brown hair, and continue the hunt for a shirt that is in decent enough shape to wear into the office. There would be a new crop of interns arriving any day, and I didn’t want to poison the well by showing up looking sloppy. My phone buzzes, and the caller ID shows Front desk. The message is brief: **maid on the way up**.

“Fuck. Finally.”

The timing of arriving guests is familiar and predictable. By the time I open my front door, you should just be stepping off the elevator. I flick open the locks and try to remember what your name was.

*Maria? Sofia? Chalupa?*

I actually smiled at that last one.

Looking to play out the predictable - but always sexy - stereotypes. A pretty brown-skinned cleaning girl with a fat ass and perfect cocksucking lips. And a cocky, handsome stud that wants to get off before he goes to work. Let's work out some details and have fun.

I’ve been on my period for 3 weeks now, and I just finally went to the doctor about it. It took me 3 tries because I kept chickening out. I knew I needed to go to the doctor but I just physically couldn’t. I got ready, grabbed my health card and looked up the closest walk in clinic but I just couldn’t do it. My friend had to literally drag me the third time and even when I was in the waiting room I wanted to leave. My mouth got really dry and I just wanted to cry. The doctor is super nice and not scary at all but I still have to force myself to go. I have to have some blood work done as a follow up and I’m scared I’m going to push it aside like I did with the first appointment. 

I’m studying electrical engineering, which I absolutely love. It’s challenging but I love a challenge. I really want to do a year long internship next year so I can save up some money and not have to move back in with my parents after school. I decided to move out for the summer and get a job on campus just to avoid their craziness. My mom sent me a Facebook message about a month ago saying how she was moving away for a while to “focus on her mental health”. What about all the ways she’s hurt my mental health? All the hurtful things she’s said, all the times she blamed me for things out of my control. It really took a toll on me. 

I love to cook, but I don’t. I really enjoy doing my hair and makeup but I rarely do. I put off washing my hair or eating full meals for days on end. Why is this all so hard? I really want to get help but I keep pushing it into the future even though I know it would really help me. 

It’s so easy for me to help others. It makes me so happy to see other people happy. Why can’t I make me happy by helping myself? It’s like I want to be sad all the time.

97xyu2,0,2018-08-16,M4F My Ditzy Bimbo Milf Neighbor,Lastofthealts,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/97xyu2/m4f_my_ditzy_bimbo_milf_neighbor/,"* I like to set the scene before giving the general idea of the story so if you want, just skip down to the last few paragraphs *
         
“Oh my gosh thank you for coming over so fast Ben, I just texted you ” my new neighbor sandra babbled happily as she opened the door for me. She and her husband bob hand moved in a few weeks ago, and she was already my favorite neighbor if you know what I mean. At first I had thought she was just like any other smoking hot suburban milf, but she had soon disavowed me of that notion. The first giveaway was her the myriad of inappropriate outfits she as always wearing. She didn’t seem to have a sense of propriety, and she thought nothing of wearing a skimpy low cut top and skirt when she had me, the 18 year old neighbor over. 

The second thing that tipped me off was the fact that she was always having mishaps with men. Like that one time she explained that her husband didn’t let her come to his office anymore because the interns had convinced her that they had to feel her tits to prove they were real. 

“I just wanted to prove to them that their boss had a naturally hot wife, I don’t know why he was so upset. It’s not like they were trying to feel me up or anything” she had explained. Or that time she called me over, frantic because she was convinced the mole on her inner thigh might be dangerous. Now, that’s not a totally unreasonable request, but she was wearing crotchless panties when I came over to take a look. It had been pure torture as examined her, my head between her legs, the musky scent of her pussy wafting into my nostrils. 

Finally, she just wasn’t too bright all around. Like now, she had called me over because the TV wasn’t working. All it needed was to be plugged into the wall, but she didn’t realize. 

So, she was a Ditz, plain and simple. I hadn’t even tried to take advantage of her as of yet, maybe being late to puberty may have had something to do with that, but the ideas had been steadily building for the last  few weeks, and I knew I didn’t have the self control to stay pure much longer. 

*end of setting* 


Hey all. I think the general idea I’m going for is pretty clear, but I’ll do my best to explain as best I can. I don’t like the typical description of bimbo on her. It’s usually used to mean a cock hungry whore, but that’s not really it. A bimbo is a woman who is perfectly capable of enjoying sex like everyone else, but she’s a bit gullible. She loves her husband, and she recognizes the usual signs of sexual activity. For example, when someone is trying to take advantage of her she’ll usually say something like “oh, but won’t my husband be mad?” But she’s usually easily placated. So I’m looking for someone willing to play that role. If that sounds like something you’d be up for, I can wait to talk. "

Thankfully still think I am on track towards a Bachelor's in May. Had a mixture of blessing and curses in my life. Was bullied a lot in elementary but made really great friends outside of school and remained best friends in junior high. Then in my early teens my mom committed suicide, forcing a quick move in with her sister halfway across the country. High school years were also a mixture of good and bad but I felt empty feeling like I don't belong anywhere as I has no consistamt lifelong relationships at that point. Then I decided to move in with another member right after I graduated high school..to fill apparent emptiness. I really feel like these last three years have more or less gone to waste. I've progressed through a tough STEM online degree but really haven't felt any payoff from it. Was rejected from the several internships I applied to. I am not even passionate able academia or the field I'm in. Still feeling empty as ever. Completely dazed by the fact that I haven't spoken to my aformentioned best friend in a couple years to find out that she just got married. I am happy for her of course. But it shocked me. I feel like all these years have just been a giant haze and I am the only one who hasn't grown. The pressure of graduating college and somehow finding an entry level job is overbearing. In all actuality the only simple life I can think of myself being happy in is one by the ocean. I feel like I am working so hard for the life I was taught I should have but I don't really know what I want. I would love to travel the world but I can't take the amount of pressure I put on myself to make that happen. There's nothing I like about mundane existance. "
97ye4o,2,2018-08-16,Advice?,justadirtydude122,bisexual,https://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/97ye4o/advice/,"This is gonna be a pretty long one, and would appreciate any advice, especially from those who have experienced any of this. This is mostly just me throwing out as much as I can, take it as you will. 

I’m a 20 year old guy, and after living alone this summer for an internship, I realized I was bi. I kind of suspected this my whole life, but because I’m generally masculine and a pretty vanilla guy no one (including me) would think I’m bi (normal hair, bland sense of style, tall and kind of muscular, low voice, engineer, not liberal/progressive). 

In terms of my sex life, I’ve only ever kissed a girl, probably because I’m kind of awkward and my family generally starts dating after college (idk why, but this is the case for pretty much my whole extended family) so I just never grew up with the idea that it was something I should be focusing on. Porn always did the job too. 

My first concern is about coming out. I have a core group of friends at home and at college, and I know they have my back no matter what. However, I fear (probably unwarranted) that things would just become more awkward with my friends, especially because we’re minorly homoerotic with each other (butt slapping and random sex sounds, dumb shit like that). Can anyone share if their relationship changed with their male/same sex friends after coming out, or is this just a silly concern?

Also, I wanna have sex. I’m an at least somewhat attractive guy (6’ 180 llbs) and I’m pretty sure what’s kept me from having more intimate experiences is confidence, even though I’m pretty confident in general. All my friends have had sex (not the reason I want to) and it’s not like I was raised very religious or anything. I don’t flirt with any girls (like I said, I’m awkward and just never had that in my mind as something to initiate). Haven’t had many close female friends also. Has anyone here become more confident/gotten with more women/men after they realized they were bi/came out?

How do I find guys? I’m not someone who’s going to come out super publicly or anything because I’m a low key person, probably just gonna eventually tell my close friends, then family, then continue my life as usual. Like I said, no one would think I’m bi. 

Other stuff:
I still see myself wanting to marry a woman later in my life, does that mean anything? [edit 5 minutes after OP: I also fear that because it’s so much easier to hook up with gay guys than straight girls, I’ll become de facto gay because it’s easier]

Where I live and go to school, being bi/gay won’t be an issue for 98% of people. 

I have a bi friend just outside my closest circle of friends. Is that a good place to come out to start? He’s been known to have a kind of loud mouth in the past (especially when drinking, which he does a lot because college), is this something that I could definitely trust him with because he knows similar experiences? 

I also have anyone friendly acquaintance from high school, who I talk to 2 or 3 times a year usually around other friends. He’s bi but we were never very close just in the same friend group, would he understand if I just reached out to talk about this? Maybe I’m asking for a huge generalization about bi people, but just wondering. 

I’ve read on here that dad jokes are a bi culture thing? I’m a very dad joke guy, but where does this come from?

I’m a stoner

————-

I really don’t know how this post reads to you guys, but although I’ve been thinking about all of these things, my life has generally just been the same since I realized I’m bi. They’ve been in my mind, but since relationships and sex aren’t usually a part of my life I have been doing things as I usually do, just a little happier to have figured some of this out. 

Would definitely appreciate PMs from those who relate to any of this. Probably will respond tomorrow.

97yia6,4,2018-08-16,Career Advice - Engineering,dienqueen,Calgary,https://www.reddit.com/r/Calgary/comments/97yia6/career_advice_engineering/,"Hey guys, 

Long time lurker. I think this page and r/engineering are good resources for advice and opinions. So I'll give both a shot.

Dilemma: should I take an engineering new grad job (based in the Montney) or should I decline it and try to search for other opportunities in Calgary?

Background: I'm a final year engineering student who will be graduating next May. I have done 20months of internships with Company A, B and C. Currently I am working for Company C on my last work term and am based in the Montney region of Alberta doing natural gas operations. Company A and B were oil sands mining (Fort McMurray) and SAGD (Calgary based), respectively. I recieved an offer to return to Company C for full-time EIT/New Grad Program after I graduate. Their new grad program stipulates that I work supporting operations in the field as an engineer (based somewhere in Grande Prairie) before rotating every 1-2yrs to different business units in Calgary. However, I'm very conflicted. 

Here's why: I enjoyed working for all three types of industries and companies equally. However, with the recovery (albeit moderate) happening in Calgary, I'm hesitant to take this offer. The offer in question is to spend 1-2 years supporting a site up in Grande Prairie or Dawson Creek. This would mean moving here for that length of time. After the two years or so, I would be rotated into a different department in Calgary, as part of their new grad program. The problem is that I only have till early September to decide (at the latest, since I'm waiting for paperwork, etc). This doesn't give me much time to explore my other options since most EIT postings happen in Sept. Should I take the safe route and accept or should I gamble and try to get a similar job but be based in Calgary? 

My goal is to just get my PEng first before deciding on what type of career I'd like. Perhaps grad school down the road or an exit from engineering altogether. Im really not sure. One thing I am sure of is that I should be focusing on getting my PEng as soon as I can, since that's what I have spent the last 5yrs studying to become. My family and friends are all in Calgary and moving away for 2yrs is going to be tough. Especially since I'll be living in a relatively remote place (compared to Calgary) while not knowing anybody. I'm also sure the pay across these types of companies are comparable, so money is not a problem. I'm honestly even ok with 7 days on, 7 days off, fly in fly out type of work.

I'm torn between taking the offer (safe bet) or declining it and searching for better Calgary based opportunities. I know that if I decline the offer, I'll be doing interviews during the school semester, which may be stressful. Plus, having a job already lined up is such a huge relief off of any student's shoulders. I also understand that for engineers, getting the field experience and hands on experience is very beneficial, which may worth toughing out the 2yrs. I just really don't want to live somewhere remote with no friends for 2yrs.

With the moderately receiving economy, what do you guys think of my dilemma and what would you do in my shoes? 

Thanks !"
97ykuk,12,2018-08-16,Next week makes one year since we split...,Blabernathy,UnsentLetters,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/97ykuk/next_week_makes_one_year_since_we_split/,"...and I can't believe how far I've come without you.  

At first I was wanting to improve myself in the hope that in September you would see how much I've changed and we could try us again.  But when I found out that you were already seeing someone else, fucking him in the bed that we bought together, letting him live in the house we bought together, letting him play with our dogs when I haven't seen them since February, I kind of lost it.  Sure, I picked myself up and started working toward a better me, but I still was clinging to the hope that one day I'd wake up next to you.

I couldn't have seen it coming, but this summer was truly a huge transformation for me.  I discovered so much about myself mentally, emotionally, physically, and especially sexually.  I've stumbled into meeting myself and I had no clue this cool guy even existed.  Even as I type this out, I'm smiling thinking about where I am now compared to this past winter.

I'd wake up wishing I was dead.  I'd go through my day hoping some freak accident would take my life.  I'd even go as far as to wonder if C and the kids were dead and I wasn't aware of it, then I could kill myself and not feel bad about leaving them behind.  I didn't care about my future.  I'd hit the gym, I stopped drinking hard.  I got fit and healthy, but my heart and mind were still broken.  I finally went to a legit therapist instead of just a stupid unqualified VA counselor.  In addition to again being diagnosed with PTSD, seems I have clinical depression.  Apparently it goes hand-in-hand with PTSD, but I may have had it since I was a kid.

I took a risk and decided try anti depressants.  Yeah, I know, me taking medication.  And you know what?  It was the best fucking choice I have ever made.  My method of thinking has changed and now I wake ready to crush every single day.  I'm a year out from finishing school AND I've been given the opportunity to possibly intern at a lobbyist firm.  Things are coming up blabernathy.  

Last thursday I was at my fav bar (you know the one).  I walked from the bar to the pool tables to give my buddy a little shit.  It took me ten min to get back to my seat because I kept getting stopped by people who wanted to talk to me.  Men and women, older and younger, people who wanted to just say what's up.  Hell, I was getting hit on by girls way younger than me.  And the best part is I didn't even want the attention.  I spent so long defining my self worth off of somebody else's love that I never tried to love myself.  That night I walked in feeling like a million bucks and I left feeling like a billion.

I love who I am now.  I'm fit, attractive, intelligent, charismatic, and finally genuine to myself.  I know I have so much love to give and finally feel like I deserved to be loved.  Seriously, can you believe this?  I'M saying this about myself.  I finally love myself and I actually mean it.  

I finally dug out that box of birthday and xmas cards you had given me.  I read all of them one last time, savored the memory, smelled your sweet perfume, then took them out and threw them away.  I deserve loving more than a memory.  I've been kind of seeing that tall girl a few doors down.  She gets me and we spent this summer connecting.  Took you about six months to see inside of me.  She got me down in 48 hours.  I didn't think I could ever love again, and now I find myself thinking about her like I used to think about you.

I know you won't ever see this; you don't get on reddit.  And there was a time when I would have loved for you to see how happy and healthy I am today.  But the best feeling that I've gotten today is feeling fan-fucking-tastic and not giving two fucks if you know or not.  

Be happy, Concrete.  Live your life and enjoy it, you deserve it.  Know I'll always love you just as much today as I did when we were alone on July 4th by the Valle.  But don't act like you know me when we see each other. "

980htd,0,2018-08-17,[M4F/Futa] Game of Thrones Porn Edition!,Throwawayforblackk,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/980htd/m4ffuta_game_of_thrones_porn_edition/,"**I'm an adult looking for another adult for adult fantasies.**

**One liners will be ignored, please put some effort into your PM as I have done with this post. Kinks, limits, general idea of what you want, things like that are a good start! Also, fair warning, I prefer big &gt; small when it comes to dick sizes. So if big dicks ain't your thing, this might not be for you.**

Hey there! So like many others out there, I'm a huge fan of Game of Thrones, both the show and the books (what I've read of them at least!) so I figured.. Why not make a post about it and see what happens, right? Also, I should note I'd be happy to do either rule34 (aka inside of the GoT world) or with the stars themselves in a more celeb type of prompt, if that makes sense!

I'm also very much a switch, so can take the dominant or submissive role.. Or we can just switch things around.  I do prefer long term things mostly due to time zones. A rp could be short in terms of content or something much longer depending on idea!

This will be pairings around a young guy and one or more of the GoT women. However, I'd be quite happy to throw gender bending into the mix to make things more fun. What if Joffrey was a bratty queen instead of king? Things like that. Will make it clear as well, if you wish for one of the women to be packing some extra heat between her legs, that's totally fine but then the boy involved will 100% be a femboy/girly boy/ whatever you wish to call them.

But regardless, will throw out some ideas that might work. Would be happy to change them around and make them better, and of course open to new ideas! Ideas will be both rule34 and normal.

**Repaying the breaker of chains:** So Daenerys Targaryen freed quite a lot of slaves throughout her conquest. But what if one of those freed was a young guy that wanted to repay  her for being freed? Could be someone who comes into her throne room asking how he can do it, can be some cute thing she sees when walking the streets with her guards. There's a lot of ways for her to meet said freed slave! But for one reason or another, she figures it could be good to let the eager guy thank her.. Just that she didn't quite expect the way he wanted to do it. Or was she the one suggesting it?

**Over the wall:** Now you might question how a young guy ended up on the northern side of the wall.. Well.. That's a story for another time. What's more important is the fact that he ran into the wildlings, or even more importantly that he didn't get an arrow in the back the second he was found. That was thanks to the fact that Ygritte was the one that found him.. And well.. She wanted to try something new in bed that wasn't a wildling, just to see how it felt.

**Perks of being an intern:** Everyone knows that Maisie and Sophie are great friends outside of the show with all the stuff they do on social media and whatnot. But what if they both put their sights on that young intern that they had seen before? The one that had a suspiciously phallic shaped bulge in his pants despite the fact he looks so damn innocent. Well, they do everything together, so why not do the young intern together, eh?

**Outfits!:** Surely Lena Headey wasn't the only one thinking it would be fun to fool around while wearing those fancy looking outfits and the makeup, right? And what better way to do it than in your private dressing room before or after a shoot, before getting rid of it. And who better to do it with than that cute guy that you know would never tell a soul if you ask him not to? I mean.. What's there to lose?

So yes, some quick ideas there that might or might not be fun! Again, open to new ideas and open to changing the ones I wrote out as well. In fact I do have more ideas in mind but didn't want to make this post too long.

For kinks, I'm a bit more on the vanilla side than a lot of people of the various rp subreddits. I have a handy kinks list here [https://i.imgur.com/gSLXo8k.png](https://i.imgur.com/gSLXo8k.png) . Please note that if taking on the submissive role with a futa, some stuff that's marked as a 'no' turns into a yes! But to give a quick example.. Anal, oral, rule34, celebs, titfucks, rough sex, clothed sex, public sex, casual nudity/sex, romance (don't judge!), big cocks/ass/breasts, size difference, creampies.

Limits are the usual. Gore, snuff, blood, vomit, scat, watersports, non-con, feet etc etc etc.

..I think that about covers it! I feel like I've missed something somewhere but can't quite put my finger on it. Anyway, if you feel like any of this is interesting to you, hit me up with a PM with the 'Game of Thrones lewds' as the title so I know that you've at least read this part!"
980jvj,3,2018-08-17,I just need to say this (my life's story over the past few months),throwawaypost999,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/980jvj/i_just_need_to_say_this_my_lifes_story_over_the/,"tl;dr Since January, each of my already separated parents has gotten a divorce, my mom has turned into an extreme tiger mom, my sisters were violated and molested by my dad, and my dad has kidnapped my 6-year old sister and skipped town with hints of suicide.

Before I get into what I've been going through, I want to say that I am currently going through therapy and my therapist has recommended I post my troubles anonymously online to help me since he knows I use reddit as a way to cope with life. Therefore, this post will be me telling my story to look for advice and to help relieve some of the weight.

If the me from a year ago looked at me now, I would be unrecognizable. Over the past few months, a series of major life changes that I have gone along with have left me with some insomnia, eating problems, depression, and severe anxiety (not diagnosed yet, but I will have the diagnosis by next week). As a bit of background, I am entering my senior year of high school after skipping my sophomore and junior year (due to my mom; more later) and would consider myself competitive for top schools. My mom's family is from Mexico, so she wants us to get the best education possible, but she ends up putting a lot of pressure on me and my two sisters to do well in school to the point where anything below a 97% is unacceptable.  She constantly micromanages my studying, makes sure I will be valedictorian, made me take the SAT until I got a 1560, and made me take more classes this summer than I did in all of last school year. My parents got divorced about 11 years ago and both quickly remarried. My dad was abused growing up and has a history of being violent with my mother, which is why she left. I have been going between houses every week as part of the divorce agreement, but my mom has custody of me and my sisters.

Now for what happened over the last few months. My troubles all started in January when my mom got a divorce from my step-dad after he was caught stealing from her company and cheating on her. This caused my mom to shut down and go into a deep depression. I was fine at this point because I was never attached to my step-dad, but my mom started to focus all of her frustrations and anger on me by controlling every aspect of my life and forcing me to study and not allowing me to do anything with my friends (isolating me in my room with prep books and cancelling all of my plans). This went on for a few months until she found a new boyfriend, but once she did, she started giving him all of her attention and forgetting about me and my sisters (ex. not buying food for several days because she forgot, forgetting the plans we had for months to go on a date, etc.).

Around the same time, problems started occurring at my dad's house. One of my sister's friends found a video camera that was hidden in her room and I had found several in other private locations. My dad dismissed these as ""alarm systems"", but we all knew what they were. A few weeks later, we went on a vacation where I slept in the same room as my sisters (nothing abnormal). On the last night of the vacation, one of my sisters (technically my step-sister from my step-mom) was told to sleep in my dad's room (with my step-mom there too). I later asked why and my dad told me it was because I had ""touched my sister inappropriately"" the night before. This was a shock to me because nothing like that happened and my other sisters were up later than me and defended me; but he didn't listen.

Fast forward a week later and my dad was engaged in another screaming match with my step-mom and somehow I had become involved. A lot of things were said that I felt had threatened my safety, so the next morning, I woke my (biological) sisters, we packed our bags, and we went to school. That afternoon, we were supposed to return to my dad's house. But because none of us felt safe there, me and my sisters took the bus to my mom's house. When he found out where we were (he tracks our phones), he furiously called and rushed over to come get us. Because we were scared of what he might do if my dad managed to get us in his car, we called the police. When the police arrived, we informed him of the situation and said we refused to go over to my dad's house. When my dad arrived, he had a talk with the police officer and quickly sped away.

I have now been living with my mother for about 4 months, but since then, a lot has happened at my dad's house. It has come out that he was videoing and molesting/raping my step-sister (which is what was happening earlier in the hotel), my step-mom is getting a divorce, and naked videos of one of my biological sisters was distributed online. After all of this coming to light, my dad skipped town with my 6-year-old sister and cannot be found or contacted. The FBI and CPS have been looking for him for a while, but he has so far evaded arrest. The scary part is, the week before he left, he was dropping hints of suicide and talked about who was in his will, the fact that life insurance covers suicide, sadness, and the inevitability of death a lot.

On top of all of this, I am managing 3 internships, countless awards, college essays, a blog, coding, 8 summer classes, getting eagle scout, pressure from my mom, and maintaining a cheery outward composure while I'm crumbling inside. I have been interviewed by CPS several times and have had several breakdowns and slumps of bad depression. My mom has taken notice to this and put me in counseling, but I'm still having a lot of difficulties coping with all of this. I try to keep myself happy by saying stuff like ""If I make it through, this would make one hell of a movie/book/autobiography"" and ""one more year of school and you can move to California and it will all go away"", but deep down I really wonder if I can do it. My sisters have also taken this really hard with one on pills after being diagnosed with depression, and the other sad all the time.

I know this has kind of turned into a rant/me venting, but over the hour it has taken me to write this, I feel I've calmed down significantly like some of the load is released, so thank you for reading. I would appreciate any advice or positive comments that are not hotlines or medical help (I already have that much covered by my counselor and therapist) because my mom has destroyed all of the friendships that I could really use right now to talk about all of this. Thanks!"

but after bottling it up for so long i can't help but you know if there is someone  
out there reading is . Thank you for your time

hello nice to meet you . i'm a student **(19**) soon to hit her twenties   
i grew up in the Netherlands while my parents are from Turkey  
ive been raised by my single mother in an old moldy house.  
living along side my two bro's and my mother we all shared one  
bedroom . i remember it being very cramped. a plus side  
to the house we had a big backyard leading straight to the park  
it would get visited by animals to like cute lil baby hedgehogs.  
However it wasn't save for us . our neighbour was a alcoholic  
and around middnight we could never sleep well. because of   
the ruckus he was causing . 

since our backyard's doors were  
rotten and unstable homeless would invade our home. my single mom  
had to deal with it daily trying to shoo them away .to protect  
her 3 little children ,who she gave up her life for. Fortunately  
my aunt would help us out financially. My grandpa had lots of kids  
7 to boot . one big family right its usual for us Turkish to have  
a big family . The youngest or my uncle i remember him always  
throwing me up in the air as if i was flying. I would usually   
stay at my granny's place where he and my youngest aunt live . 

i remember watching pokemon the very first season .whenever  
my granny would go away for morning prayer with my mum . i would just  
sit there .My uncle would join me and talk about things i couldn't comprehend   
back then we had a bit of a age gap he would talk about things like conspiracy's politics  
i was still in elementary school and only thought about stuff like waterbaloons like  
any other kid. one day something weird happened. You guys know those twister pop candy?  
with a price in them . i was sitting on the couch eating it like any other normal kid  
suddenly my uncle came up to me and asked if he could have a bit too. i reached the  
candy out him and he suddenly forced himself on me he shoved his disgusting  
tongue and frenched her niece till this day.. i deny that that was my first kiss  


what's even more weird is that i'm typing this so easily . i think i failed at being human  
or i am just broken and can't function. i was naive back then i did'nt know about stuff  
like that i was just your usual child looking up that big blue sky dreaming about ten years  
later. as time passed our relationship grew weirding he said bad things about my mum  
saying how the divorce was because of him. i was doubting my mother and began to trust   
his words , As she was mentally very unstable  . so i sticked to him this time we would   
spend time in his bedroom . in his Bedroom he had a PC being the kid i was i wanted   
to play with it .But it had it's conditions . those conditions were. that this kid with innocent blue eyes  
how i feel bad for her . Had to bent down on his bed edge get her face smushed under a pillow  
and what followed next? what could follow next. i recall feeling heavy weight on me   
and the dry air on my bared skin. what's even more disgusting is that i had no idea what   
was going on as if being possesed i accomplied to his sickening commands. 

i had times where i tought . that there were girls who were worse off othan me  
or experienced the same thing. let's fast forward a bit further in time  
On school acording to my teachers i had delayed speech i was a late bloomer   
in class . The teacher prepared a very hard equation for everyone of us  
it was something like what'' 11 multiplied by 11. i wasn't very good at numbers  
to begin but i did my homework everyday i could. i practised with my brothers  
as well. but it was still me out of 24 pupils i was the one 1 percent who had the   
wrong answer while all of them had the right answer.  I cried and detested myself  
so much wondering why i am like this. what's wrong with me. god i try my best  
why am i being denied by everyone when i strife to be just like them.

around the year of 8 i would began stuttering my mother would bring   
me to a speech therapist who i basically grew up with till i was 12 .That's where  
the training ended and so i cut ties with who i considered to be my second mom.  
the stuttering only got worse i got alienated at school whenever i would raise my  
hand i could feel my teacher skipping me un purpose.since then i detested math so much  
but seeing how everyone in the group contributed i tried being part of it.   
but the more i tried the more they denied me. they looked like having fun  
while i could only watch them from over my shoulders. i had one best friend  
this girl as cliche as it sounds was the smartest girl in our class she excelled at everything  
i slowly felt i didn't deserve her so i tried to make up for my wortlesness my   
being selfless . i felt like a burden so for her b-day i got her the most expensive things  
i was grateful having such a strong witted person next to me. she was a year younger  
yet she felt like an older sister. maybe its because i was lacking in everything.

there was another girl who was with us she was glamerous not shy she would also  
hang out with us. You know that feel when your best friend suddenly smiles more than  
usal has overal a better time with others. That's the wost feeling as a kid. after that   
it felt like i was forcing her to be my friend so i got distant being the smart person   
she was she noticed it ofcourse i pulled me back from that time our group would  
just grow bigger soon another new girl showed up being the youngest out of us she was very shy but we became friends  shortly after ,we exchanged numbers and grew very attached of eachother.  
to my surprise  i would stutter less around them. that warmth made me forget  
about my whole home situation my future my past my worries. On graduation  
day we had to part ways i was crying alone in the park with a lake it was a  
place i would visit often to clear my mind.

 I dont know how but somehow   
my friends knew i was crying and got to the park asap . chasing after eachother playing tagg all of the sudden  
acting goofy . i could only scream ""oh my god!""  i could never forget such a vivid memory. i guess my  world   
needed balance and tried to tell me that bad things happen but good things will patch them. that's how   
i lived my life until now. but now everything is just a shithole  from losing my only friend who couldn't even make it trough middleschool (she was the youngest out of us and would brighten my day we grew we even closer in middleschool)     
 to facing my rapist uncle every time  
we have a family reunion taking selfies as if nothing happened. my stutter stayed with me   
he  even made fun of it in front of the whole family. Do you ,you normal people  
have to hold back everytime you know  an answer do you have to choke up everytime it's your  turn  
do you have to keep hearing from your scumbag dad   how you don't  amount  to anything Did you have to  
call him for money because you can't find a parttime job and need it for tuition. Did your teachers connect you to every white collared  
blonde school counselor. Do you had to worry about burdening your friends with befriending someone who stutters  
did you have to face a dozens of rejections and getting denied by every company that offer internship. Do you   
feel like you could be better of not exsisting. i  can name hundreds of reasons to kill myself but that would   
just dissapoint her in Heaven and the me that  looked up up that big bluesky. The me with big blue  eyes which gradually turned into grey . 

*grow up* says the little voice in my head ,

i have grown up ,now what do i do next?

I got my first real job related to my field of study, and it's in my girlfriend's home city. During the school year, I'm five hours away; now, at worst with traffic and everything, I'm 30 minutes away. I've been seeing her every day. I can just come pick her up after work and bring her back to my apartment or back to her house. We both have full time jobs, and with it, the money to go on dates and adventures. We've been camping at some beautiful places and traveled to some bucket list sites.

Earlier in the summer, I mentioned to her that it was great being able to say no to hanging out. During the school year, if we had to postpone or cancel a monthly visit, I'd be heartbroken and let down a lot. But now, with her being so close and seeing her every day, it's kind of nice to be able to say no to seeing her, because it's not a big deal. With her so close, I can see her every day and if one date doesn't work out, there's plenty of other opportunities.

Today is the last day of my summer internship, and I'm moving back home. Home is closer o her than school, not too much of a drive, but school itself starts up soon after. And I'm just not ready for it.

I just got comfortable living the good life and being with her all the time, and seeing her every day for about two months. Now I'm going to have to go back to missing her every day and driving five hours just to give her a hug in person.

Fuck this. I'm ready for school to be over already."

At that time, little did we know where this path would lead us. As a result, we were blessed to interview Professor Thomas Jeffrey, Senior Editor Emeritus of the [Thomas A. Edison Papers at Rutgers University.](http://edison.rutgers.edu/)

Professor Thomas Jeffery was extremely gracious and open to granting an interview on [Thomas Edison](https://falconerelectronics.com/inventions-thomas-edison/). A subject that he has researched extensively for almost 40 years. For more information, [click here to check out a recent blog that includes a quick bio](https://falconerelectronics.com/thomas-jeffrey/) and introduces Professor Thomas Jeffrey.

## Thomas Edison Connection to Chautauqua Institution

As we started our [blog series](https://falconerelectronics.com/category/edison-family-project/) on the [Edison Family](https://falconerelectronics.com/edison-family-facts/), we discovered a local connection with Thomas Edison and his amazing wife [Mina Miller Edison](https://falconerelectronics.com/mina-miller-edison-edisons-wife/) to Chautauqua Institution. While connecting with the [Chautauqua Institution Archives](http://chq.org/about-us/archives), our research led us to the Edison Papers at Rutgers University.

[Miller Family Papers to add Chautauqua chapter to Edison Project](https://chqdaily.wordpress.com/2012/08/26/miller-family-papers-to-add-chautauqua-chapter-to-edison-project/)

Mina Miller Edison's father, [Lewis Miller](https://www.nps.gov/edis/learn/historyculture/lewis-and-mary-valinda-miller.htm), co-founded [Chautauqua Institution](https://falconerelectronics.com/chautauqua-institution/) during the summer of 1874. Fast forward 144 years later, [Chautauqua Institution](http://chq.org/) continues to thrive delivering an [amazing lineup every summer season](http://chq.org/season). Chautauqua Institution welcomes over 100,000 visitors each summer who explore spirituality, philosophy, cultural vitality and the arts. In addition, c[lick here to learn more.](http://chq.org/index.php)

As a college senior as well as working as a social media intern, learning about the incredible life of [Mina Miller Edison](https://falconerelectronics.com/miller/) led to a great deal of inspiration and an eagerness to explore deeper.

As a result, we learned Mina strongly [valued education](https://www.nps.gov/edis/learn/historyculture/mina-miller-edison.htm). Therefore after graduating from Akron High School, Mina continued her education at the Miss Abby H. Johnson's Home &amp; Day School for Young Ladies in Boston.

My Interview with Professor Thomas Jeffrey

This interview was made possible thanks to [Jonathan Schmitz, archivist](http://chq.org/about-us/archives) of [Chautauqua Institution](http://chq.org/).

984l1k,1,2018-08-17,I just need to say this (My life's story over the past few months),throwawaypost999,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/984l1k/i_just_need_to_say_this_my_lifes_story_over_the/," tl;dr Since January, each of my already separated parents has gotten a divorce, my mom has turned into an extreme tiger mom, my sisters were violated and molested by my dad, and my dad has kidnapped my 6-year old sister and skipped town with hints of suicide.

Before I get into what I've been going through, I want to say that I am currently going through therapy and my therapist has recommended I post my troubles anonymously online to help me since he knows I use reddit as a way to cope with life. Therefore, this post will be me telling my story to look for advice and to help relieve some of the weight.

If the me from a year ago looked at me now, I would be unrecognizable. Over the past few months, a series of major life changes that I have gone along with have left me with some insomnia, eating problems, depression, and severe anxiety (not diagnosed yet, but I will have the diagnosis by next week). As a bit of background, I am entering my senior year of high school after skipping my sophomore and junior year (due to my mom; more later) and would consider myself competitive for top schools. My mom's family is from Mexico, so she wants us to get the best education possible, but she ends up putting a lot of pressure on me and my two sisters to do well in school to the point where anything below a 97% is unacceptable. She constantly micromanages my studying, makes sure I will be valedictorian, made me take the SAT until I got a 1560, and made me take more classes this summer than I did in all of last school year. My parents got divorced about 11 years ago and both quickly remarried. My dad was abused growing up and has a history of being violent with my mother, which is why she left. I have been going between houses every week as part of the divorce agreement, but my mom has custody of me and my sisters.

Now for what happened over the last few months. My troubles all started in January when my mom got a divorce from my step-dad after he was caught stealing from her company and cheating on her. This caused my mom to shut down and go into a deep depression. I was fine at this point because I was never attached to my step-dad, but my mom started to focus all of her frustrations and anger on me by controlling every aspect of my life and forcing me to study and not allowing me to do anything with my friends (isolating me in my room with prep books and cancelling all of my plans). This went on for a few months until she found a new boyfriend, but once she did, she started giving him all of her attention and forgetting about me and my sisters (ex. not buying food for several days because she forgot, forgetting the plans we had for months to go on a date, etc.).

Around the same time, problems started occurring at my dad's house. One of my sister's friends found a video camera that was hidden in her room and I had found several in other private locations. My dad dismissed these as ""alarm systems"", but we all knew what they were. A few weeks later, we went on a vacation where I slept in the same room as my sisters (nothing abnormal). On the last night of the vacation, one of my sisters (technically my step-sister from my step-mom) was told to sleep in my dad's room (with my step-mom there too). I later asked why and my dad told me it was because I had ""touched my sister inappropriately"" the night before. This was a shock to me because nothing like that happened and my other sisters were up later than me and defended me; but he didn't listen.

Fast forward a week later and my dad was engaged in another screaming match with my step-mom and somehow I had become involved. A lot of things were said that I felt had threatened my safety, so the next morning, I woke my (biological) sisters, we packed our bags, and we went to school. That afternoon, we were supposed to return to my dad's house. But because none of us felt safe there, me and my sisters took the bus to my mom's house. When he found out where we were (he tracks our phones), he furiously called and rushed over to come get us. Because we were scared of what he might do if my dad managed to get us in his car, we called the police. When the police arrived, we informed him of the situation and said we refused to go over to my dad's house. When my dad arrived, he had a talk with the police officer and quickly sped away.

I have now been living with my mother for about 4 months, but since then, a lot has happened at my dad's house. It has come out that he was videoing and molesting/raping my step-sister (which is what was happening earlier in the hotel), my step-mom is getting a divorce, and naked videos of one of my biological sisters was distributed online. After all of this coming to light, my dad skipped town with my 6-year-old sister and cannot be found or contacted. The FBI and CPS have been looking for him for a while, but he has so far evaded arrest. The scary part is, the week before he left, he was dropping hints of suicide and talked about who was in his will, the fact that life insurance covers suicide, sadness, and the inevitability of death a lot.

On top of all of this, I am managing 3 internships, countless awards, college essays, a blog, coding, 8 summer classes, getting eagle scout, pressure from my mom, and maintaining a cheery outward composure while I'm crumbling inside. I have been interviewed by CPS several times and have had several breakdowns and slumps of bad depression. My mom has taken notice to this and put me in counseling, but I'm still having a lot of difficulties coping with all of this. I try to keep myself happy by saying stuff like ""If I make it through, this would make one hell of a movie/book/autobiography"" and ""one more year of school and you can move to California and it will all go away"", but deep down I really wonder if I can do it. My sisters have also taken this really hard with one on pills after being diagnosed with depression, and the other sad all the time. Honestly, my life right now feels like every Eminem song and it is hard to cope with.

I know this has kind of turned into a rant/me venting, but over the hour it has taken me to write this, I feel I've calmed down significantly like some of the load is released, so thank you for reading. I would appreciate any advice or positive comments that are not hotlines or medical help (I already have that much covered by my counselor and therapist) because my mom has destroyed all of the friendships that I could really use right now to talk about all of this. Thanks!"
985ue3,2,2018-08-17,Should I ask for more tests?,riwalenn,Endo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Endo/comments/985ue3/should_i_ask_for_more_tests/,"Hello,

I went to a new ob/gyn recommended for endometriosis a few months ago. She completely acknowledged my pain and I start non stop birth control from then with an endovaginal echo to check it.

When I went back 3 months later for a new prescription, as she told me before, she was on holiday and her intern took care of me. Still, she talk about my situations to the intern and told her that they couldn't find anything on the echo and that the one I saw is very trustworthy.

I stay on non stop pills which is fine for me. (no more periods, no more pain, and even if every 2-3 months I have to let my periods because I start to have some blood that won't stop until actual periods, the pain is bearable).

My questions is : should I ask for other more invasive tests or should I just keep having echo every couple of years to check? If there is nothing visible, maybe mine is not too bad (just badly located so very painful).

The person who took care of the echo ask me where were my pain to check also there and she came to the result that my perinee muscle are very strong and that it could explain my pain. "
985x52,1,2018-08-17,My [21M] graduate girlfriend [22F] of 5 years has been feeling depressed lately as a result of job hunting and some other factors. How do I make her feel better?,FickleBunch,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/985x52/my_21m_graduate_girlfriend_22f_of_5_years_has/,"Hi everyone,

Thanks for viewing my post. With sky-high rent, poor graduate prospects and some medical issues (poorly back, feet and knees) my girlfriend has been miserable. She's spent the past few months job hunting with lots of interviews and no avail. She's a graduate looking for jobs in the biomedical science field, and while she's a smart, qualified person, she's had no positive results yet. This has been crushing for her, and it's to the point where each job rejection ends up in tears.

Another factor is the prospect of living together. We've been dating somewhat medium-distance for 5 years now, and each time we do research on the prospect of getting a flat together, it just seems less and less likely. We'd love to move out of our parents' places, but even if she does get a decent job, I'm still at University for at least for another two years and can't bring much money in.

I love the shit out of her, and things between us are great. I just don't know how to make her feel better. I'm currently doing a paid internship and saving the money before the next University term starts, and I have helped a bit with finding vacancies and completing applications, but I feel like I can't do much else. She's already taking steps towards treating herself better (better diet, exercise, stable sleep schedule).

It pains me so much to see her like this. If anyone has any suggestions on what I can do to be a better boyfriend at this time, please let me know. I love her so, so much, she's truly a great person and I hate to see her down.

TL;DR: Relationship is great but girlfriend is feeling depressed due to job hunting and lack of affordable flats. How can I be a good boyfriend and make her feel better?"
9866oy,18,2018-08-17,The Abundance Mentality if applied to work/jobs. Two examples that might help people understand our struggles with it.,nortonsky,ForeverAlone,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/9866oy/the_abundance_mentality_if_applied_to_workjobs/,"Sometimes people suggest we should have an 'abundance mentality'. This mentality is based on the belief that there are plenty of people out there, and so being rejected by one or more individuals isn't a big deal, since there are many others who would accept us.

I think that in order to *really* believe in such an 'abundance mentality', you need to base it on something. To have evidence of past successes. To show this, I made up two examples of two different people, one who has an easy time having that mentality (except for work/jobs instead of love), and one who doesn't.

Example 1

&gt; John is a computer programmer. Throughout school, he was always among the highest achieving students of his class, and was praised by his teachers. In college, his success continued, and the internships he took made his CV well above average. This, combined with how desirable his programming skills are to employers, landed him a great job straight out of college. In the last 10 years he's worked for several different companies. Though he loves his current job, he's not afraid of losing it, for he knows he could get a new one without much effort.

Example 2

&gt; Mike went to college and got a degree as well, but he's starting to question just how desirable it is to employers. He's been unemployed for 8 months now. Despite trying very hard and sending dozens and dozens of resumes, he is either ignored, or if he gets an interview, he never hears back from them. Mike doesn't know what is wrong with him. Granted, his degree might not be as desirable as John's, but he looks presentable, he's polite talking to people and he's honest and hard-working. People tell Mike all the time that he's going to find a job one day, but his confidence keeps getting lower. He also can't help but notice the people who tell him this all have jobs, and he feels like they don't understand what it's like.

&gt; Mike met John the other day, who he hadn't seen since college. He told him about his struggle to find employment, and John gave him some advice: to practice an 'abundance mentality'. To think that there are lots and lots of jobs out there, and for every company who rejects him, there's plenty more who'd love to have him on board.

&gt; Mike has a hard time adopting this mentality, though. For 8 months now he's tried his best and still didn't succeed. It's difficult for him to think there's lots of companies who'd love to have him, when he can't even find *one* that does. "

- Lived on campus at a university for 1 semester (couldn’t afford it) and racked up about 6k in debt
- Worked 2 jobs and blew all my money on food and random crap after I came back from school (I know I should’ve paid the semester I took with the money but I was more interested in going out all the time)
- Actually started caring about my money/saving once I began a professional development program that came with an internship
- Graduated from program and got offered a position at the company I interned for making close to 60k/year

I have minimal expenses:
$85/month - Phone
$30/week - Gasoline

60k is more money than I had ever anticipated and getting a $1600 check every 2 weeks is more money than I know what to do with. I am contributing 15% to my 401k and my company is matching a decent amount. I would give more info but I’m very new at this. 

More importantly, I’ve never had a credit card but I took out loans to go to school for a semester ($6k). My stupidity and lack of a larger income led me to ignore paying off my loans, I’m looking to figure out a way to get out of debt as well as get a new car since mine won’t get through this coming winter for sure. 

Not paying off my loans has dropped my credit score down to 408, and now that I have a steady income I would like to figure out a way to get my credit score back up as quickly as possible so I can get approved for a car loan. I think the school debt should be fairly easy to pay off, but I would also like to be saving close to $1000/paycheck so I can put a $10k down payment on a decent car.  Currently have $1600 (my first check) to my name.

Would anyone be kind enough to provide some financial advise? I want to be as efficient with this as possible.

**During the school year**

Weekdays:

1. Morning routine starts off with me sitting on the toilet on my phone watching random Instagrammers of men in their latter 20s enjoying the time of their lives, and I am sitting there wishing that was me.
2. My mom is lazy and never attempted to get a full time job ever since I started driving on my own. She is still a substitute teacher at the high schools. During my sophomore year of college, I was lucky she got called to work almost every day.  My mom would leave earlier than my dad.
3. My dad has a regular full time job. He'll leave the house at around like 8:15ish.
4. Go to school. Most of my classes were in the mornings and afternoons. I had one night class in my sophomore year. If I didn't have a morning class, I'd be home enjoying myself.
5. My mom would come home from work at at around 3:00 - 3:15ish.
6. I try to practice my instruments if I am not too tired. Sometimes, morning or afternoon.
7. Once 6:00 PM passes by, I assume my dad could be home anytime.
8. My dad goes in the basement to use the exercise machine.
9. He'll stay down their until it is around 11 PM and he showers.
10. When my parents are home, I usually sit on the computer all day. When my mom is around it is fine to watch TV with her on the same floor, because she doesn't mind the TV shows I watch, but my dad watches the news all the time and that's boring.
11. My dad does not have work every other Friday

Weekends:

1. Weekends are really awkward, because both parents are home.
2. Morning routine starts off with me sitting on the toilet on my phone watching random Instagrammers of men in their latter 20s enjoying the time of their lives, and I am sitting there wishing that was me.
3. I don't have many friends, so I barely go out, but I lie to my parents saying I am going out with a friend and I just go out alone, which is still fun. I go out for like 6 hours and take hike, eat, or whatever.
4. In the morning, I wake up late to pass the time of awkwardness. My dad is in the family room and I have to eat, but sometimes I wait for him to go somewhere else, sometimes I don't. If he's on that floor, I'll grab a bagel and when I finish, I go upstairs and sit on the computer all day.
5. I would practice my instruments sometimes and I always practice in the basement, but it's tough on weekends, because my dad loves being in the basement and I personally don't like being on the same floor as my parents.

**During the summer (talking about this summer mainly)**

Weekdays:

1. Morning routine starts off with me sitting on the toilet on my phone watching random Instagrammers of men in their latter 20s enjoying the time of their lives, and I am sitting there wishing that was me.
2. My mom is lazy and never attempted to get a full time job ever since I started driving on my own. She is still a substitute teacher at the high schools. She sits home all summer living a boring sedentary lifestyle.
3. Since my mom is not working during the summer, she goes to exercise class on most weekdays at 9:30 AM.
4. I have work at 12:00 PM, but I leave 10:30 AM to go out a bit. If my mother goes to her exercise class, then I just leave at 9:45 AM time. She will wonder why I am leaving the house so early, so I just wait for her to leave instead. 10:30 AM is more acceptable. My dad would think the same thing too. I hate when he's home every other Friday.
5. My dad has a regular full time job. He'll leave the house at around like 8:15ish.
6. Go to work at 12 PM and the job ends at 4 PM. I come home after work.
7. My mom would come home from work at at around 3:00 - 3:15ish.
8. I try to practice my instruments if I am not too tired. Sometimes, morning or afternoon.
9. Once 6:00 PM passes by, I assume my dad could be home anytime.

5. I would practice my instruments sometimes and I always practice in the basement, but it's tough on weekends, because my dad loves being in the basement and I personally don't like being on the same floor as my parents.
6. Summer weekends are more awkward. I can go outside and be on the trampoline or ride my bike to relieve the awkwardness, but my dad does tons of yard work and then it makes me look bad. Sometimes, my dad has barbeques with us too and it can be awkward spending time on the same floor as my parents all day.

My brother goes to college out of state, but when he comes home some weekends, things are not awkward. He had to go to school this summer for his unpaid internship. This summer was awkward. He is graduating September and  he is going to stay home for 6 more months. Things will be less awkward when he is home, but he wants to permanently move out in 6 months, and I will be proud he is moving out.

I hate my life. My parents are barely out of the house outside of work related things. My life is repetitive with me just sitting on the computer all day. It makes me ""look bad"" and makes me feel embarrassed that I sit on my computer all day. I feel like I sit here deteriorating day after day. I can't wait to graduate college in two more years to move the hell out."

3) Officially you're my boss (intern, PA, actor on your first project behind the camera, etc... )

4) We are related. Top choice is brother/sister but open to cousins, aunt/nephew, or even mother/son

5) I live out in some rural small town that could not handle the news you were visiting, much less sleeping with me

6) Some combination of the above. Most of these are not mutually exclusive, and some even work better together

As for kinks and limits, I'm pretty vanilla... specifically into agegaps, incest, cumplay, oral, teasing, body worship, and maybe anal or impreg... but let me know what you're into as long as it's consensual and no scat, gore, blood, bimbo, drug use, non-con, or BDSM as those are my hard limits.

Am I in the wrong if I move out against their wishes?,TraditionalCause50,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/987jfq/my_20f_parents_dont_want_me_to_live_in_college/,"So I'm going to be a third-year student. My parents are paying for my tuition and don't want me to live in college dorms. I completely see their POV because I'm actually a year behind for graduation, I failed one semester of college (I was not a partier or anything, mental health issues + pressure got to me) while I was living in the dorms. I understand their reservations but I think I've proven I'll be fine living on my own now. I got straight As when I went back to school and successfully completed an internship related to my field and a course at another college while I was gone. My mental health issues turned out to be because of a medication I was on and now that's settled down too.

I feel suffocated now though. I go to a school where 99% of people live on campus and so it makes planning for things much harder since events are planned at odd hours under the assumption that everyone is on campus. My social life has kind of gone to shit. I also feel that I've matured enough in my time off that a repeat of the previous situation would definitely not happen. I lived in the dorms my freshman year too and I was fine that year, so I really do think it was my mental health issues that brought me down. I am also able to cover all extra costs related to living on campus myself. I think that the independence would be good for me now that I've gotten older, and I feel I should experience living on my own again before I move out.

My parents are for some reason convinced that I shouldn't live back on campus. I don't even think they fully believe that I would fail again or anything, but instead it seems like they're lowkey punishing me like this and just sticking to their stance because it seems like the right thing to do for some reason. Or maybe they don't really believe I had mental health issues? They still act like the situation was entirely something I should've been able to control, and while I do take blame for a good part of it, I still feel my health was the biggest factor. I don't know if I'm being unreasonable. I want to just move out but I don't know if that's too drastic of a move. Money isn't even that big of an issue for them but I feel like they're just sticking to this on principle.

tl;dr had a shitty semester mental health-wise, failed a semester, moved back home to get on my feet, now parents won't let me move back out"

He said that it was their Asia casting director [PoPing AuYeung](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0042690) who sent in online links to Henry Golding's hosting reels and that she said her interns worshipped him and pushed for Henry Golding at every opportunity.   Chu said he haven't met any of the interns, but the producers definitely agreed that Golding has that ""movie star quality"" and brought him in for an audition (while on his honeymoon) and instantly agreed to cast him.

Now, given the fact the producers supposedly wanted to make Rachel white and Kwan knew what disaster it was going to be for Asians, in terms of boycotting, it's not surprising Kwan, Chu and Wu played the game to placate the white producers by casting a hapa lead.

I have nothing against Golding, but it is indeed eye opening how the Haolewood game is played by the white producers and their obsequious lackeys in Asia who worship whites and hapas.  Indeed, if you look up Poping AuYeung's resume, she's only casted for WMAF for most of her career.   I've worked before in Asia and have met her and know this for a fact.

Since Henry Golding claims to be ""more Asian"" than Asian-Americans like us, then exactly who's money after they going after then; only Singapore and Asia?   Without saying, it's AF who don't care and has more options than AMs.   Therefore, I won't personally give the white producers my money but hope they can do better next time by creating full Asian-American stories about Asian-Americans before they get my disposable income dollars."

So, BF and I are both in our mid-twenties. We’re both in that awkward stage of our lives where we’re transitioning from being students to becoming proper adults. BF still has a couple of months to go until his thesis is complete, whereas I’ve already managed to find my first proper job (ie a job actually somewhat related to my degree).

BF and I are both involved in the local music industry but for different reasons. He’s in a band whereas I did my degree in that field. I was really successful while at university, but unfortunately, getting a job in the music industry after university would’ve included months of working for free (ie internships), but BF and I have rent and bills to pay (again, we’re becoming proper adults, haha). 

When BF and I met, they were just becoming popular in our city’s music scene. Since then, they’ve made a name for themselves locally and have grown a fan base in various cities. 

I am so proud of them. Incredibly proud of them, to the point that I’m documenting their major milestones to one day show our kids.  But I’m feeling a little left behind. I think know why; about a year into our relationship, I was asked to get involved with the band in a professional manner,  but it didn’t work out for several reasons. One of which was that despite being asked to be involved, I wasn’t being taken seriously. There were no hard feelings whatsoever and I willingly took a step back, giving advice only as I saw fit. 

Over the summer, BF’s band were given a prestigious regular show at our city’s international music festival. They’ve been involved in this festival for years, but this is the first time they have their own listing and are in the festival’s officia book, etc. 

This is the summer that coincides with everything in our lives changing; we’re both transitioning from being students, I had a hard time finding a job (like many of my peers, I know), and although I was offered a great position it’s not entirely related to my degree and what I’d hoped to be doing after university. I know that a job isn’t forever; this may give me the experience I need to find a job in the industry without having to prove myself through modern slavery (ie unpaid internships). BF’s career won’t be related to music (he won’t quit the band either), but I’m envious of the fact that he’s doing what I would love to be doing even if my involvement would be limited to behind the scenes. 

I don’t know if any of that made sense, and despite rationalising and talking myself through why I’m feeling this way, I can’t get rid of this sense of envy. Thankfully, BF hasn’t caught on and it hasn’t affected our relationship at all, but I’m worried that if I don’t process how I’m feeling that it may start to affect our relationship. 

Tl;dr: BF is experiencing success in my professional domain, and although I’m happy and proud of him, I’m feeling left behind and envious. I don’t know how to get rid of that envy before I affects our relationship. "

So today I rented out a sports car in LA and it was incredibly loud. When I was almost home, a cop pulled me over and wrote me a citation under my name and address for a modified exhaust. I told him that it's not my car and that I just rented it from an owner using the app Turo. He said he will still leave my name down, but he said to contact the owner immediately and Turo. I contacted the owner immediately and returned the car right away and he took my citation and said he will take care of it and the fees. So, I ended up talking to a traffic clerk at the court to see what my options were, because this is obviously not my fault. She was incredibly rude and said I have no choice, but to pay the fine and have it go on my record or go to court. I cannot go to court, because I am leaving LA in a week after an internship and I don't want to have something on my record which is not my fault. I called Turo and they asked me to submit photos of the citation. They said they are taking care of the situation and working with jurisdiction/law enforcement and should notify me within 24 hours. I was wondering if any of you have been in a similar situation? Also, how does Turo work with tickets and citations? If it's not my fault, will Turo basically hand the citation and liability over to the owner and have him take care of it? I don't want any courtesy notices sent to my house and having to pay for something that I'm not liable for. Please let me know if you know how Turo handles this. I am incredibly stressed out. Thank you!

988hu9,103,2018-08-17,You guys have no idea...,Maxog,antiMLM,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/988hu9/you_guys_have_no_idea/,"How far the spread of MLMs are in (sub)urban America but also how great the work you guys are doing here with exposing this pyramid schemes for what they are and how badly they ruin people's lives.

Let me explain my two brief experiences with MLMs:

The first true encounter I had with a MLM scheme was face to face, in college. A friend invited me to this thing at a nearby hotel, but didn't exactly tell me what it was. Whatever, I was bored and the only other option was doing homework, so I went with him not knowing what the hell I had gotten into. We walk into this hotel, it's relatively nice, a casino on the side, a glistening chandelier, the works. It seemed pretty upscale for myself and friends, wearing our usual college attire of pants and a t-shirt that probably have been worn longer than we'd like to admit. We eventually find the conference room, have a seat, and wait for the mystery to begin. A few ladies and gents walk in, all nicely dressed, suits, dresses, you know, up to the nines essentially, to present to us, a crowd of broke third year college students. They begin presenting their meticulous plan, and throughout the whole time I just kept asking one question to myself - What were they trying to sell me? I didn't have a clue of what MLMs were, or of this subreddit, or any awareness of pyramid-scheme get-rich-quick like things. So I did what any normal college student would do and during the break in this 2 hour long ""presentation"" and google-fu'd 'Amway'. Literally page, after page, after page of results of things like ""Amway scam"", ""Amway Cult"", etc. One star reviews, horror stories, the like (I recently googled it as I'm writing this, and am sad to say that the results have unfortunately changed in favor of positive/direct pages for Amway). This sent literal chills down my body, because for some reason, the whole presentation long just gave me this unsettling feeling - like something was off and not right. It was like I was being ""sold motivation"" for lack of a better way of describing it. I have never felt a feeling like what I felt that night, and the sheer amount of strange unsettling behavior of being lied to your face by other human beings, and by your friend for their own personal gains is something I never hope to feel again. Needless to say, I noped the fuck outta there and didn't look back - in hindsight I should've told my friend they were a scam too, but I was too shaken up to say anything at the time. [The university also caught wind to what was going on and banned ALL MLM schemes from campus shortly afterward.](https://i.imgur.com/Gfff7xr.png)



My second story comes from later on in my university years, shortly after I had gotten finished with an internship and I was working as a seasonal delivery boy for the **guys in brown**. This was moreso a passive interaction, rather than the upfront presentation that I had experienced before. So for those of you that don't know about how the **guys in brown** do their (winter) seasonal deliveries, they hire helpers to do all of the running back and forth from houses due to the high volume of packages. It was exhausting work, but it was fun and I was just in it for a quick buck and, what else was I doing with my time? (I think everyone should do it at least once, at least for the stories you hear while on the trucks with the guys in brown - *totally* worth it.) In between the stories, however, there was so much snek oil thrown onboard the trucks that now that I know I've delivered it, I feel sorry for the people that bought it. During peak season, we were hitting 300+ stops, meaning sometimes an upwards of 600+ packages. At least 100 of these were packages belonging to MLMs. Every. Single. Day (for at least a month). The area we delivered to was what shocked me the most, however: upper and middle-upper class neighborhoods. We're talking packages from Thirty-one, doTerra, herbalife, etc., etc. The list went on, and on, and on. I probably delivered packages for MLMs that I am not even aware of. And the worst part of all of this, is that I have to admit that the MLMs had the most eye-catching packaging compared to the other contents of the truck. This stuff was literally meant to catch your eye and sell the brand. The sheer grasp that MLM schemes have reached into our communities has simply gone too far - it's almost like a disease, you either say no and become immune to it, or you say yes and spread the disease more. That's why you guys are doing wonderful work here, keep it up and never give in to the huns."

My MacBook has some real good mileage on it but with me transitioning to a business school, everything here runs on Windows. My internship had computers that ran Windows, and Microsoft has done a damn good job of improving the software.

I played with a Surface Book 2 for a while and it seems a lot better for my needs: multitasking, a lot of reading (where tablet mode would come in handy when I'm on my couch), and Office programs. The only possible regret I have is that I am really deep into Apple's ecosystem... iPad (which I have been wanting to replace, so maybe I could kill 2 birds with 1 stone?), iPhone, watch, iMac, Apple TV, AirPods.  Apple hasn't really 'innovated' the MacBook besides the overpriced Touch Bar model and I want to try something new. I figured we could trade laptops.

Any of y'all come from deep Apple ties and switched to Surface (any product)? How was the transition?"

I'm hoping to transition into a full time position at the same company in about 10 weeks where I'll have benefits. The last two months were a bit financially stressful. I had to buy a car for my new job which depleted my savings. I also wasn't able to legally work for a good month and a half. I have racked:

$500 CC debt - No APR for the first year, I make minimum payments. I know better than to accumulate balance, but it's just been tight the past two months. I plan to clear the entire balance when I get my first paycheck next Friday.

$600 debt to family. This is not urgent, but I'd like to pay it in a month or two.

$800 debt to gf. I'd like to pay this asap.

No other debts or student loans.

I will be getting about $4000 before taxes next Friday, and I'll be able to take a breath and hopefully put things in order.

I am not concerned about the debt situation as I plan to pay them off very soon. But still any advice is appreciated. I am more concerned about not having any health insurance for the next two months.

Also I am driving a 2006 Hyundai with bare minimum insurance. I switched to a policy where I only got the liability insurance. My car is worth around $3500, and I did not think it is worth it to have other policies.

I am still kinda new to the states and all the grown up stuff. My goal with this post was to get some assurance on my plans and make sure that I am not doing something horribly wrong or missing something crucial."

So I’m 19 years old and about to start my second year of college and my finances are pretty terrible. Spent all my money in summer with gf and now have a little bit of money but also some credit card debt. The real bad part is that my car is in bad shape, inspection (Pennsylvania) is due in October and it’s likely gonna cost $1,200 at the least, most likely more. Some specifics:

-About $550 saved up in a checking and 2 savings accounts. Can also maybe dig up $200 in an old savings account from being a child. Also have those old paper savings bonds thing that I could probably cash in early for who knows how much money.

-$408 on CC card. $346 due on September 6th. I’ll have 1 more paycheck between now and then, the 2nd paycheck is the next day (the 7th)
Credit score 720

-Driving to school every day is 30 miles. It cost about $110 a month to get gas but will probably be higher in the winter. Absolutely need a car, no way to get to school otherwise.

-Current gross income is only like $400 a month but I’m planning on getting a new job at school (computer lab assistant) and hopefully that will give me more like $600 gross a month.

-Car is a 2005 Nissan Sentra. 143k Miles. Radio dead, brakes rotors possibly warped. AC leaking. Possible wheel hub replacement needed soon. Possibly new tires. Possibly exhaust leak. It’s not looking good and I’m guessing this will cost way more than the car is even worth.

- I do live with my parents and they pay for almost everything for me. Dad is paying student loans and books. Phone and insurance are covered by my dad too.

My question basically is, with almost no money saved up, is it smart to attempt to get a personal unsecured loan ($10,000
Max) through my current bank that I have a checking+savings account with, and find a new car. Ideally looking for around a 2010 car with low miles. I also don’t know if I would get approved for a loan with just my credit, and I’m not sure if my parents would co-sign.
But thinking about all this, I don’t know how I’m going to pay for this car inspection in 2 months.

Thank you for any help, I’ll try to answer any questions as fast as I can.

EDIT: Also planning on getting an internship next summer for my major (aerospace engineering), obviously that money would be helpful if I got a paid job but this is all just hopeful planning.

EDIT 2: Everyone says its a bad idea to get a loan so I will not being doing that. Thanks for everyone's replies, a loan always sounded like a good idea because I dont want to sink thousands more into this car but I guess I will try to keep it alive and passing inspection for another year at least."
989j4i,3,2018-08-18,AITA for being irked about this woman/project team where I work?,PiPstein,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/989j4i/aita_for_being_irked_about_this_womanproject_team/,"So where I currently work, a previous employee was leaving and I had just been hired, and so I took over a project he'd been working on with another department. It was basically almost entirely built already, but they were just doing some final testing on the system and I was around to help them tweak anything in the last stages.

First meeting with them when the previous employee was still there went great. Then my boss asked me to schedule another meeting on them just to follow up a few weeks after. However, all of their schedules were so busy - and my hours limited - that I could only find a free time slot about 3-4 weeks out. He said it was fine, as it wasn't my fault, and it was probably good to schedule it a bit farther out anyways so they'd have more time to test.

However, one of the women basically yelled at me over email for it being too far out (lots of all caps words). I apologized and said that I was not only new to scheduling using that calendar system, but was very new to the organization as well (I'm an intern), and so asked her to forgive me for the misstep. I also mentioned that we thought it'd be better to let them have more time to test, as some of the functions of the system take a few weeks to go through anyways.

She didn't ever reply, but one of the other women did and basically just ignored my apology and suggested a new time, which was fine. However, when we met the day she suggested, their team completely ignored me. They basically only talked to each other, and they waited until my boss came in to ask questions. He kept trying to direct them to me, as I was more familiar with the system, but they didn't stop. When he left the room, they wrapped up ASAP and told me I was fine to go.

I asked them to give me a final rundown of all the changes they wanted. The one woman who'd yelled at me over email said, ""Well, you wrote them all down, didn't you?"". I nodded, but told her that I wanted to be 100% certain just in case, as they'd ran through a lot of back and forth suggestions with each other. I went through what I'd wrote down while they'd just talked to each other and they agreed that those were the changes they wanted.

I sat down right after that and got the changes done within an hour, emailed them a list of the changes in full detail, and asked them to please let me know if I'd missed anything or if they wanted any further revisions, as I was happy to help. No reply.

My boss asks me a week later if they'd responded yet. I say no, he tells me to email them again. No reply again. Two weeks later. Have they answered yet? No? Send another, then.

I sent a last one and we waited another two weeks after that. No answer. Finally, my boss got fed up and emailed himself, asking if the testing was going okay. One of the women answered back immediately and gave him a short email about how they were still discussing the details in some conference and would get back to us in a few days.

No reply ever came. I checked the system's activity logs. They haven't accessed the system in months. They're basically not using it.

In a short employee performance review a few days ago (my boss is extending my internship into the Fall and he suggested they might permanently hire me after if the budget has room), he said that that was one area he wanted me to work on, as I hadn't been the best at ""encouraging user adoption"" in that scenario. But how am I supposed to encourage user adoption when they don't even use it and they won't even speak to me in meetings?

Also, the two employees that work in my same building involved have been cold towards me in other ways. At one point, some of their communications interns were going to make some videos but had limited equipment, and so I offered to let them use my studio mic, lighting kit, and camera whenever they wanted for the summer, as well as point them to some great free software they could use, as they'd asked IT about it and my boss knew I'd done that stuff before. No reply.

I'd sat next to one of them at a larger meeting, said hello, and asked her how she was doing. She was courteous, but quickly moved to another seat. 

I'm very new to the business world, so I'm not sure if this is normal behavior or not. AITA, or at least too sensitive? Or am I right in thinking that these people are being a little cold towards me? "

He said that it was their Asia casting director [PoPing AuYeung](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0042690) who sent in online links to Henry Golding's hosting reels and that she said her interns worshipped him and pushed for Henry Golding at every opportunity. Chu said he haven't met any of the interns, but the producers definitely agreed that Golding has that ""movie star quality"" and brought him in for an audition (while on his honeymoon) and instantly agreed to cast him.

Now, given the fact the producers supposedly wanted to make Rachel white and Kwan knew what disaster it was going to be for Asians, in terms of boycotting, it's not surprising Kwan, Chu and Wu played the game to placate the white producers by casting a hapa lead.

I have nothing against Golding, but it is indeed eye opening how the Haolewood game is played by the white producers and their obsequious lackeys in Asia who worship whites and hapas. Indeed, if you look up Poping AuYeung's resume, she's only casted for WMAF for most of her career. I've worked before in Asia and have met her and know this for a fact.

Since Henry Golding claims to be ""more Asian"" than Asian-Americans like us, then exactly who's money after they going after then; only Singapore and Asia? Without saying, it's AF who don't care and has more options than AMs. Therefore, I won't personally give the white producers my money but hope they can do better next time by creating full Asian-American stories about Asian-Americans before they get my disposable income dollars."

ME!",ACfireandiceDC,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/989mql/guinness_world_record_holder_for_biggest_number/,"Where do I start? Well, I have always been terrible in school. I have had failing grades, and this is going to sound like crazy pseudosciene, but I literally believe that there is a prophecy that says that I will not succeed in school.

When I see beautiful women, or successful men with them, I don't resent them but it makes me think less of myself. I checked out the incel forum hoping to find some kindred spirits, but I didn't like them, either, because they were extremely misogynistic, hateful, and toxic.

By some random miracle, I got accepted to a university a year ago (Fall 2017). Mind you, I am 23 and have been doing college every year since I graduated high school, but due to the idiotic general ed that I have had to take, I will be 26 IF I graduate on time. I failed one of my classes and next semester, I failed two of them (Calculus 2, and another one called MATLAB). My dad (who I do not live with b/c my parents are divorced) knows about this. However, I did re-take Calculus 2 over the Summer and failed it again there. My Dad is inching closer to the truth that I failed my Calculus 2 course and will take it again in Fall 2017. Now, he wants to talk with my Mom and I on Monday about whether or not he will let me continue at my university this Fall. And I'm fucking terrified. What am I going to do if I don't get in???

Oh, and I forgot to mention, I got fired from an awesome paid internship where I was making 3D drawings of aircraft landing gear, so there's that, too.

And, because of some dysphagia that my idiot doctors have done nothing about, I wasted about $8,000 and turned it into a $1,200 debt that I am trying to pay off, because I have spent all of it on fruit smoothies, which are easy for me to swallow.

I am a fucking LOSER. Hopefully, next semester (if my dad lets me stay at university), I can pull my grades back up. My parents recently bought a condo for me to live in and for the other people there to rent, but I deserve NONE of it. I have a beautiful room in my home where I currently live, but I have never been able to keep it clean. UGH. Hopefully, I'm able to turn my life around soon."

98a4x9,2,2018-08-18,What was it like growing up with parents on the spectrum (who had Aspergers)?,kermit54,aspergers,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/98a4x9/what_was_it_like_growing_up_with_parents_on_the/,"Neither of my parents have Aspergers. Both of them are self-proclaimed very successful businessmen/women. This isn't false, my dad is currently an executive vice president at his company. My mom quit when she had kids but was certainly on the trajectory for a job equally, or possibly more, prestigious than my father. My dad has gotten more promotions in his lifetime than I can even count. I'm sure hard work played a role in his success but nonetheless he's great at ""playing the game"" of social politics in the office.

Going to college into business wasn't really much of a choice in my family. it was just what you did. I didn't really argue with it much. Although tbh I very well may have decided business as my career path regardless. My favorite example of this is when in middle school I was kind of interested in cosmetology and got these responses from my family:

Mom: ""Good luck making money""

Grandpa: Oh no, you don't want those jobs, they're bad, or not bad but...

Brother: Well if you were a hair stylist you'd probably also be working at McDonald's flipping burgers

Dad (after I asked him if I could study cosmetology in college): No, go into something you're interested in.

Similarly my parents, brother, and probably sister (never heard her talk about it) openly call jobs that don't require college bad jobs (although this may be more of a sign of them being upper-class rather than neurotypical). My mom for some reason always pushes me possibly becoming a teacher (everybody else in my family pushes solely business but my mom pushes both business and education). I've alwas been confused by this for a lot of reasons I can go into if interested.

Following social norms were an ABSOLUTE MUST in my family. I was was forced to join Boy Scouts, signed up for multiple sports, etc.). I  was gifted a few Barbies as presents as a child but was not allowed to get American girl dolls, an easy bake oven, etc. (my sister was allowed those things). I also couldn't get anything pink for school despite it being my favorite color (I couldn't even have a pink notebook). I wasn't allowed to take sewing in high school despite constantly begging my mom to, although I kind of gave up on begging her after freshmen year. I was forced to take many business classes (although tbf they made my sister take some of them too, not just me and my brother).

Art was also NOT encouraged in my house in the least. I remember I told my mom when I was five or six I told my mom I wanted to be an artist and she said that wasn't a good career because they make little to no money and are known as ""starving artists."" That was kind of her response to me whenever I talked about wanting to become an artist was to call me a ""starving artist."" Similarly, fashion design was not supported at all by my mom, partially because of money and partially because ""it's a girl thing."" My sister got a sewing machine as a child but I never did. I remember my mom also really never did let me sew when I asked to.  In the long run this may have been good in the long-term though as I grew up to be a terrible artist so maybe it was good she never encouraged art at all.

One thing that did surprise me was my mom was supportive of me going into fashion merchandising and marketing for college. I dropped out after two trimesters of a year because of how bad my school's program for it was but she did have no problem with me going into that.

I was also pleasantly surprised how supportive she was of me trying to be a model because she wasn't at all when I was younger, also not viewing it as a good career path. I snooped into her e-mail one day and I think the reason she ended up being supportive of it was because as a child I was butt ugly and made fun of a lot for it. When I became attractive I suddenly became popular and my mom tried so hard as a child for me not to be a loner (social skills classes, psychologists, etc.). I never really cared much about having few friends when I was little but my mom definately did. It really was SUPER crazy how popular I became when people saw my modeling pictures (to give some background, I basically just agreed to do a shoot for fun with an amateur photographer, I then found out I was super photogenic and people couldn't stop talking about how impressed they were about it with me).

I think that's part of the reason why I keep trying to get signed to a modeling agency (I haven't applied in about a year but hope to maybe start applying again). It was something I was actually good at and made everybody happy with me, as well as accpeted. It's not a long-term career so I couldn't do it for the rest of my life and doesn't pay super well either. I'm currently deciding what to do in business, I've tried a few paths and none of them I've been good at yet. I REALLY struggled with an accounting class I took in college (not to mention it was SO boring) so I probably won't be doing that sector. Unless you're going into accounting, business classes are kind of pointless but degrees are necessary for many jobs except sales. I did an internship for sales and wasn't very good at it, I don't want to admit I'm bad at it though. At this point, I'm labeling my sales ability as ""not looking good but still not enough information to make a solid conclusion."" Social skills is really all that matters as far as business careers, you have to get past the interview and then ""play the game"" to get the promotions. I'm working on my social skills and will continue to but this really made me nervous:

My mom tells me my social skills have improved so much since I was little yet I've been told by many people just how terrible my social skills are (not to be mean but because they're my friends and want to help me, I've also been told it my employers and coworkers). So I'm worried because if I've improved so much and yet am still so bad, can I really get to the point where I'm competing with NTs (obviously I'm putting effort in else I wouldn't have improved a lot over the years).

Sorry, I want off on a bit of a tangent in that last paragraph but the rest of the paragraphs focus on my question and it is that what was it like being raised by Aspie parents and what were they're expectations? How did it differ from my NT parents?"

3) Officially you're my boss (intern, PA, actor on your first project behind the camera, etc... )

4) We are related. Top choice is brother/sister but open to cousins, aunt/nephew, or even mother/son

5) I live out in some rural small town that could not handle the news you were visiting, much less sleeping with me

6) Some combination of the above. Most of these are not mutually exclusive, and some even work better together

As for kinks and limits, I'm pretty vanilla... specifically into agegaps, incest, cumplay, oral, teasing, body worship, and maybe anal or impreg... but let me know what you're into as long as it's consensual and no scat, gore, blood, bimbo, drug use, non-con, or BDSM as those are my hard limits.

**Conservative** I am a small town midwestern girl, I've grown up in a well off republican family. The night Trump won we celebrated like it was the best night of our lives. I've lived my entire life in this rich conservative bubble. I went to a rich college and graduated, although continued to live a fairly sheltered life. Now that I'm graduated I'm traveling outside that bubble and I'm in for a reality check. (this one is open to interpretation and I'd like to discuss it more fully)

**Walk of Shame**  I'm about to start my sophomore year of college.  I moved into a big old house with 4 other girls in the student ghetto of our medium sized college town.  It's still the summer but most of us stayed to have a fun summer before school starts again in September.  You are our neighbour.  You live there with your wife and young daughter.  You're in your mid to late 30s, you've been a good neighbour and have never complained if we make too much noise.  We did host one party a few weeks back and it got noisy but you appreciated that my roommate stacey warned you about the noise beforehand and we chipped in and bought you and your wife a bottle of wine.  We've become friendly over the last little while and always wave when we see each other.  In addition to watching us sunbathe you also get excited for every Saturday and Sunday morning when at least one of us is returning from our night out usually looking a little worse for wear.  More often then not it's me doing the walk of shame.

**Festival**  We're at a summer music festival, (the type of music is negotiable) but what should be the case is that i'm a bit of a novice at festivals and i'm not a hardcore fan of any of the bands and I'm just here to have fun.  We both are going with a large group of friends and friends of friends.  I'm here with my boyfriend who is really into some of the more obscure and underground bands while everyone else is interested in the big acts.   I want you to play a bit of an alpha male who is part of the friend group who has his eyes set on me.  You get to show me the ropes of how partying at a festival works.

**Vacation** Rose is in her senior year of college, her parents said that they wouldn't pay for her to go on a spring break trip with her friends but they would pay if she went with them and her younger brother. She was so annoyed but reluctantly agreed as long as she got her own room and they left her alone for the most part. She just finished an internship as part of her degree with a law firm, it's her hope that upon graduation she'll end up with a job there as she completes her law degree. For now she's not going to worry about work and school she's in the caribbean and she's going to relax by the pool, read a book and get her tan on. Her younger brother and parents tried to convince her to go on a hike but she had no interest. While lounging by the pool she is approached by a much older man, it took her a couple seconds but she realizes that it's one of the senior partners at the law firm.

**Son's Friend** My son has just finished his first year of college. Things have been going well for him and he fits in a bit more at college then he did in high school. He was paired with you as a roommate and now you are both moving into a house together off campus with a few other friends. He seems to have a bit more confidence and has started working out and even has a girlfriend, all of this I put down to your influence. You are an attractive young black man from out of state, you're at school on a scholarship. Because you have moved so far from home you've spent a few school breaks at my house so i've gotten to know you. My marriage has not been going well and my sex life has dried up a bit so i'm a bit sexually frustrated. Lately I've been fantasizing about you, and I'm getting more and more curious about being with a black man.

**Hiking** An experienced hiker, grew up camping with her family and doing long treks. Now out of University for a few years has a boyfriend who she wants to share this interest with. He's not the most outdoorsy though. He won't be having a great time, but it will be a group hike so there might be some other men to catch her interest. (the guide, brother (who brought his new miserable wife, another hiker, a bushman?) all possibilities.

**Babysitter**  A classic that's always fun.  I'll play a young naive innocent babysitter (18+)  and you will play the father of the kids.  There are many options for this, we could do it that you're my neighbour down the street, I could be an ""au pair"", I could be asked to go on vacation with you or spend some time with your family at the cottage.  Let's talk about this one if it interests you.

Additionally, i don't really have a scene in mind but i'm open to some raceplay scenes so feel free to propose those or any other scenes that you think I may be interested in. Hope to see those nice envelopes soon!

Some other setting ideas that I enjoy include: - school ski trip - Olympic Village - Holiday Party - Tropical Vacation - Wedding (cheating) - Family - snow day - fat or old guy

98c4ma,6,2018-08-18,How to deal with bullies in a federal work environment?,exgiexpcv,bullying,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/98c4ma/how_to_deal_with_bullies_in_a_federal_work/,"We have not 1, but 2 bullies in our service who act in unison.  They both appear to take great pleasure in degrading and emotionally damaging our co-workers.  A couple weeks back between them they managed to break down 4 different people to tears.  In a single week.  We're mostly highly-educated professionals (I'm doing my best to be intentionally vague so as to avoid identifying my agency), but the toxicity of our workplace is bad enough that people are depressed,  losing sleep, crying at work, developing ulcers and other health problems, etc., and I know of 1 that has actively reported contemplating suicide.

The bullying is a daily affair.  They mess with people's lunches, throw away people's food, and have driven our interns to tears.  They have loud theatrical conversations outside people's offices for the purpose of insulting the people in those offices daily.  I am the only Veteran in our department, and they have repeatedly accused me in signed formal statements having perpetrated acts of violence, or having threatened them with violence.  They feed off and encourage each other in their behavior, and whenever confronted, back each other up on signed statements with lies printed on our agency letterhead, accusing their victims of wrong-doing, claiming that they themselves are the victims (one is gay, and in each complaint against them, claims that the complainant is bigoted against them because of this, which is untrue in every case I'm aware of personally).  

They both do about as little work as possible, yet collect some of the highest pay and benefit levels for their positions that are attainable in the federal system.

At least 4 members of our service have been the EEO.  We've gone to our supervisor (we've had 8 supervisors in 8 years, and we're about to get another -- each one states something along the lines of ""We need to document this before I can take action,"" and then it's rinse / repeat when the new supervisor come along).  A few of us have gone to HR.  We've reported the problem to the union.  We're encouraged to continue documenting the problems as they occur, but the acts of hostility are so frequent, that documenting them is taking us away from our actual jobs.

We've documented the details, the major interactions, so our supervisor knows what's going on, but when we go over the problems with our supervisor, they remind us that they can't discuss what steps are being taken.  But the behavior is only driven underground.  Before they go to mess with someone, now one of them walks the halls to see if there are witnesses nearby, and when it's clear, they begin.  It's always the victim's word against theirs, and as far as we can tell, our senior management aren't going to risk actually firing them because they've both made it clear that they'll sue, and management appears to regard the highly-trained professionals of our service as expendable.

We are regularly losing skilled, high-performing members of our service to bad behavior, and nothing is done to the malefactors.  We are convinced that this has gone on for so long, that someone must go.  

We've had several suicides at our location in recent years, and I am coming to believe that no action will be taken on this.  These people do not appear to feel that anything they do will result in them facing any serious loss, and my people are losing hope that the situation will ever improve.

I think about the long-term effects of this environment; our poor health and stress, of course, but also the degradation of the services we provide to the taxpayers.  We are supposed to confront and report waste, fraud, and abuse at every turn, but the toxicity of our work environment undermines everything we do.  I went to our in-house Employee Assistance Program (EAP) and spoke with a counselor, but the primary avenue of action that they suggested is that I go to HR and request a change of assignment.  So I would be leaving all the workplace friends I've had for the years I've been with the service because our management refuses to police bad behavior, seeming out of fear that they themselves might be sued.

Any suggestions?  The only thing I can think of at this point is the IG, but that's kind of a career-killer, whatever is said to the contrary.

as the title says, I'm a 21 year old who is about to go to a Computer Science major. My dad pays my rent and everything and he prohibits me from having an internship. He says (validly) that I should focus on finishing college. 

I want to achieve financial independence. I'm more than halfway through *Rich Dad, Poor Dad* and have yet to read the books in this subreddits sidebar, but I love the idea and would love it.

I minimize my expenses - I buy only the stuff I really need (clothes, food etc.) and the products that will improve my life (for example books or products to improve my social skills).

*What would be the best strategy for me during my computer science major (regarding money)?*

I could:

 - learn as much as possible (both in the area of Computer Science, sales, marketing and financial independence) and not focus on money (I'd like to work in cybersecurity, so learning the skills needed for that will take time for sure; and later on I'd like to freelance that, so hence sales and marketing and ultimately, investing)
 - try to build a passive revenue stream by becoming affiliate for example - still, I'd have to know the area I'm reviewing the products in (I'm thinking textbooks - since I'll be using a lot of those)
 - after playing around with investing and consistently being good, I could invest a small sum of money and focus on that
 - some other option I'm overlooking

I would like other (more wise) affluent people to advise me here.

Thanks in advance!"

&gt;I wanted to start by saying that this is an important movie for people. First one to start humanizing asians in north america, I say North America because I'm Canadian. I wanted to know more about the casting decisions. Henry you mentioned this movie allows you to own your Asian heritage. I get it i don't want to take away from that I grew up in a mixed heritage. But I do want to hear you and john's thoughts that there is discussion that the main male lead is not a complete representation of what Asian men look like. And how casting a lead with mixed Asian and western features might perpetuate stereotypes of how really Asian looking man might not be able to be leads. - Asian man (paraphrased, and respect to this asian man for asking this question)

That was the question. John M. Chu gives an answer. My biggest problem is Henry Golding who, from my perspective doesn't get it. He believes in color blind casting which will always benefit him because it leads to half white half Asian castings (not half black half Asians or half Latino half Asians). Because they'll stop being color blind at ""Asian"" and pick a mixed race only white Asian. This evident from his comments later on this interview.

https://youtu.be/IztdvRT52Oc?t=2073

&gt;For myself you're talking about my next roles. For me it's me about being an Asian lead in a particularly Asian movie I'm super proud of that. But my goal is the normalization of being a different face in Hollywood. and normalizing the fact that it's an Asian lead. It's not a particular role that's written for an Asian character. my next film is called a simple favor. I'm Blake Lively's husband Anna Kendricks love interest and my name is Shawn Townsend **room erupts in laughter*** It's not necessary to explain my ethnicity. We need to get normalized. The fact that we have all these beautiful Asian faces on screen. And not explain where they come from or what they're doing there. That's the level we want to. For me I just want to be a leading man and spread inspiration to people that think that they're not good enough that because they were born somewhere else they don't belong in the country that they are in now. I think I'm going to be trekking away at that but that doesn't mean I'm not going to be taking Asian roles. My third movie I'm playing a gay Asian. I'm super proud of that. Doesn't matter the sexuality or race. I just want to be a spokesperson or role model for people who felt they didn't have that choice. - Henry Golding (paraphrased)

&gt;*poster's note this laughter is bullshit btw

I've heard that Hapas can be Asians but Asians can't be Hapas. So as a full Asian I can't be Henry Golding by this logic (speaking very matter of factly). Good for Hapas but arguably bad to arguably good for Asians (depending on how East Asian the hapa looks. this'll be explained later).

And to add to all of this I found this on r/asiansubdebates

np.reddit.com/r/AsianSubDebates/comments/989l0c/cra_casting_controversy_explained_by_jon_m_chu/

&gt;He said that it was their Asia casting director PoPing AuYeung who sent in online links to Henry Golding's hosting reels and that she said her interns worshipped him and pushed for Henry Golding at every opportunity. Chu said he haven't met any of the interns, but the producers definitely agreed that Golding has that ""movie star quality"" and brought him in for an audition (while on his honeymoon) and instantly agreed to cast him.

&gt;I have nothing against Golding, but it is indeed eye opening how the Haolewood game is played by the white producers and their obsequious lackeys in Asia who worship whites and hapas. Indeed, if you look up Poping AuYeung's resume, she's only casted for WMAF for most of her career. I've worked before in Asia and have met her and know this for a fact

So basically if this is true this PoPing AuYeung, who looking at her movies doesn't have a great track record on imdb (she's cast for movies like ""the meg"" has a wmaf sex scene and white male savior theme, skiptrace which arbitrarily puts the white male lead with an asian girl for literally no reason, the forbidden kingdom another movie with a wmaf theme white male savior theme)

To round off I think I get the reason John Chu is more absorbing of Henry Golding's Hapa ethnicity as Asian is because he himself has a Hapa daughter. so basically any criticism of Golding's ethnicity can be taken as a doubt on his daughters Asian ethnicity. My whole thing is the Asian men you want to humanize most are the ones that were demonized the most. And that's Japanese men a.k.a. east Asian looking men."
98cw22,57,2018-08-18,"In a vulnerable and bad place, any advice would do.",PleaseNoOnii-Chan,malementalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/malementalhealth/comments/98cw22/in_a_vulnerable_and_bad_place_any_advice_would_do/,"A lot of this comes from not really understanding what the culprit(s) is/are for these feelings, but my best guess is to run it down to one of the following or collection of them in some shape or form.

* Giving up porn - After 5 or so years of PMO addiction and on and off P for a bit longer than that this was the year I decided to be committed to giving up porn because of the poor impact it's had on me. I ended up in a very toxic place in terms of my mindset, whereby I found myself lusting at a thought of a beautiful woman in a TV show, movie, video game and more repulsive, of people I knew. Right on verge of giving up on the addiction this soon gave rise to intrusive thoughts with POCD thoughts being the dominant ones . I'm 60+ days sober, and although I'm in a far better place when I started, I've been struggling with a lot of anxiety and depression as a result of these things. I could run it down to being withdrawal symptoms that will run their course whereby picking up healthier and more positive habits will help the process, but my concern has risen to a point whereby I suspect it could be more.
* Routine - It's a bit over 12 months now into my gap year and basically I ended up In a place with the same routine for everyday of every week of every month so far. It's consisted of sleeping pretty late into a day ( 6 AM to 12 PM) and waking up pretty late ( 2 PM - 12 AM). To expand a bit more, It would consist of me showering 3 teams a week at most, playing video games all through the night, browsing the internet with Reddit, YT and more recently Twitch in particular during the day and watching movies and TV with what time I could. Although this was an on and off habit that took place at the start, at the time I was in a good place and i felt like I was in a really healthy one too. I was excited to wake up every morning (whatever time would act as morning), I would enjoy the day and go back to bed to have a comfortable sleep. After maybe 5 or so months after this that energy started to fall away which could partly due to other factors that I'll mention from, but my best guess would be from the repetition and unhealthy routine. The effects got worse each month whereby, and now I'm at a point where I've been sleeping at anywhere from 8AM to 12PM and waking up anywhere from 6 : 30 - 8 PM, binging twitch and then returning back to sleep to ultimately rinse and repeat.
* Emotional Dependency and Environment? - I'm not really sure on what to call this one, but for a lack of better words, I'll associate It with my home environment and what I'd believe to be emotional dependency. To give further detail on this, It's worth noting that for reasons I don't understand, being around my family with my Mom in particular makes me irritable and stressed out a good part of the time. It wasn't until I took this gap year that I started to experience the full effect. I've been in school for the last 13 years and so I've always had an avenue to get away from whatever the stress could be for a good part of a day and It wasn't until I went off to boarding school for the last 2 years that I started feeling really good about the environment I was In. I was around friends 24/7, I always had activities I could engage with. On the occasions that I'd be back home, I would invite my friend over or visit him which would ultimately curb a lot of the stress.  All together, I had an escape from whatever stress I had when around family. As you can tell that changed a lot this past 12 months because I ended up finishing high school, taking a gap year while my friends weren't and so all these relationships became fairly difficult to maintain. With all my friends halfway across the world and no means of travel I had no recharge from my family stress and no avenues for continued social activity that might have left me fairly anxious and depressed (again, i don't really know If it's a culprit).
* Toxic thoughts and brain fog - This has been a more recent thing whereby I've been having a competition between two different mindsets with one being positive and the other being negative. I don't really consider myself a toxic person and always do my best to exercise a positive mindset and be a decent human being, but these negative thoughts (different from the intrusive thoughts) suddenly pop up trying to convince me of their validity despite me knowing how irrational they are (If that makes sense lol). In terms of brain fog, I've been having it ever since the intrusive thoughts showed up whereby the only effect was feeling like I had a foggy brain, but never to an extent where I had trouble concentrating and remembering things. Recently, this has been something that's having a great effect on me though. I can't remember certain words, events, I'm more forgetful, I appear to have short term memory and often fail to concentrate on things.
* Burnout and reduced enjoyment/interest in things - I'd guess this could be a symptom of routine or PMO withdrawal if not both, but around May I ended up in a place where I felt like I needed to stop watching TV, Movies and playing Video Games because the process of doing these things for however long I was doing them for everyday felt fairly repetitive. When the interest came back months later, I failed to feel excited in the ways I used to about these things that led to reduced enjoyment.
* Obsession about my future and the unknown - Basically, I've ended up being overly concerned about things I shouldn't be. It's things like moving to a new country, ensuring I'll get a job, how much money I'll make when I get a job, securing internships and enough savings to do the things I'd like, getting an apartment I'd like to live in, which grad school I'll go to, whether I have OCD, depression or any other mental disorder (I mention this because I've done online tests a great bit to understand where I am mentally even though I always score something that suggests that I don't have one.), etc. I'm only 19 yet I've found myself researching up these things a great bit.
* Validation of feelings - This is a pretty short one, but It ties into the idea that I'm concerned I might have some mental disorder and so I evaluate my feelings in a way to make me feel comfortable. What i mean by this is that If i smile or laugh, I feel assured that I don't have one, but If i don't i get concerned and hence the ritual of doing online tests.

I'll hopefully be seeing a professional next month, getting into journaling, fitness, dieting and meditation to name a few. I know there are some glaring issues of course (My routine and PMO for one) but I'd love to get anyone's take on this.

Edit: To everyone that's given advice, thanks. It's given me a lot to consider and evaluate and has lifted my spirits."

I was a finance major in College (small, Jesuit institution), which had a big focus on writing, so I’m confident in my essays. My LoRs are strong, and I’ve held extremely competitive/prestigious internships in college, and was also on many boards and SGA in college. GPA is 3.85. I now work at a hedge fund on Wall Street, which has made it difficult to study the way I would like (working 50-65 hour a week usually).

One of my top choices is Georgetown for a variety of reasons, but also because many of my contacts from college have relationships with Georgetown, which I think may help me at least a little.

Overall I want to go to a good school that will get me into BigLaw.  I’ve been out of school about 2 years and not an URM.

98dcxz,3,2018-08-18,Given low pay with promise of Training for my Internship - been given absolutely no training within the first 6 weeks of 13 total. Anything I can do?,PlasmaRL,LegalAdviceUK,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/98dcxz/given_low_pay_with_promise_of_training_for_my/,"I began an internship near the end of June this year, which will span a total of three months. It's with a Startup Software Company.

At the time I was told of my wages, I kindly asked if they were negotiable. With the offered pay, my only rent option (10 minute cycle away student accommodation) took the majority of my income. Parents can not help, and after multiple applications to the University, neither can they.

On this wage negotiation, the CEO responded with an email, which included the following:

""We would expect to invest more than 50% of the internship in training you. If you would like a higher compensation, then we would probably expect more from you, and would offer less or little training.""

In response to that, I was excited to be trained (no other internship had offered this), so I accepted the pay, making it very clear it was primarily because of the training mentioned in the emails.

\--

Now 6 weeks have passed in the role and no training has been offered:

The first week I was told to learn the code base we already had, so I did. I was then given a huge tutorial, from online (not them), which took me multiple days just to read by myself. I then spent a week producing code for their main product, using this tutorial. I was the only one working on this, and quickly moved to something else. I have not since used anything at all related to that tutorial - It seemed quite pointless to be honest. And not what I signed up for, so I requested I move onto something closer to my job title.

After this first 2 week period, I was tasked with validating and extending our backbone database. Our product could not work without it, and I cleaned it, made it 4+ times bigger, and more reliable.

The last 2 weeks I have been creating technical code used to clean up other incoming data, which will go straight to the front of their main marketable product. I'm directly contributing to the products they will be selling, and have been working in my own bubble over 95% of the time. The only questions I have asked are generic ""should I do this or this"" questions, i.e. product specification.

\--

At this point, my main priority is not to be trained - there are few people there that have enough experience to train me well. But I'm producing code they will make a lot of money off of, and I'm starting to feel frustrated at how little money I'm being paid for my contributions. (This probably sounds entitled though, I'm just looking to not be screwed over here or in the future).

There are other interns doing the same thing (writing useful code, albeit not as ""marketable"" as my work, and being paid very little), both this year and last year. I don't know if any of them were also promised training.

\--

Do I have any ground to demand either a higher pay or some sort of advanced training scheme? The main reason I'm frustrated is because they're putting a lot of time pressure on me producing very technical and ""productised"" code.

My main concern is that they'll either just pretend they trained me, or say ""other interns deal with it, you should too"".

At the very least, it would be useful to learn how to avoid this situation in the future? I assume it's fairly common.

Thank you in advance to anyone offering advice!"
98ds4y,2,2018-08-18,GUYS: Great first date.... then kind of ghosted?,vi0linm0nster,tinderstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/tinderstories/comments/98ds4y/guys_great_first_date_then_kind_of_ghosted/,"I went on a first date with this guy almost a month ago, I thought it ended up really well - we were together for almost 5 hours: got dinner, went to a couple of bars, and walked the pier. He initiated putting his hand behind me and then holding hands and a lot of small romantic gestures while we were walking along the pier. At the end of the night, I got pretty tired and didn't talk as much, but I would notice he kept gazing at me and his face was somewhat close, which made me just a bit uncomfortable actually, but also got me butterflies at the same time. Before I left I felt like I had to reciprocate something, so I gave him a small peck on the lip.

I waited for an entire morning the next day, but never got the after-date text from him, so my girl friends encouraged me to send the text and tell him I enjoyed the date (I also said to venmo charge me for the drinks he fronted). He responded and said yeah, we should hang out again sometime. His tone of voice was noticeable less enthusiastic as before, when he set up our first date and in some ways sound a bit uninterested. I also need to point out that he didn't respond to my text after that until TWO DAYS later (I really thought I got ghosted at that point). Fast forward to 2 weeks later, he asked me if I was free out of the blue (I mean if he didn't hit me up for 2 weeks I most likely gave up right), unfortunately, I was busy the night he wanted to hang out, so that was an opportunity missed. FYI, this guy is weird in that he doesn't try to text regularly just to talk, but only texts to set up a date (it happened before the first date too - he barely knew anything about me going into the first date), so this whole time in between trying to set up a date, we don't text at all. Not sure if he is just a really bad texter or he just doesn't care enough. In addition, he is super inactive on social media.. I texted him a couple days later after the night I was busy to see if he wants to hang out the next weekend, but he was flying out that weekend for a conference.

So to recap, I haven't gone on a second date with him yet, and it is approaching one month since our first date. Not sure if there is any hope at this point, but I find it odd that he's being cold yet he asked to hang out at that 2 week mark. Also not sure why he intiated all those romantic gestures on our first date if he isn't interested. He VERY VERY subtly suggested going to his apartment a couple of times through text and maybe once or twice in person, so could he possibly have just wanted sex from me? I'm not sure. I didn't give him sex on the first date, so could it be possible that he still has a sliver of hope for sex from me, hence hitting me up the second time? Or optimistically speaking, it just so happens that he's just really busy this summer and hasn't had the time this whole month for me. We're both in college and it is the summer months now, I would expect the summer to be more free than during the school year, but we come from different backgrounds and he has an internship somewhere (although I would think that an internship is less labor intensive than studying/school work).

I think he deleted Bumble or hasn't gone on Bumble in a couple of weeks because his location/distance hasn't changed for weeks (it would say he's at work at like 12am). So him hitting me up at that 2 week mark... am I the only girl he's currently somewhat seeing? I know that he and his ex broke up about 2-3 months ago.. (don't ask how I know but it took a bit of social media stalking). Are there still any chances of him hitting me up again - and possibly see each other more often when the school year starts? And most importantly, WHAT ARE HIS INTENTIONS???

Guys, what are men's chain of thought here? Any viable explanations to his actions? After our first date, I legitimately thought there could be a possibility of me and him, but I'm getting super mixed signals from this guy.."

http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/film-and-book-reviews/call-me-your-name-not-pedophilia-still-problematic

Quotes from article in bold, my comments in plain text.

Article starts. Two paragraphs of straightforward summary.

**Later in the film, Elio openly expresses his affection to Oliver. Oliver immediately tells Elio that they cannot act on this attraction, though in the movie he does not give an explicit reason why. Given that the movie takes place in the 1980s in Italy, the main fear is likely the stigma of homosexuality. The age consideration is likely an afterthought, particularly as the age of consent in Italy is 14. Despite Oliver’s initial hesitation, the two eventually initiate a sexual relationship. Elio’s parents seem to endorse this, and they approve for the two to go on a trip to Bergamo together.**

Why would the age consideration be an afterthought? I think Elio's age has at least something to do with it; note the hesitancy of Oliver at ""midnight.""

**Scenes quickly escalate to Elio and Oliver running drunk through the streets of Italy. Graduate student Oliver manages his alcohol tolerance well. Teenager Elio throws up, and Oliver subsequently kisses him—there is an implication that they then have sex. Questions of consent are raised in the viewer’s mind but not discussed in the film. Is it appropriate for a 24-year-old experienced in drinking to have sex with an inebriated and vomiting 17-year-old? Little is mentioned, and after the three-day fling, Oliver leaves and Elio returns home heartbroken. Elio’s father consoles him and speaks fondly of the experiences Elio has had with Oliver, suggesting he should savor the memories.**

Although Elio is (as someone on this sub put it once) ""totally wasted,"" I think it's pretty clear that Oliver's drunk too. They're in an established relationship. This isn't somebody sober putting the moves on a drunken acquaintance.

**Much of the movie is realistic. The adolescent process of developing romance and sexuality is complicated. For gay and bisexual young boys, it can be even more challenging. These kids are often afraid to talk to their parents or other confidants about their romantic and sexual interests for fear of rejection, and instead they go underground. In Elio’s case, he did not discuss his sexual exploration with anyone other than Oliver, who given his older age and experience, had significant power in the relationship and the potential to be exploitative.**

I'm still waiting for a good explanation of how Oliver has power over Elio. He's in Elio's country, in Elio's house, as a guest of Elio's family. And don't get me started on ""the potential"" to be exploitative. Potential of something is not the same as something existing. 

Paragraph with stats about modern gay and bi boys. Paragraph about Milo Yiannopoulos and his whole ""relationships between teenagers and older men can be beneficial"" controversy.

**This is a cognitive distortion. It’s true that these young gay people need support and affirmation. It should not be in the context of a “relationship” with an older man who can be exploitative.**

Yeah, CAN BE exploitative. Eyeroll.

**Elio’s father provides him with a strong message of affirmation at the end of the movie, accepting him for his homosexuality instead of shaming or chastising him. There is strong data that such messages of affirmation are associated with better mental health for LGBT kids.5 What was missing, however, was any concern about whether the relationship may have been dangerous. His father did not ask a single question about whether Elio felt in control in the relationship, if the power-dynamic was problematic, or if his sex was safe and consensual.**

This is maybe the one legitimate point the article has. If Oliver *had* somehow taken advantage of Elio, would the Perlmans know it? Lots of sexual predators can seem like nice people. *But*, he didn't.

Some stuff about the age of consent.

**In the case of Elio and Oliver, many viewers are likely uncomfortable because the poised and mature graduate student Oliver seems to have a strong power differential over Elio, who is younger and dependent on his parents. Elio’s immature limerence for the more confident and worldly Oliver may appear to come as a potential setup for manipulation.**

Can they *please* spell out exactly how it is that Oliver is supposed to have power over Elio?

**Although this film may empower gay adolescents to embrace their sexuality, the film is not without peril. Critiques have chastised this film as “pedophilic.” This film is not about pedophilia (sexual attraction to prepubescent individuals) or hebephilia (sexual attraction to peripubescent individuals). This film is about sexual predation.**

Oh, fuck you.

**Oliver looks much older than his reported age of 24 while Elio looks like a very young 17-year-old.**

So what? If Elio looked old for his age (I once knew a seventeen-year-old who could've passed for thirty) and Oliver looked young for his age, would that change what this writer sees as the power dynamics?

**The power disparity in the relationship is clear. Elio is fragile and sexually naive. Oliver is experienced and directive in the relationship.**

How is Elio fragile? He's sexually inexperienced, but there is not an inherent power dynamic problem in sexually experienced people having sex with people who have less experience.

Oliver's directive, huh? Oliver's the one who ""wants to be good."" Elio's the one who grabs Oliver's crotch (which, BTW, counts as sexual battery in a lot of jurisdictions). Oliver's the one who goes through their first time having sex asking Elio if everything is okay.

**One could argue that Oliver grooms Elio by moving into the household, spending time with him, endearing trust before advancing to a sexual relationship that is secretive. Elio’s parents are portrayed as supportive of the relationship.**

HE MOVED INTO HIS HOUSEHOLD, YOU GUYS. IT WAS CLEARLY AN ACT OF GROOMING AND NOT ABOUT, YOU KNOW, HIS INTERNSHIP. IT'S NOT LIKE HE WAS ALREADY SUPPOSED TO LIVE THERE BEFORE HE MET ELIO OR ANYTHING.

**In the end, Elio is heartbroken when he learns that Oliver has moved on to another relationship. In the scene in which Elio’s father speaks favorably about the connection, there is no discussion about whether Elio felt manipulated or exploited.**

Again, their one decent point.

**As is common with grooming, onlookers don’t identify or question the coercive nature of the relationship. Heralding such a film as a “masterpiece” is dangerous because it dismisses the exploitation in the relationship and is yet another example of the public’s reluctance to identify problematic sexual behavior. In light of the “Me Too Movement” and the endeavor to eradicate sexual abuse bred by an inappropriate power dynamic, this film promotes a dangerous message.**

UGH."

Tips on how to deal with this? I know this is not the r/depression subreddit but it's a dark place and I didn't feel like going there at the moment.

So I've been struggling with depression for 3 years now. Last year was okay but I was doing an extra master that turned out to not interest me at all and that combined with trying to ween myself of antidepressants made the studying not go very well.

However I got a paid internship which has resulted in me getting a job in October. And it doesn't matter if I have the extra master. My master of mathematics is enough, so the job is a certainty and the contract is signed.

Whenever I try to communicate my mental health issues at that studying is wearing me down, my mother just doesn't want to acknowledge what I'm saying and just basically dismisses everything I say. The closest she ever comes to acknowledging my mental health is to tell me that if I were in my right mind I would see that she's right. The fact that I really need these 2 months to get myself sorted out and finally after 3 years of struggling with depression and studying and all the anxiety that comes from that, I need a break. However my mother won't get off my case and refuses to acknowledge that I need some rest.

So I'm forced to do exams now in August but my student room will be gone in September and my apartment doesn't become accessible to me until October. How do I keep the peace even though I basically had to tell her that graduating definitely won't happen this year. She's never really shown me any kind of respect, it's as if she is unable to understand that I live in the same world as she does and that I make the decisions I do because I know how well I'm feeling and what I am capable of.

How do I keep the judgment at a minimum or how do I keep it from affecting me too severely?"

For the past six months, O’malley’s had become something of a lone source of comfort for Elise. The same dingy booth in the back corner awaited Elise with each passing week, and each time she found the seat more inviting, another drink more tempting. Though no matter how times she had drunk herself into a stupor, she never wished for anyone else’s company, only left to remain in her own sorrows.

Though sometimes, a certain woman would come to the forefront of her mind…

Elise worked as a secretary for a law firm. The pay had been enough to keep the threat of homelessness at bay, but that hardly mattered to Elise when she worked. No, her boss, the woman she daydreamed about as a schoolgirl might, occupied her thoughts. The girl could hardly function properly around the woman, her eyes averted to anywhere else in the room when they rarely spoke, her sentences stuttered and short when she spoke.

The woman exuded personal confidence and strength, traits Elise admired and so desperately wished she had. Struggling in the trials of the real world, the young redhead had been drawn to her like a moth to a flame. Her own lack of friends or self esteem for once did not matter when she caught her boss’s gaze. Elise’s fears and self doubts seemingly disappeared when she was around the woman. Her knees seemed to weaken, too.
Elise found herself daydreaming once more, dreaming of being led by the hand by her boss, of being taken care of, of serving… The creak of the door brought Elise back to the real world she so desperately disliked, and she noticed a familiar face…

( Hello! Thanks for reading all that. This is a story I’d like to craft about my character named Elise, a young, vulnerable, and sensitive girl not ready for the real world. She finds comfort and security in her boss, a rare moment in her stressful life. I can imagine this story going many ways, not set in stone. Does her boss manipulate and take advantage of her young intern? Or does she find love as well? Regardless, this should be a story of gentle domination, and care. This’ll incorporate elements of D / S and MD / LG. Sound like your cup of tea? Please. Send me a message and I’d love to try something out!)"

I was being bullied at work by someond who tangientally worked with me and has an office located not far at all from where I work. Past few month have been hell. To top it all of, a guy who also tangientally working with me, sexually harassed me. I complained to HR about the former, with a belief that reporting the sexual harassement would probably get me immediately fired. My suspiscions were not far off, because I ended becoming the center of the investigation and ended up loosing some secondary job duties. I am essentially being blamed for the bullying on paper. 

The victim blaming and experience was causing me so much stress that I ended up becoming pretty ill on various occassions. With waivering support from my supervisor, I realized I probably needed to leave. Well, I found a job that even paid more. Got offered the job, accepted, sent out two weeks notice. Then things started seeming off. It was taking a while to receive an official offer letter/contract. When the president finally did follow up, they asked whether I wanted to be full time or contract. They seemed upset that I said full time. They also implied they'd send me work before I start. The gut feeling led me to the internet. Usually, I read reviews about a company before accepting an offer. Like an idiot, I didn't this time, an it turns out, the president has been said to have regular temper tantrums and is described as a tyrannt. These reviews have been consistent and confirmed as ""helpful"" by at least 7 others, and I don't think it's a company of more than 15. I'm panicking. I can't go to a more toxic workplace. It just might break me.

What do I do??? I acted rash. I can see if my boss will allow me to rescind my offer. She has always, for the most part, recognized my contributions, but I'm afraid it won't be accepted. I feel like my resignation may have caused a rif. Plus the HR complaint don't help. I could see if the reviews are true, but then I will have to be looking for work while being in that environment. I'd have to give a resignation to that person, and would not reflect well on my resume. Please, any sound advice would help. My anxiety is over the roof and I can barely sleep.

98ffs6,2,2018-08-18,New Texas CSB program FAQ,jeffw16,UTAustinAdmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustinAdmissions/comments/98ffs6/new_texas_csb_program_faq/,"The Department of Computer Science and the Business Honors Program are jointly creating a new honors program for both computer science and business called CSB. Currently, the closest equivalent to CSB is perhaps the dual BHP/Turing partnership. But beginning with the Class of 2023, the BHP/Turing partnership will be replaced with CSB in an effort to more formally combine the two honors programs and make them more accessible to students interested in both computer science and business.

I am an incoming BHP/Turing student but I am also getting used to this change, so I hope I can help everyone as much as possible with crafting a strong CSB application.

As far as I understand at the moment, CSB students will not be part of Turing, but they will be part of BHP. They will take honors computer science classes, but they will not be Turing classes. Instead, they will be geared exclusively to CSB students.

The curriculum seems to be very similar to the current combination of Turing and BHP except with non-Turing CS Honors classes and more internship opportunities exclusively for CSB. I believe UT is trying its hardest to create a formidable competitor to similar programs offered at other universities, like UPenn's Fisher M&amp;T and Berkeley MET.

Also, as far as I know at the moment, the application seems to be the same as applying for BHP/Turing, so all students will still choose CS or business as their first choice major and the other as their second choice major, and foremost consideration will be given to the honors program corresponding to their first choice major. In the past, that meant if you applied 1st CS 2nd Business, then you'd be considered for Turing. Once you were deemed worthy for Turing, only then would BHP review your application. The opposite process would occur for 1st Business 2nd CS. However, I am not sure how it works anymore with the new CSB program coming into place. Either way, it seems like the CSB application will be comprised of the BHP application plus either the Turing application or some extra CS questions added in.

I'm applying to a couple schools (CSUF, CSULB...) for an MS in Computer Science/Engineering and I am writing my statement of purpose. Something that really rings true in me right now is that I had a rough time in my undergrad. I did my best in school, but thinking back I think I could have worked harder. I didn't work, I didn't do any internships. I never thought I was ready for an internship. No matter what people told me, I thought I would inconvenience people out there. I didn't really have a mentor to tell me what was wrong with my mentality. I see the flaws I had now and I regret it. I couldn't find work for a year after graduating. I study at home all the time to learn as much as I can.

Eventually, I concluded that this isn't how I like to learn. The way I'm studying isn't as effective. I like structure, I like to learn along side other people. Sure I could probably do a boot camp, but I actually have interests in possibly working with some professors for a research position or a lab position. I would like to really change how I had treated my life before. I never had hardships before. After struggling for a while... I definitely see how I took things for granted.

 I know my situation is my fault. Thanks for hearing me out. 

Should I write my Statement of Purpose in this point of view?

OR

Should I just explain my interests in the programs, etc. ?"

Multiple covers on Times magazine. A spate of chat show appearances. You're one of the most successful and well recognised businessmen in the country. And all that before you've turned 40. 

Yet you never forgot your roots. Coming from a poor single-parent family, you know it took a lot of graft, and even more luck, to get to where you are today. And you don't want to be one of those businessmen who pull up the ladder behind you. Instead, you've decided to run an outreach programme, allowing one lucky young man from a similar background to you to experience a few months alongside you. You'll allow them to experience the world of big business, giving them an internship in one of your companies, as well as personally giving them lessons on the dos and don'ts of the professional world. And as an added bonus, you'll let them live in your multi-million dollar mansion!

But regardless of whether you want to admit it or not, there's a deeper reasoning behind your decision. Years of toil on your businesses has resulted in you neglecting your social life. You haven't had a stable relationship with a woman in years, let alone brought any children into the world. And sitting at night in your empty mansion, you feel overwhelmingly alone. You could get almost any woman in the world, of course, but most of them are just after your money, not after you. What you want is protégé, a companion, someone who cares about *who* you are, not *what* you have. And that's the real reason behind this programme. 

I'm your average 18 year old guy. I play video games, I go out with my friends, I refuse to clean my room. When I left High School, I thought the world would open up for me. But after rejection after rejection, I could see my future closing up. When I applied to your programme, it was one last throw of the dice, one futile hope at a future beyond blue-collar boredom. And to my surprise, my amazement, I actually got in!

However, when you finally meet me, seeing my surprisingly big eyes, lithe body and firm ass, you start getting different ideas, taboo ideas, ideas which you desperately try to suppress but fail to. In this young man you don't see a man, you see a woman, you see a daughter, you see a lover. And using your influence, you're going to try you best to bring this woman out into the open. 

---

Hi there! As the prompt suggests, I'm looking for a feminisation prompt based around a CEO turning me into their slutty new daughter. I will play a young man (18+) who has won the opportunity to be your intern for the summer. You will play a CEO, either male or female, who takes me on as an intern, but increasingly views me as a substitute slutty daughter. 

I would like this prompt to focus on our thoughts, feeling and emotions. For me, I want to be torn between my male identity, and the desire to be a wanted, loved and desired daughter. For you, you will struggle between wanting to give this young man a constructive and educative summer, and wanting to cave into your more carnal desires by turning him into your new slutty daughter. Of course the sex will come, but I'd also like there to be lots of character development and sexual tension. 

My main kinks are romance, feminisation, incest, cumplay/bukkake/gokkun, D/s (with me as the s) outfits and lingerie, build-up, free use, taking orders, name calling and group sex. My limits are u18s, excessive pain, non-con and skat/watersports. 

I try to respond at least once per day, although sometimes real life will get in the way. I write in the first person present, and generally try to write detail, liking around 3 paragraphs per response (although of course that fluctuates). In your response, I'd like you to include a little bit about your character, your kinks, and how you imagine this RP developing. I usually leave prompts up a little while before replying, so don't feel the need to rush your response. I'll try and reply to everyone, but one line messages probably won't get a response."

(Don't bother lecturing me on not studying ahead of time unless it's really worth your time) I took the first free PowerPrep practice exam today, and I got **164Q / 144V**. It is probably worth mentioning that I finished all of the sections with about 10-15 minutes left.

My native language is ASL, and I feel like all the vocabulary is just obscure words. I probably did bad on the writing sections; I wasn't sure how to elaborate my answer for the analysis task, which was pretty short. My Issue essay was 456 words, and my Analysis essay was 305 words. For the analysis task, I felt like I knew what additional evidence was needed and how it would help strengthen/weaken the argument, but I couldn't write that much without feeling like I'm being redundant.

I plan to review what I got wrong, and use the Magoosh GRE vocab flashcards app to practice for the verbal section. I feel like for a lot of the 2-3 word choice questions I got one but not the other correct, which is probably why I got so many of the verbal questions wrong. On Sunday I'll take the other practice exam and see how I do, and whether my vocabulary has improved. For this practice exam, I'll make sure to use up all my time, reviewing the questions after I finish all of them.

Any advice, especially regarding the essay and verbal sections, would be greatly appreciated! I'm applying for a PhD in Computing and Information Sciences at a top 70 school in the USA. It is also worth mentioning that the rest of my application is relatively strong for an undergraduate student (3.33/4.0, good letter of recommendations, multiple ongoing part-time jobs, conference publications, 4 internships (2 research, 2 at huge corporations))."

I am still on the hunt to do a literate fandom romance rp. Below are a few plot ideas, but I'm open to any you may have! (Note: These are Canon x OC, with you playing the canon role)

1. New Royal Crush (M x F or M x M) Bowser x OC

*Bowser grew tired of chasing Princess Peach. He knew she didn't feel the same way he did. So he decided to pursue a new person...*

This can be kidnapping, or maybe Bowser shows a sweet side. Up to you! 

2. Not for Long (M x M) Wallace Wells x OC (Scott Pilgrim Rp)

*When Scott brings over his new friend from work, Wallace outs on his usual moves. His best friend telling him the cute boy is straight won't stop him...*

3. The Lab Intern (M x F or M x M) Professor Birch x OC (Pokemon)

*When Professor Birch was told he would get a new intern, he wasn't expecting someone so cute. As his feelings grow by the day, what will he do?*

4. SHE/HE'S MINE! (M x F or M x M) BTR guys x OC (Big Time Rush)

*After a new up and coming artist moves into the Palm Woods, the guys go crazy for them (except for Kendall). Who will this new artist choose?*

This is a love rivalry plot. 

5. New to the Force (M x M) The Ginyu Force x OC (Dragon Ball Z)

*After Guildo left, the Ginyu force hired a new member- but weren't expecting someone so adorable and begin fighting over him. What will he do?*

This is a love rivalry plot. 

6. Game on, dude! (M x F or M x M) Bastion, Chumley and Hassleberry x OC (Yugioh GX)

*After a new student moved to Duel Academy, the guys couldn't resist them. Who will the newbie go for?*

I will play pretty much all other characters in this, and it's a love rivalry. 

7. Colors (M x M) Beast Boy x OC (Teen Titans)

*Beast Boy never thought he would love again. Until a cute boy joined their team... Wait, did he like guys? How will he deal with his feelings as they grow stronger?*

8. Moving on (M x F or M x M) Tom x OC (Star vs the forces of evil

*After getting dumped by Star for Marco, Tom never thought he'd love again... Until someone new comes into his sights...*

If none of these strike your fancy, feel free to give me your ideas/fandoms! 

⭐⭐ Here are my rules:

1. Please be literate. No text talk or bad grammar (minus the occasional slip up of course).

2. I only rp in 3rd person. This is non-negotiable. Please be okay doing 3rd.

3. I ONLY PLAY UKE/SUB, NEVER DOM!!!! MY CHARACTERS ARE SUBS ONLY!!!! You have been warned!!!!

4. Be okay with OC x canon

5. Please be an active role player overall. We all have lives but please don't just disappear for days on end and never return.

6. If you are looking for all smut, you have come to the wrong place. I am fine with a build up to smut, but I want there to be a focus on romance and plot.

7. Please be respectful of me. I am a very friendly person but the quickest way to end an rp with me is to treat me badly. I am a human that deserves dignity like everyone else. Insult me once and it's over.

8. I'm sorry, but if your profile pic has a real person in it, I would ask that you change it before rping. It really just throws me off as weird as that sounds (anime/cartoon pics, scenery and anything else really are fine).

9. I usually do written bios, but if you HAVE to have pictures, I only do anime/cartoon refs and will only accept the same. NO REAL LIFE PICS PLEASE!!!

I am fine with people of all gender expressions, as long as you play M! My timezone is EST US time. All characters will be 18+. 

I think that's it? If interested, kik:

Hope to rp soon!

98he50,25,2018-08-18,LET'S TALK ABOUT THE CURRENT MANGA ARC WHOOOOOOOOOOOO,MetaDeviant189,BokuNoHeroAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/98he50/lets_talk_about_the_current_manga_arc/,"I FUCKING LOVE CLASS 1B AND WE FINALLY GET TO SEE ALL THEIR QUIRKS AND COSTUMES AND PERSONALITIES!

Alright, let's actually get to the point of this post. So, there's a few ways I think this arc can go. The way I see it, this might be the last training arc of the current school year. As far as I remember, Japanese school years end around April. We'll definitely have a final exam arc, but I think somewhere between this arc and that one we'll get a League of Villains attack and maybe another little growth spurt for Deku with another internship (not with the stakes of his last one but maybe facing down a smaller criminal organization). There might be a tiny Christmas arc as well as a Valentine's Day one. So, let's assume this is the last arc centered around *just* a training exercise, similar to the arc at the start of the series where Bakugo and Midoriya had their first real fight.

The first way this could go is that class 1B gets their asses handed to them by class 1A. So far, class 1B has been shown to be the ""weaker"" class, kind of the ""Mineta"" of UA. It's probably because there hasn't been a ton of focus on them, though. This arc might end with a ""We'll get you next time!"" moment for class 1B. I think this is a little more likely because Shinsou's here. It might be a chance for Horikoshi to set up a class 1B student being replaced by Shinsou.

Then again, on paper, it actually seems like class 1B is *better* than class 1A. Only one of them failed the final exams (Monoma) while none of them failed the provisional license exams. Now, I think this might be a set up to make them out to be the more ""conventional"" heroes. The ones who are good, but none are truly exceptional or special like Bakugo, Midoriya, or Todoroki. If this is the case, then they might leave this arc as most of the classes being equals while the three I mentioned (plus maybe Tokoyami {there might be a scene showing off whatever he's learned during his internship with Hawks}, Kirishima, Yaoyorozu, or Uraraka) are shown to be exceptional. Maybe with Kendou or Tetsutetsu being their equals. This would probably be the best way to demonstrate Shinsou's progress. Horikoshi would be able to set up a sort of scale. Shinsou would probably fall somewhere in the middle, showing talent, but he can't beat the top students because he just doesn't have the pure training or experience that they do.

Then, what I hope for, is the possibility class 1B *absolutely ruins class 1A.* The explanation could be that class 1B really took all of the losses (both literal like in the Sports Festival Arc to a perceived one, like their minimized presence in the Training Camp Arc) they suffered from class 1A to heart, and they worked their asses off to get the spotlight for once and to catch up to them. This would set up a sort of short-term goal for class 1A which might come into play during the final exams.

Now, this all kind of depends on what kind of exercise they'll be doing. If it's focused on rescue, with no winners or losers, then everything I've said is rendered null. I doubt it, though. I also doubt it will be an exercise where class 1A is pitted against class 1B purely. I also doubt it will be a free-for-all because the in-universe teachers and society of MHA have turned their focus to teamwork rather than individuality. If Horikoshi is going for a parallel, we might see an exercise similar to the one I mentioned at the start of this post, the one All Might presided over. It would probably be modified some way to keep it interesting, and they might have teams of four, but I think this type of exercise is the most likely. One that forces class 1A and 1B to work together against each other. Like, 2 1A students paired with 2 1B students against a similar team. This type of exercise would probably be best to show of class 1B's quirks because we can switch perspectives from 1A student from 1A student, the collective ""main character"" of the series. I don't think we've ever switched to the perspective to someone not directly related to class 1A. It would be jarring to switch from main boy Deku-kun to class 1B extra #3. It'd be much better to switch from Deku and Iida paired with 2 class 1B students to Bakugo and Yaoyorozu paired with 2 class 1B student, etcetera, etcetera. 

A far-fetched idea I had was that it's class 1A and 1B against Shinsou, which I think would be just... annoying. Either Horikoshi can render the theme of hard work instead of luck null by having Shinsou (who is not in the hero department meaning he doesn't have nearly as much training or experience as anyone in class 1A or 1B) win, or it's just obvious he's doomed from the start to lose. He could be paired with Aizawa and Blood King which would make it more interesting, but that doesn't fit Aizawa's character. He probably wants to use this exercise to show off his successor (we all know that's what he is).

Someone in the main thread linking the chapter suggested the school will be using Shinsou to weed out the traitor from somewhere in the hero department, which would be... eh? I think it would make for the least dramatic reveal possible if done wrong. Even if it was done right, I don't think it's the *most* interesting way to do it. Regardless, I think he'll definitely replace the traitor in the hero department and unveiling the traitor would probably be the *fastest track* to proving he's worthy to be in either 1A or 1B. 

Either way, I'm just happy we get to finally see class 1B. No matter how this arc turns out, we can all leave with the knowledge tHAT KOMORI (mushroom girl) IS T H I C C!"

When we met it was pretty obvious that we were attracted to each other physically and we had so much in common, but knowing she was in a relationship made acting on those feelings difficult. We ended up being partners in a competition and winning first place together and went back to celebrate at her and Joe's house. Joe did not care at all that we won and would just silently play video games all of the time. She wanted very badly to get out of that relationship, but she couldn't bring herself to hurt him. Even when he began verbally abusing her because she expressed the desire to leave, she did not want to hurt him and ended up dragging the breakup over 3+ months. This caused a lot of issues in the start of our relationship because, from my perspective, the feelings of an abusive ex were more important than my own feelings or how she felt about me. She felt trapped.

&amp;nbsp;

In any case, this eventually passed and we had a bit of a new problem. Our team from the competition wanted to live together, and our relationship had not yet started beyond knowing that we liked each other. We ended up saying its worth a shot, lets go for it, move in, and see if it works out. And it was great. We each had our own room so it did not feel too forced and we were fairly open about when we needed space and when we wanted to hang out. We were in different classes so there was no constant contact. We made it work. Both of us had been in pretty shitty breakups, and this relationship was like a breathe of fresh air for us.

&amp;nbsp;

Of course, as college students, its often difficult to talk about what happens once we graduate. We hadn't really, and I had just assumed that we would make it work again - whatever that meant. I ended up moving in with her in a big city where her parents had accommodations, because we had always lived together right? Why would we stop now? I made it a point to make sure this was okay (even my dad directly asked her mom to make sure this was okay, and she said it was at the time...). Neither of has had jobs yet, of course, and were just trying to figure out what was going to happen in life and how we would survive. I was graduated and found some contract work while she still had to finish a couple of summer courses for her degree. Eventually it starts to come out that maybe I shouldn't be living here. This originally came from her parents who did not want to have to lie to other family members about us living together in what is their apartment before we are married. This hurt a little, especially because I was told it was fine earlier, but I can understand the parents' point of view. My first reaction was to try to convince her to come find a new place with me where it would be more appropriate.

&amp;nbsp;

A little bit later it started to come out that she was second guessing us living together at all. I was crushed that she didn't want to after what he had been through, but again, I got over this and found my own place maybe 20 minutes away. She had no interest in leaving from her parent's place, and there was this sense that he had always lived together, which I can understand. I am still not sure how much of this was her parents or how much was how she actually felt. It has been a difficult thing to talk about. Anyway, once I was in my own place everything was great and seemed back to normal and we were close enough to visit whenever we wanted. My contracting work was simply not enough to sustain the city living so I was always looking for full-time work. Being fresh out of school meant I didn't have much of a chance to be selective. I ended up interviewing at a few places and finally was given an offer in a city about 1 hour south. I had to take it. At first, I was commuting by train (I didn't have a car) which took over 2 hours each way. I wanted so badly to make it work. I ended up lasting about 3 months of commuting before I had to make the decision for my own health to move closer to work. During this time, she got a full-time internship in a city about half-way between us. This seemed perfect as she had a car and my new place was only 30 minutes from her office. To add to this, we both essentially worked second jobs. I was still doing contract work (maybe an hour a night and a couple hours on the weekend) just in case my new job fell through and she had some other side projects to work on.

&amp;nbsp;

But because of traffic, that 30 minutes often becomes 45 minutes, especially on weekdays, with a full hour drive home. There basically was no way we could ever hangout on weekdays. Okay, that's not a huge deal, but it would cause us to feel this sense that we *need* to hang out on the weekends. And for me, that means a 2 hour commute each way. Again, no real issues at first, but especially when one of us wants to do something with friends on one weekend, and then a family event happens the next weekend, then that third weekend comes and I'm exhausted from work but you bet I make the commute out to see her because if I don't it would be another week before the chance came again. And of course, when we finally hang out, it's not always perfect. Anytime she would visit me, there would be some external anxiety about how far she is from home and that she had other obligations (like the side project) she had to be working on. Again I understood this, but it would happen just about every time she visited me, which meant that for us to have a good time I had to visit her.

&amp;nbsp;

I think the relevant points from above are:

1. She went from what was essentially an abusive first relationship where she lived with the guy to, once again, living with a new boyfriend. This means that she feels as though she missed out on being single during college.
2. We went through some very rough transitions together that often did involve a lot of emotions. Moving in together on the whim that it might work, graduating together, our first move outside of college together, then the first period of us living apart from each other, and then us both getting our first full-time jobs and finally being in a ""long-distance"" relationship while having our first full-time jobs
3. This combination of being long-distance and having new full-time jobs is a disaster for any budding relationship. It caused a sense of guilt/anxiety for both of us to want to hang out together, and often forcing meetups when it probably wasn't for the best.

&amp;nbsp;

Fast forward to a couple weeks ago, we have a particularly bad visit. It started with her visiting me and getting too anxious, so I end up riding back with her so that we could still hang out. We end up in a sort of stress fight about how I feel like she can never visit me without something going wrong. Not the worst fight we've had, but enough to be upsetting. She mentioned how she has been in a really weird space recently and that she was trying to work on it. I felt a similar way, I felt that we just really needed to take a step back and see what was going wrong.

&amp;nbsp;

I wrote a really long text the next morning about how I was proposing that we take a sort of ""soft break"" from each other. I realized that my own anxiety was causing me to feel overly attached and her anxiety was causing this sense of trapped guilt (do i go and feel anxious or stay and feel awful). I proposed that we step back from all of our feelings of obligations. We tended to try to say good morning and facetime at night everyday because we weren't able to hang out often. But this would, again, make us feel guilty if one of us was too tired to have a meaningful facetime call and because we are both anxious people it became difficult to communicate, in a happy way, that we didn't feel like talking that night. So we would (from both sides) essentially suck it up. My proposal was that we step back from these obligations. Assume that we take a few weeks off from hanging out and purposely avoid these forced situations of texting goodmorning and goodnight. I proposed that we would still text normally throughout the day if we wanted. She replied saying she is so thankful that I was able to step back and see what was happening, so grateful to have me, and that this was the best thing for us. (All of this was over text)

&amp;nbsp;

So now we go about a week without much contact. Almost anytime we talked it was me initiating, just saying something simple not really wanting to bother her or get into a full conversation. Maybe every other day I would say something. Finally, I start getting anxious about this whole situation because we had only talked about it over text and the way I left it was that we agreed to text normally (we normally would text throughout the day no matter what), and she wasn't texting me at all. So I finally asked her if we could talk. My plan was to just make sure we are on the same page - if what she wanted was to not talk at all for a while I would be okay with that, but we need to discuss it since we hadn't agreed on that. I came into this call very optimistically open-minded. I offered to step back even further, saying we don't need to talk at all for a little while and explaining the steps I have been working on to improve the situation (how I was working on myself). What she told me was a bit of a mixed message, that I took horribly. She kept saying that she wants her independence and that she doesn't know what she wants. She mentioned that she doesn't want to ""close any doors"", but that she wants her independence. I basically proposed that we can do a more ""hard break"" for a little bit, but all that I asked of her was that we do it with the intent to try again after a little while. That we do it optimistically with the desire/hope that it would work out. She could not respond to that. She ended up saying that she wants ""the option to date other people"" but that she doesn't have anyone in mind, and again, that she doesn't want to close any doors with me. That she loves me so much, more than anyone shes ever known. That she was really thinking about moving on, but when she finally sees my face again that she remembers how much she loves me. She doesn't know what to do. She wants to figure out who she is, work on herself. But through all of this somehow what I was proposing wasn't good enough. She needed this option to date other people, even if she didn't feel like acting on it.

&amp;nbsp;

I felt like she told me she didn't want to close any doors while slamming the door shut in my face.

&amp;nbsp;

I cried trying to explain how much I loved her, that I was more than willing to give her that independence. However much time she needed, however distant we needed to be. But if she wanted the option to date other people, that would be a break-up, rather than a break. We basically left it as let's just continue this break as we were doing it and we will check back in sometime later.

&amp;nbsp;

Fast forward to today and we still haven't really talked. A few days ago she asked me how my day was going and we talked for a couple minutes but that was it. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now, during this time apart I have been really working on myself. I have been meditating every day, getting back into exercise that I was ignoring, studying for interviews. I interviewed for a job 15 minutes away from her place and a couple days ago found out that I essentially got the job! It is basically my dream job and would solve our long distance issue while allowing me to quit my contracting job and have more time in general. She knows about this and is happy, but doesn't seem 1/10th as hopeful as I am that it would solve our issues. 

&amp;nbsp;

Basically I need advice. I have been on an emotional roller coaster. I am feeling so much and I have been having trouble focusing on anything. I don't really understand what she feels (and I don't think that she does either). This is making it incredibly difficult. I don't feel like I can talk to her about it. We are on this ""break"" and I don't want to push onto her that we need to talk until she is ready. But at the same time, last time she mentioned how when we stopped talking she felt like moving on, and when she saw my face she realized how much she loved me. Part of me thinks I can't just let this go, and that I need to push for answers and figure this out. The other part of me thinks I need to step even farther back, just say literally nothing until she comes to me wanting to talk.

&amp;nbsp;

So, any girls who have felt trapped in a need for their independence? What is the ideal answer to this situation? Is it a lost cause, and I need to break it off so that she can experience single-life and date other people? Is there some better way I can word what I have been proposing to give her that sense of independence without losing her? I feel like I can't just sit here on the sidelines silently hoping when I know there is a chance that she just comes out and says she can't do it anymore and that it's not worth trying for. It does not feel fair to me.

&amp;nbsp;

I feel so strongly that we can make this work. I will be talking to the CEO of my new job on Tuesday, and likely be able to move close to her within 1 month. Personally, between finally moving closer again and having had about a month to ourselves, I feel that we would be great again.

&amp;nbsp;

Any thoughts are appreciated! Apologies for the long story, I just need to talk this through with someone as it's hard to tell if I am crazy/over reacting and I still don't know what my next step should be. Of course I will focus on my new job and career, and I will be moving closer to her regardless. I just so badly want it to work, and maybe this is a fault of my own that I need to figure out.

98irzu,21,2018-08-19,Social policing and the thought process of WF/XF. Your experiences?,beingwoke,aznidentity,https://www.reddit.com/r/aznidentity/comments/98irzu/social_policing_and_the_thought_process_of_wfxf/,"Just want to clarify something for the sub based on my experiences, which some on the sub found surprising when I posted a comment before so I wanted us to have a dialogue.

Here in America, at the current stage we're at, from what I experienced, even attractive AM do not get much more WF/XF interested in them, the only WF/XF they mostly get are the ones who would be into asians regardless.

WF/XF socially police other WF/XF to not find AM attractive, even and especially the ones who objectively are, since 80+% of WF/XF are loyal to their own race. When WF/XF see an good-looking, tall handsome AM (or male of another non-white race), for most of them their initial thought is not, ""wow I find him so attractive I'd date him"". Their thought is, ""this guy represents a threat to the white race, we need to stereotype him and find him ugly/disgusting to mitigate the threat to other WF/XF, i'd never date an non-WM anyways"". That's why as an attractive AM, you face even more hate and stereotyping from WF/XF than a stereotypical AM, out of fear that ""asians are taking over"". As a 6' 4'' asian guy, I honestly get more disgusted looks and hate from WF/XF walking on the streets on NYC/Bay Area than my stereotypical friends do, and at work and school at my internships, I've also been the victim of more hate and stereotyping. I remember once at school I had to give a presentation, and my feedback was that I hadn't ""communicated"" my ideas well enough. Lol, I just hadn't prepared enough what I was going to say, had nothing to do with my ""communication skills"" but that's their default assumption, so the next presentation I prepared much more and made my thoughts crystal clear. Then, the feedback from some was that, although my communication was alright, I had overprepared and that I ""had no life"" and was working too hard. Couldn't be further from the truth lmao but the stereotypes are used to denigrate you. Whereas there was another more stereotypical asian in my group and they stayed pip quiet about him.

I swear from my experiences this is true. The only women who treat me decently well in America are AFs, and 1st gen AFs prob treat me the best, but 2nd gen AFs are pretty good too.

We can even see this playing out in Hollywood, when Ken Jeong is allowed to even have his own show and is more humanized than a guy like Godfrey Gao, who plays a gay wizard in city of bones.

Have any of you guys felt or experienced the same thing? I've been thinking about this for a while, has bothered me before haha, might be a bit obvious to some but I wanted to share my experiences with the community. I would be curious what about your experiences as well, and curious about what AF think too. I think more representation and media would def help a lot! but just wanted to let you guys know what I experienced and how it is now."

The real question is, why am I a secret?

1) You're just plain tired of your love life being front page news on the gossip websites

2) I am scandalously younger than you, maybe not even old enough to drive to see you

3) Officially you're my boss (intern, PA, actor on your first project behind the camera, etc... )

4) We are related. Top choice is brother/sister but open to cousins, aunt/nephew, or even mother/son

5) I live out in some rural small town that could not handle the news you were visiting, much less sleeping with me

6) Some combination of the above. Most of these are not mutually exclusive, and some even work better together

As for kinks and limits, I'm pretty vanilla... specifically into agegaps, incest, cumplay, oral, teasing, body worship, and maybe anal or impreg... but let me know what you're into as long as it's consensual and no scat, gore, blood, bimbo, drug use, non-con, or BDSM as those are my hard limits.

Multiple covers on Times magazine. A spate of chat show appearances. You're one of the most successful and well recognised businessmen in the country. And all that before you've turned 40. 

Yet you never forgot your roots. Coming from a poor single-parent family, you know it took a lot of graft, and even more luck, to get to where you are today. And you don't want to be one of those businessmen who pull up the ladder behind you. Instead, you've decided to run an outreach programme, allowing one lucky young man from a similar background to you to experience a few months alongside you. You'll allow them to experience the world of big business, giving them an internship in one of your companies, as well as personally giving them lessons on the dos and don'ts of the professional world. And as an added bonus, you'll let them live in your multi-million dollar mansion!

But regardless of whether you want to admit it or not, there's a deeper reasoning behind your decision. Years of toil on your businesses has resulted in you neglecting your social life. You haven't had a stable relationship with a woman in years, let alone brought any children into the world. And sitting at night in your empty mansion, you feel overwhelmingly alone. You could get almost any woman in the world, of course, but most of them are just after your money, not after you. What you want is protégé, a companion, someone who cares about *who* you are, not *what* you have. And that's the real reason behind this programme. 

I'm your average 18 year old guy. I play video games, I go out with my friends, I refuse to clean my room. When I left High School, I thought the world would open up for me. But after rejection after rejection, I could see my future closing up. When I applied to your programme, it was one last throw of the dice, one futile hope at a future beyond blue-collar boredom. And to my surprise, my amazement, I actually got in!

However, when you finally meet me, seeing my surprisingly big eyes, lithe body and firm ass, you start getting different ideas, taboo ideas, ideas which you desperately try to suppress but fail to. In this young man you don't see a man, you see a woman, you see a daughter, you see a lover. And using your influence, you're going to try you best to bring this woman out into the open.

Hi there! As the prompt suggests, I'm looking for a feminisation prompt based around a CEO turning me into their slutty new daughter. I will play a young man (18+) who has won the opportunity to be your intern for the summer. You will play a CEO, either male or female, who takes me on as an intern, but increasingly views me as a substitute slutty daughter. 

I would like this prompt to focus on our thoughts, feeling and emotions. For me, I want to be torn between my male identity, and the desire to be a wanted, loved and desired daughter. For you, you will struggle between wanting to give this young man a constructive and educative summer, and wanting to cave into your more carnal desires by turning him into your new slutty daughter. Of course the sex will come, but I'd also like there to be lots of character development and sexual tension. 

My main kinks are romance, feminisation, incest, cumplay/bukkake/gokkun, D/s (with me as the s) outfits and lingerie, build-up, free use, taking orders, name calling and group sex. My limits are u18s, excessive pain, non-con and skat/watersports. 

I try to respond at least once per day, although sometimes real life will get in the way. I write in the first person present, and generally try to write detail, liking around 3 paragraphs per response (although of course that fluctuates). In your response, I'd like you to include a little bit about your character, your kinks, and how you imagine this RP developing. I usually leave prompts up a little while before replying, so don't feel the need to rush your response. I'll try and reply to everyone, but one line messages probably won't get a response."

New Royal Crush (M x F or M x M) Bowser x OC
Bowser grew tired of chasing Princess Peach. He knew she didn't feel the same way he did. So he decided to pursue a new person...

This can be kidnapping, or maybe Bowser shows a sweet side. Up to you!

Not for Long (M x M) Wallace Wells x OC (Scott Pilgrim Rp)
When Scott brings over his new friend from work, Wallace outs on his usual moves. His best friend telling him the cute boy is straight won't stop him...

When Professor Birch was told he would get a new intern, he wasn't expecting someone so cute. As his feelings grow by the day, what will he do?

SHE/HE'S MINE! (M x F or M x M) BTR guys x OC (Big Time Rush)
After a new up and coming artist moves into the Palm Woods, the guys go crazy for them (except for Kendall). Who will this new artist choose?

This is a love rivalry plot.

New to the Force (M x M) The Ginyu Force x OC (Dragon Ball Z)

After getting dumped by Star for Marco, Tom never thought he'd love again... Until someone new comes into his sights...

If none of these strike your fancy, feel free to give me your ideas/fandoms!

⭐⭐ Here are my rules:

1. Please be literate. No text talk or bad grammar (minus the occasional slip up of course).

2. I only rp in 3rd person. This is non-negotiable. Please be okay doing 3rd.

3. I ONLY PLAY UKE/SUB, NEVER DOM!!!! MY CHARACTERS ARE SUBS ONLY!!!! You have been warned!!!!

4. Be okay with OC x canon

5. Please be an active role player overall. We all have lives but please don't just disappear for days on end and never return.

6. If you are looking for all smut, you have come to the wrong place. I am fine with a build up to smut, but I want there to be a focus on romance and plot.

7. Please be respectful of me. I am a very friendly person but the quickest way to end an rp with me is to treat me badly. I am a human that deserves dignity like everyone else. Insult me once and it's over.

8. I'm sorry, but if your profile pic has a real person in it, I would ask that you change it before rping. It really just throws me off as weird as that sounds (anime/cartoon pics, scenery and anything else really are fine).

9. I usually do written bios, but if you HAVE to have pictures, I only do anime/cartoon refs and will only accept the same. NO REAL LIFE PICS PLEASE!!!

I am fine with people of all gender expressions, as long as you play M! My timezone is EST US time. All characters will be 18+.

I think that's it? If interested, kik:

I'll be moving to the US (California) at the end of the month to start grad school and weighing out my options to get a credit card, mainly to start building credit. Here's my situation:

* I have a SSN from doing an internship in the US a couple of years back, during which I filed taxes.
* I also BofA checking account (I know, I know) with \~$1000 lying around in it, which I'm planning to keep around for now since I currently meet their criteria for no monthly fees. Planning to open a savings account with either Ally, Discover, or my local credit union.
* Even though I am a graduate student, I will **not** be receiving income from the university as I'll be paid under a fellowship from my home country. This income will be wired directly into my US bank account and I will not have to file taxes on it.
* I don't care about interest rates because I plan to pay the bill in full every month, on time, and not carry over any balance. I have responsible spending habits, own a couple of CCs and have a good credit score at home etc. 

Since I don't have a credit score, would my only option be to get a secured card? Or do you think I would have any luck with a student credit card such as the Discover It Student Cash Back? Would BofA consider approving me seeing as I have somewhat of a ""relationship"" with them?

Appreciate any advice I can get, thank you!"

The monotonous tone of the heart rate monitor still irks Eva to no end, despite the fact that she’d had years to get used to it. At this moment, however, it’s something she’s glad to hear, mainly because it reminds her that she is, indeed, alive and conscious. Her eyes aren't doing such a good job, providing her with blurred and unfocused vision, barely enough to make out the difference between the cream walls and white ceiling that she’s gazing up at from the cold, hard floor. Eva raises her hands up, rubbing them against her face… before promptly letting out a loud groan of annoyance. Her hands feel a bit warmer and stickier than usual. She’d just smeared blood across her face again.

The intern blinks a couple of times, bringing her vision into focus to confirm her theory. Her long and slender fingers, normally a pale caucasian colour, had been coated in copious amounts of crusting blood. “Not again…” she grumbles, pulling herself up into a sitting position as she does. Her scrubs are covered in red, incredibly uncomfortable on her skin. However, she’s pleased to know that she doesn’t feel any pain, nor any wounds. She looks to the patient on the bed next to her the one hooked up to the heart rate monitor. Well… it was beeping again, which meant she’d done her job properly. The unconscious man’s chest is exposed, with 6 little circles drawn around his chest areas. “No wounds left,” Eva mumbles to herself, nodding in approval. ""These... abilities really are something."" Her voice was rather smug in tone, accompanied by the ghost of a smirk playing on her lips. The man had been on the brink of death, shot point-blank in a gang fight, and yet now he has nothing to show for it except a little bit of blood where his wounds once were.

Eva gets fully to her feet, looking down at the patient with a sigh. Her face gives away no feelings of relief or care for him… merely satisfaction, her little scientific experiment had proven a success, even if she ends up bloodied for it in the end. She turns on her heel, making for the door… just before it flies open, and a doctor crashes straight into her. They both stagger for a second, before regaining their balance.

“Aggh- pfft, you may want watch where you’re going,” Eva tells him, letting out a huff before slipping around him, towards the door. The doctor recoils, seeing the little demon of an intern so suddenly. Eva’s reputation around the staff had made him hesitant enough around her \*without\* her suddenly appearing, coated in blood.

“D-Dubois?! What are you doing here, why are you all bloody?” the Doctor stammers, perplexed at the sight of the bloodied intern. She pays him no heed, giving a quick wave of farewell without even turning around. He could sort the release forms once the man regained consciousness, surely. Such unimportant matters had always been below her, but they were now more than ever. She had lives to save."
98l5dp,38,2018-08-19,"Just binged every episode until 4x09 and I have to say, season 4 is written by people who didn't watch the first three seasons",madali0,FearTheWalkingDead,https://www.reddit.com/r/FearTheWalkingDead/comments/98l5dp/just_binged_every_episode_until_4x09_and_i_have/,"Because I watched the full thing in just a couple of days, I don't necessarily have a rosy memory of the first three seasons, but they were entertaining enough. They were flawed, but it was reasonably consistent.  And the main thing was, you felt they were experimenting with the characters and story lines and it was getting better. Anyway, it wasn't a top tier show for season 1 to 3.

But then watching season 4 is just offensive. It's so fucking obvious that  the scriptwriters did not bother watching the first three seasons. They probably thought it didn't warrant their time. And I can almost imagine the whole behind-the-scene office politics bullshit. The previous showrunner wasn't doing that well (ratings were falling) and you had the new showrunner or showrunners telling their boss how the messed up the product was, how it was really ruined, how they really had to work really hard to fix all the previous guys fuckups, but don't you worry, we'll work overtime to fix their mistake. There is absolutely zero respect for the past three seasons. It almost seems that even if they like some parts of it, they will purposely shit on it or ignore it, to make sure they make themselves look better.

Keeping that in mind, you will soon see that the characters are based on executive summaries. Some intern wrote a few lines about each characters and handed over to the showrunners, because they didn't want to acknowledge the previous guys by even acting like they would want to even waste time watching their show.

Here is what I imagine the executive summary would look like:

1) Madison: Tough mom, will do anything for her kids, made tough decisions in the past

2) Nick: Teenage boy 

3) Alicia: Teenage girl

4) Strands: Black gay (Note: Very sassy!)

5) Luciana: Mexican

6) Daniel: Mexican (Question: Are two Mexicans necessary?)

And just now try to watch the episodes and see how obvious it is that they not only don't know ANYTHING about the characters, but they don't reference anything, and if they do, it seems almost wrong, like it was heard through six different people on the set until it reached the ears of the scriptwriters. 

For example, look at this dialogue which Luciana tells Nick (the ""her"" is Charlie in this context):

""I was just like her. At the colonia, I believed in what we were doing. I thought it was a good place to be, but it wasn't. I just couldn't see it. And you helped me. And we'll help her-- just not like this.""

Huh? The colonia wasn't a bad place, and it was definitely a good place to be. Sure, it was based on a lie by that doctor, but Luciana cared for her people. She is compared herself to Charlie being with the Vultures, while it is nothing at all alike, specially given that Luciana was like the number two person there! She was a fucking leader of the armed people!

It's really the same with every other character. No one ever references anything that happened in the previous season. The most they watched was the Dam episode, and I bet they watched that while barely paying attention.

I never really liked Madison, I thought she was an unlikable, selfish bitch that I watched her to die. But season 4 fucked me on that too. They killed her, sure, but they first changed her completely and then killed a person who wasn't anything like Madison at all. Madison in Season 4 wasn't even more of a saint and adjusted person than in episode 1 of season 1 where she was a school counselor and had never season a zombie in her life. 

Something else which I think is true. I think that Nick wasn't supposed to die,and when the actor resigned or was suddenly fired, they had to shoehorn that in, without really changing anything else in the script. Just re-imagine all the episodes we have seen up to episode 9 and just imagine Nick in them. It would work exactly the same way. Like fire camp scene in episode 8, everyone is so heartbroken and tore apart by Madison while no one even seems to remember that Nick died just a few days ago. They barely even reference him in any of the dialogues. Which makes Luciana's role even more bland to write, because they didn't have her to do anything aside from being Nick's girlfriend and now suddenly with Nick you have a character that doesn't work now because you have to delete half the dialogues with her that were already written and can't be bothered to rewrite them. 

Sorry about all this rambling block of text, but it's just hilarious how little respect the writers have for the past three episodes. It's a bit difficult to watch because I feel that if people who get paid for this shit don't bother to watch it, why am I?

Maybe it will get better in season 5, once they finish pouring shit on S01-03 to prove they are better."

If you don't know what an ARG is, it is a game with interaction that takes place between the audience or the solvers with the creators characters or the media he/she is using. Most ARGs have story that you guessed it, takes place in an alternate world than the one that you're living in. Most of these ARGs use many platforms such as twitter, youtube, tumblr, and sometimes discord to interact with the audience. The audience always has a part in the story and what is going to happen like a choose your own adventure but it takes place through the media that you have access to and some ARGs use the real world by lets say putting up QR codes somewhere or finding something that was put with coordinates on the ARG.

ARGs are really fun! The platform allows many creative writers to write out stories for the audience to unfold. Solving these or just interacting with the creator is really fun! Below I will show some of the examples of many popular Alternate Reality Games, but first I must say something. r/ARG is a community based around these amazing pieces of artworks, well for the most part. There definitely are problems with the community like some parts of it being toxic by doing game jacking and many other things we don't like. Participating in a story like the @TheSunVanished is not playing a part and rather game jacking the project. You need to know the difference between actually participating by interacting with the creator than making your own fake account pretending to be a part of it.

Some ARGs that were really popular...

Cicada 3301: From Wikipedia,""Cicada 3301 is a nickname given to an organization that on three occasions has 
posted a set of puzzles to possibly recruit codebreakers/linguists from the public."" To recruit people they made Alternate Reality Games with extremely difficult puzzles that started on 4chan by them posting an image saying that they were looking for highly intelligent individuals and that there was something hidden in the image. They were led down a difficult rabbit hole which lead to a website that gave out qr codes to the solvers. Once they got the qr code they were led down another rabbit hole and eventually if they made it to the end they would get recruited by the mysterious organization. This happened in 2012 and 2013. The 2014 puzzle is what we are stuck on or what we call liber primus which is unsolved.

@TheSunVanished: This is a game that takes place on the platform of twitter. The story talks about how the main character, TSV, has to survive in the world where ""the sun vanished"" and he has to survive against the aliens that are trying to kill everyone or gather intel on them. The creator of this Alternate Reality Game allows the solvers or audience to participate by putting out polls for what he should do. These can have an effect on what he does or what happens to him. There are also many other characters like Nat, Tucker, and Danyon who are also trying to survive this. Go give TSV a follow on his account which has around 400,000 followers!

Ilovebees: From Wikipedia, ""I Love Bees (also known as ilovebees or ILB for short) was an alternate reality game (ARG) that served as both a real-world experience and viral marketing campaign for the release of developer Bungie's 2004 video game Halo 2. The game was created and developed by 42 Entertainment. Many of the same personnel had previously created an ARG for the film A.I. titled The Beast. I Love Bees was commissioned by Microsoft, Halo 2's publisher."" The site was an Alternate Reality Game made to promote the new halo game that Microsoft was going to release. The solvers of this ARG noticed that the site was well, weird. At the end of this Alternate Reality Game the solvers were led to a place that was beta testing for the new halo game! Some of these ARGs can be really fun!

Red Triangle: This was an Alternate Reality Game made by an unknown person. This ARG took place on the deep web where solvers had to solve codes and ciphers in order to get to other deep web pages to progress the ARG. It started out when a user by the name of 0a0a put a series of hexadecimals on a tengri 137 solving livestream which led to a deep web page with hexadecimals. The solvers went through multiple onions... ever since it started in December the ARG has finished. If you would like to take a look at the Alternate Reality Game please go to Fright Knight's video on it. Here at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHyLLvgrW7g

Finally, if you would like to explore more Alternate Reality Games please go to r/ARG for new projects. You can also go to the discord they have to ask questions about Alternate Reality Games over here at http://discord.gg/6M9J2R9. I hope you all have fun there! Go deep down the rabbit hole! Solve as much as you would like!

I am still on the hunt to do a literate fandom romance rp. Below are a few plot ideas, but I'm open to any you may have! (Note: These are Canon x OC, with you playing the canon role)

New Royal Crush (M x F or M x M) Bowser x OC Bowser grew tired of chasing Princess Peach. He knew she didn't feel the same way he did. So he decided to pursue a new person...

This can be kidnapping, or maybe Bowser shows a sweet side. Up to you!

Not for Long (M x M) Wallace Wells x OC (Scott Pilgrim Rp) When Scott brings over his new friend from work, Wallace outs on his usual moves. His best friend telling him the cute boy is straight won't stop him...

The Lab Intern (M x F or M x M) Professor Birch x OC (Pokemon) When Professor Birch was told he would get a new intern, he wasn't expecting someone so cute. As his feelings grow by the day, what will he do?

SHE/HE'S MINE! (M x F or M x M) BTR guys x OC (Big Time Rush) After a new up and coming artist moves into the Palm Woods, the guys go crazy for them (except for Kendall). Who will this new artist choose?

This is a love rivalry plot.

New to the Force (M x M) The Ginyu Force x OC (Dragon Ball Z) After Guildo left, the Ginyu force hired a new member- but weren't expecting someone so adorable and begin fighting over him. What will he do?

This is a love rivalry plot.

Game on, dude! (M x F or M x M) Bastion, Chumley and Hassleberry x OC (Yugioh GX) After a new student moved to Duel Academy, the guys couldn't resist them. Who will the newbie go for?

I will play pretty much all other characters in this, and it's a love rivalry.

Colors (M x M) Beast Boy x OC (Teen Titans) Beast Boy never thought he would love again. Until a cute boy joined their team... Wait, did he like guys? How will he deal with his feelings as they grow stronger?

Moving on (M x F or M x M) Tom x OC (Star vs the forces of evil After getting dumped by Star for Marco, Tom never thought he'd love again... Until someone new comes into his sights...

If none of these strike your fancy, feel free to give me your ideas/fandoms!

⭐⭐ Here are my rules:

1. Please be literate. No text talk or bad grammar (minus the occasional slip up of course).

2. I only rp in 3rd person. This is non-negotiable. Please be okay doing 3rd.

3. I ONLY PLAY UKE/SUB, NEVER DOM!!!! MY CHARACTERS ARE SUBS ONLY!!!! You have been warned!!!!

4. Be okay with OC x canon

5. Please be an active role player overall. We all have lives but please don't just disappear for days on end and never return.

6. If you are looking for all smut, you have come to the wrong place. I am fine with a build up to smut, but I want there to be a focus on romance and plot.

7. Please be respectful of me. I am a very friendly person but the quickest way to end an rp with me is to treat me badly. I am a human that deserves dignity like everyone else. Insult me once and it's over.

8. I'm sorry, but if your profile pic has a real person in it, I would ask that you change it before rping. It really just throws me off as weird as that sounds (anime/cartoon pics, scenery and anything else really are fine).

9. I usually do written bios, but if you HAVE to have pictures, I only do anime/cartoon refs and will only accept the same. NO REAL LIFE PICS PLEASE!!!

I am fine with people of all gender expressions, as long as you play M! My timezone is EST US time. All characters will be 18+.

I think that's it? If interested, kik:

Hope to rp soon!

how do I get into the field?

I have had a short internship with a nuclear company over the  last summer where I have worked on an HMI system to control the nuclear  units, and I loved the kind of work I was doing.

I  have been applying for Control Engineering Jobs for over a month and I  haven't heard back from a single company :( I do not see any  Junior/Entry level positions at all and almost all of them require about  5 years of experience, I also noticed that they mainly look for  electrical engineers not computer.

How  hard do you guys think it will be for me to get into this field with  only 3 months of internship experience? I would appreciate any advice  especially from those in the field. Thank you !"

When she last priced it in 2015, it was worth $615. 

I’ve asked close family members what to do with it — keep it and let the value raise, or cash it in for savings. I keep getting conflicting answers. Hoping you all can help. 

Here is my current financial situation: the bulk of my paycheck going to bills (I live in a city with high cost of living for my job), with about $200 in regular savings, $300 in emergency savings (car troubles last year depleted this from $1,000 I had worked over a year to build up), and $6k~ in credit card debt (result of working an unpaid internship in college, necessary to graduate and get a job in my field, while still having to pay bills, as well as a move cross country for my current job). 

I’m 25 and starting to grasp the importance of financial responsibility, which is why I’ve been working hard to build a savings and then pay off my credit card debt. Slowly, but surely. I’m torn between using the gold to replenish my emergency savings so I can start putting more money towards my credit card payments, or to hold onto it. "

98n00g,1,2018-08-19,[M4A] From Trainee Personal Assistant to the Trophy Wife of a Billionaire [Feminisation] [Romance] [Incest?] [Long-term],clip-clop,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/98n00g/m4a_from_trainee_personal_assistant_to_the_trophy/,"A Fortune 500 Company. Multiple covers on Times magazine. A spate of chat show appearances. You're one of the most successful and well recognised businessmen in the country. And all that before you've turned 40. 

Yet you never forgot your roots. Coming from a poor single-parent family, you know it took a lot of graft, and even more luck, to get to where you are today. And you don't want to be one of those businessmen who pull up the ladder behind you. Instead, you've decided to run an outreach programme, allowing one lucky young man from a similar background to you to experience a few months alongside you. You'll allow them to experience the world of big business, giving them an internship in one of your companies, as well as personally giving them lessons on the dos and don'ts of the professional world. And as an added bonus, you'll let them live in your multi-million dollar mansion!

But regardless of whether you want to admit it or not, there's a deeper reasoning behind your decision. Years of toil on your businesses has resulted in you neglecting your social life. You haven't had a stable relationship with a woman in years, let alone brought any children into the world. And sitting at night in your empty mansion, you feel overwhelmingly alone. You could get almost any woman in the world, of course, but most of them are just after your money, not after you. What you want is protégé, a companion, someone who cares about *who* you are, not *what* you have. And that's the real reason behind this programme. 

I'm your average 18 year old guy. I play video games, I go out with my friends, I refuse to clean my room. When I left High School, I thought the world would open up for me. But after rejection after rejection, I could see my future closing up. When I applied to your programme, it was one last throw of the dice, one futile hope at a future beyond blue-collar boredom. And to my surprise, my amazement, I actually got in!

However, when you finally meet me, seeing my surprisingly big eyes, lithe body and firm ass, you start getting different ideas, taboo ideas, ideas which you desperately try to suppress but fail to. In this young man you don't see a man, you see a woman, you see a daughter, you see a lover. And using your influence, you're going to try you best to bring this woman out into the open. 

---

Hi there! As the prompt suggests, I'm looking for a feminisation prompt based around a CEO turning me into their slutty new daughter. I will play a young man (18+) who has won the opportunity to be your intern for the summer. You will play a CEO, either male or female, who takes me on as an intern, but increasingly views me as a substitute slutty daughter. 

I would like this prompt to focus on our thoughts, feeling and emotions. For me, I want to be torn between my male identity, and the desire to be a wanted, loved and desired daughter. For you, you will struggle between wanting to give this young man a constructive and educative summer, and wanting to cave into your more carnal desires by turning him into your new slutty daughter. Of course the sex will come, but I'd also like there to be lots of character development and sexual tension. 

My main kinks are romance, feminisation, incest, cumplay/bukkake/gokkun, D/s (with me as the s) outfits and lingerie, build-up, free use, taking orders, name calling and group sex. My limits are u18s, excessive pain, non-con and skat/watersports. 

I try to respond at least once per day, although sometimes real life will get in the way. I write in the first person present, and generally try to write detail, liking around 3 paragraphs per response (although of course that fluctuates). In your response, I'd like you to include a little bit about your character, your kinks, and how you imagine this RP developing. I usually leave prompts up a little while before replying, so don't feel the need to rush your response. I'll try and reply to everyone, but one line messages probably won't get a response.

N.B. A similar RP set on a farm is also available too. If you're more interested in that setting, then feel free to check my post history for it!"

Maybe I'd say a few words to you every now and then, have a pleasant conversation, maybe even get a picture at the end, but I mostly did it to help out the potential of working in movies later on in life.

As part of my compensation for the internship, I was invited to the movie premiere. I got myself a new suit, dressed up and walked along with everyone else that was involved in the movie, getting a taste for this life and wanting more.

It was at this premiere where I saw you again, like I usually did, except this time you were alone, and you looked stunning. You were seated at the bar, having a drink, and I figured now would probably be my last chance to say something. So, I downed the rest of my drink and walked over to you.

---

Hey! I'm Matthew, 21 years old and I'm looking for a girl to play as a celeb on this big movie premier. Ideally the two of us flirt for a little bit before sneaking off for some alone time. This can be as vanilla or as kinky as you desire, either way is perfectly fine with me.

Favorite Celebs: Emma Watson, Emma Roberts, Scarlett Johannson, Ariana Grande, Victoria Justice, Emily VanCamp, Jennifer Lawrence, Alexa Bliss, Becky Lynch, Dakota Kai, Nadine Velasquez

I hope to hear back from some of y'all, and if you want to play one of my previous prompts I'm always open to those as well!"
98npg6,1,2018-08-19,I miss my ex so badly,takemebackto-yourbed,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/98npg6/i_miss_my_ex_so_badly/,"I don’t even know where to begin. I really don’t. I haven’t told anyone this and I honestly hate myself for every event that transpired. 

And please, don’t judge me. I know I fucked up so badly in this story, I don’t need reminders. 

I’ll just start from the beginning. I was 15 when I met him, and he was 16. We met online and played video games together, for all hours of the day and night and we Skyped everyday. A few months later, right before I turned 16 and he turned 17, we started dating. We connected through literally everything, he introduced me to reddit. He is from a very wealthy family, I’m from a rather dirt poor family. Because of this, he was the popular, well liked nerd and I was the unpopular, hated nerd. He never treated me any differently despite knowing my family situations and I didn’t even know that he was from a wealthy family until I stalked his parents on Facebook. He lived 6 hours away from me and we lived in the same time zone, so it was okay for the most part.  We met for the first time almost 11 months later and it was wonderful. After that we saw each other every month or so. He graduated and moved in with me while I was just starting my senior year. We were inseparable. He was my best friend and my love all in one and I felt so lucky to have found someone like him. After some health complications (which he stayed with me and helped me through, 100%) we started university together. (This was 3 years after we had started dating, to give you all a timeline). We both moved away to go the uni, lived in the same dorm complex and saw each other every time we could. It was awful not being able to sleep next to him after I had gotten used to it for roughly 1.5 years, but we managed. He let me come over just to sleep in his bed on bad symptom days and he comforted me in the hospital and drove me to all my appointments. He bought me nice things, took care of me in all ways. He was almost perfect. Except....that he hit me on a few occasions and left marks. He hadn’t done it in years since we first started uni, so I didn’t really think anything of it. It didn’t bother me anymore and we had gotten past it and everything was completely smooth sailing. I swore this was going to be the person that I spent my life with. 

Two years later (almost 6 years into our relationship), I changed. Some switch in my head flipped and suddenly I was making really poor choices, I was doing horribly in my classes. I was skipping class, staying up all night to binge drink until I pass out. I was starving myself, self injuring on my legs. I became withdrawn and terrible. But he stuck through me being literally the worst girlfriend on the planet. He took me to all my psychiatry appointments, which were about two hours from our uni, back at my GP’s medical complex. It was hard but I was on several prescriptions to try to quell my symptoms. We could never find the right combination of medication and therapy at the beginning to stop my manic behaviour. I will keep reminding all of you that I was an absolute terror of a girlfriend. My mood shifts and behaviour were impossibly abhorrent. But still, he stuck by and always tried to help me. 

So where did it all go wrong? 

The beginning of my junior year is when my behaviour switched. At this time I met a new friend online. He listened to me, facetimed with me, talked to me all the time. His name was Callum and he was an absolute wonder to me. He lived in a different country, a different time zone and everything seemed impossible for us to be together but I thought he was so perfect that I had to be with him. Absolutely had to. I decided I was going to meet him, and I bought the tickets and booked a place and everything was all set. My boyfriend seemed fine with it, he even encouraged me to explore the world and maybe by escaping for a bit I would somehow start to feel better. While I was there I cheated on him with Callum. Multiple times. And when I got home from the trip I left my boyfriend for Callum, telling him that he was awful to me and never deserved me. I broke up with him through a text message, ending a now 6 year relationship in the worst way possible. He had just moved to a new city for a semester long internship so I essentially left him cold and alone hours and hours away from everyone. (The words of the last message he ever sent me before he blocked me on everything still haunt me “I’ll kindly die now”). He had still lived with me over breaks, so all of his belongings were still in our room. Roughly around the same time I got on the right combination of medication to help me, and it was after it had started taking effect then that I had realized I fucked up in quite a large way. I didn’t see my now ex boyfriend for a few months until he came back to get his belongings. I tried to reconcile with him but he was so heartbroken and upset and probably very angry at me that he didn’t want to be in my life anymore. We talked for a few hours in our old room and he listened to me cry. He comforted me and gave me support for one last time as I told him how badly I fucked up, how I wanted to drop out of uni and end my life, how I wanted him back. He told me, in the most kind way, that he wanted to see me live through it. That I was strong and I could do anything I set my mind to. He told me that he wanted to see me at graduation because he knew I was capable of pushing through just one more year. I wanted to hug him but he withdrew and quietly left down the stairs and to his car, where he left and never returned. And I stayed in my room, my heart shattered into a billion bits and pieces, without his warm arms to turn to and without his advice and his guidance. I was lost and alone (despite my relationship with Callum, but we will get to that in a bit). The only friends I had, friends from childhood years, quit speaking to me because of this. Those friends, whom I miss all the time, are on his side and refuse to speak to me. I was left walking into the next semester alone, friendless, and with a new boyfriend that lives so far away that I can’t even see him within reason. 

Callum is probably the worst type of person to be in a long distance relationship. It feels very one sided most of the time, with plans to talk or facetime or whatever being left upon me to ask if we could do something, because he always “forgets”. A relationship that once had us facetiming all the time and talking every night suddenly fizzled out to it being up to me to ask to do anything together, and then left upon his overall mood about doing the thing. We facetime less than once a month now, talk every few days for maybe an hour at a time. We text regularly, but he often gets busy with whatever he is doing (like playing a new video game) and forgets to message me back for hours at a time. And our time distance is pretty large, so those hours that he forgets to message me back, could mean that we had only texted for an hour overall throughout the day (like 10 or so messages). I don’t want to be with Callum anymore but I feel an obligation because I destroyed what I had previously just to go through this, so I might as well stick with it. It is completely irrational but I can’t help but feel that way. 

What no one knows is that I spend a lot of time alone now because I’m always crying. I miss my ex so badly that it actually makes me throw up thinking about what transpired. I cry daily, think about him constantly, even am plagued with dreams filled with our memories, what could have been, or some sort of weird quest that I am on trying to find him. I lied to myself saying that my ex boyfriend was an awful person and that because he had gotten busy and had less time to spend with me that it made him some sort of monster that caused my mental illness, but it was the furthest thing from the truth. I let another person into my life to try to make up for the attention I was lacking in my relationship and it ruined everything. I made irrational decisions that were based in the moment without thinking of the consequences they held in the future. Irrational and manic me believed that I could somehow have the best of both worlds. 

I know he doesn’t think about me, or if he does it’s thoughts filled with hate and anger and resentment. I don’t blame him for not wanting me in his life anymore. I don’t blame him for blocking me or not speaking to me anymore. What I did was vile and he did not deserve a single ounce of the shit that I gave him. 

It kills me to think that he’s going to die one day loving someone besides me, and I’ll die always loving him. Or that those children we always talked about raising or the life we always planned on having with a dog and driving Tesla autos will never happen. 

I want to redo that entire portion of my life. I want to be back with someone that wants me and desires me and protects me and takes care of my needs. 

The thought of having to spend the rest of my life without him is crushing me to bits. 

I’m so angry at myself for doing this. I hate who I am and who I’ve become in the process. 

At this point I know my suicide is inevitable. I feel it deep down. It is the ultimate punishment towards myself. My ex will never again be the same. He will never trust someone the same. He will always doubt himself. He will be forever less confident. Simply because I was a vile person and did not act or think clearly. 

Often I wish I had never met him to begin with. Although it pains me to think of a life where I had not known him, perhaps it would be in his best interest to never have crossed paths with me. Moreover I wish I had never come into contact with Callum. I do realise that it is not his fault for any of this but had I not met him, my life would absolutely be vastly different. 

I hope that some day someone treats me in similar way so that I can feel the pain he felt. 

It’s taken me hours to write this because it is so difficult to come out. I think I’ll finish here. I’m sorry to you all. I really am. I had to get this out so at least some people may know the truth. 

tl;dr : I left my wonderful long term relationship in a fit of mania and I deeply regret my decision. "

It started as just a regular day for him being the CEO of a multi trillion-dollar company. He drove his Lamborghini to his own building and had his daily ritual where he fired at least 4 women from his office for not giving him their golden green goodness, the women that would, which were very few and far, would be spared from being fired. All the top-level staff knew about his gastric endeavours but nothing was done to stop this, for they knew he was such an integral part of this company for if he were removed it would come crashing down on top of them, and jack played this into his advantage forcing the women’s liquids out of them every single day without a stop in sight. On this day though, a young beautiful blond-haired intern entered under his command and as soon as he saw her, he was in love. Soon after he invited her into his private soundproofed office, putting her under the impression that he wanted to welcome her into the office and that it was much appreciated that she was working with them. as soon as she entered jack was met with the most beautiful woman he had seen, flowing hair and a voice as sweet as a songbird, he quickly ushered her to sit down next to him on a couch to make the setting more casual, he started to explain the dynamic of the office and slowly introduced the idea of his need. He was cut off by her quietly saying that taking the gastric acid of women was a gross “fetish”. he was denied of what he needed most, by the person he most wanted it from, the first time he was said no to by the only person he couldn’t handle it from. Your mom is gay she said over and over, “how could this happen to one person”, she was kink shaming him and jack couldn’t take it. an expelliamus was fired and she revolted in fear, exposing her true nature, for what she was in actuality was an infidel trying to stop the crusades. He tore out his bastard sword and struck her down with a quick slash across her thin plate armour, it simply bouncing off but quickly striking again with a powerful stab, piercing straight through the thin plate covering her chest, blood poured out as she fell backwards. As the life was leaving her eyes he knelt down beside her, she was losing strength, he wished her a good travel into the afterlife and that Anubis would weigh her heart in her favour. Her life drained out of her face and it was over, the once perfect living woman was now lying on the floor after plotting to kill him, he felt justified of his actions until he noticed that in her hands was a note, on it wrote. “I love jack” the hand writing was alike to the writing of a 5-year-old or of a woman so it had to be her. This tore jack up, what could have happened to them If he took it slower, the life he could have built, the love they could have shared, if the woman were just smart enough to understand how to speak to him about this instead of the sounds of early English she was making. The blood pooled into his carpet reminding him of the atrocities he just committed. He collapses as his hands raise to his face, tears drop into his blood colored hands, streaming down them onto the floor where the body lays. He wishes he could undo all of it, he now understood where she was coming from, the shame she felt from loving a man with a problem like this, he would fix that, the button k appeared before him. He knew this was the only choice, his grief for the woman consumed him as he reached forward towards the letter, his fingers reaching ever further for it, he felt the smooth texture of the button as a gun appeared out of thin air rotation toward his face, this was it and he knew it, he knew he would go to hell and never see her again because he would go to hell while she went to Valhalla for fighting for what she believed in. the flash of the muzzle was the last thing he saw before his life was gone as well. His coworkers heard the gunshot ring from the cubicle and panicked some hitting the ground others running out the door, when it was apparent there were no more gunshots they approached where the gun was fired and found a man who committed suicide with the note in his handwriting reading “I love jack”"

Me and a school friend are actually abroad for our internship, in the same country, and organized weekend trips to visit the country together.

Context : She [23F] is a girl from my school I met early in the year through other friends. We didn't speak a lot except for a party later in the year in which we stayed together, had a good laugh, etc (I had a girlfriend at this time and nothing happened or was suggested beyond a simple friendship). We sometimes messaged each other since this day. Two weeks ago we went for a first trip of 4 days, and even if she said it didn't bother her if we slept in the same bed, we had two different beds and everything was fine and we spent a good time there.

This weekend I visited her city and I slept with her, in the same bed this time. And I told her I was single in the morning, because we spoke about my ex gf and it was very recent. The day was cool, and we finished the day by eating together and watching Netflix in her bed. Time to sleep, she kept telling me I occupied all the space in the bed (I really wasn't, not an inch of skin pass the half of the bed) so I just apologized and go further on my side. In the night, I was half asleep and moved a bit, and my arm ""felt"" on her hand, which was really close to my back, she awoke panicked and again I apologized. At 6AM she left the bed.. to go to sleep on the floor. I was really shocked, she just said that we kept waking up each other (the bed makes a ton of noise) and it was okay. Too tired, we continue to sleep and we exchange very few words before I leave, I did apologize several times and asked if I did anything wrong and she said that no and I didn't have to worry.

I feel really guilty and ashamed of this, I really didn't mean to make things awkward and I don't understand why she reacted like this. What should I tell her to avoid potential next meeting to be awkward ?

TL;DR: Slept with a friend and I don't know why it was very embarrassing and she left the bed to sleep on the floor in the night, feel guilty and ashamed."

I am still on the hunt to do a literate fandom romance rp. Below are a few plot ideas, but I'm open to any you may have! (Note: These are Canon x OC, with you playing the canon role)

New Royal Crush (M x F or M x M) 

*Bowser x OC Bowser grew tired of chasing Princess Peach. He knew she didn't feel the same way he did. So he decided to pursue a new person...*

This can be kidnapping, or maybe Bowser shows a sweet side. Up to you!

Not for Long (M x M) 

*Wallace Wells x OC (Scott Pilgrim Rp) When Scott brings over his new friend from work, Wallace outs on his usual moves. His best friend telling him the cute boy is straight won't stop him...*

The Lab Intern (M x F or M x M) Professor Birch x OC (Pokemon) 
*When Professor Birch was told he would get a new intern, he wasn't expecting someone so cute. As his feelings grow by the day, what will he do?*

SHE/HE'S MINE! (M x F or M x M) BTR guys x OC (Big Time Rush) 
*After a new up and coming artist moves into the Palm Woods, the guys go crazy for them (except for Kendall). Who will this new artist choose?*

This is a love rivalry plot.

New to the Force (M x M) The Ginyu Force x OC (Dragon Ball Z) 
*After Guildo left, the Ginyu force hired a new member- but weren't expecting someone so adorable and begin fighting over him. What will he do?*

This is a love rivalry plot.

Game on, dude! (M x F or M x M) Bastion, Chumley and Hassleberry x OC (Yugioh GX) *After a new student moved to Duel Academy, the guys couldn't resist them. Who will the newbie go for?*

I will play pretty much all other characters in this, and it's a love rivalry.

Colors (M x M) Beast Boy x OC (Teen Titans) 
*Beast Boy never thought he would love again. Until a cute boy joined their team... Wait, did he like guys? How will he deal with his feelings as they grow stronger?*

Moving on (M x F or M x M) Tom x OC (Star vs the forces of evil 
*After getting dumped by Star for Marco, Tom never thought he'd love again... Until someone new comes into his sights...*

If none of these strike your fancy, feel free to give me your ideas/fandoms! Other fandoms I enjoy but don't have a specific plot for: Adventure Time,  Avatar the last airbender, Disney, Inuyasha, Left 4 Dead, Legend of Korra, Total Drama

⭐⭐ Here are my rules:

1. Please be literate. No text talk or bad grammar (minus the occasional slip up of course).

2. I only rp in 3rd person. This is non-negotiable. Please be okay doing 3rd.

3. I ONLY PLAY UKE/SUB, NEVER DOM!!!! MY CHARACTERS ARE SUBS ONLY!!!! You have been warned!!!!

4. Be okay with OC x canon

5. Please be an active role player overall. We all have lives but please don't just disappear for days on end and never return.

6. If you are looking for all smut, you have come to the wrong place. I am fine with a build up to smut, but I want there to be a focus on romance and plot.

7. Please be respectful of me. I am a very friendly person but the quickest way to end an rp with me is to treat me badly. I am a human that deserves dignity like everyone else. Insult me once and it's over.

8. I'm sorry, but if your profile pic has a real person in it, I would ask that you change it before rping. It really just throws me off as weird as that sounds (anime/cartoon pics, scenery and anything else really are fine).

9. I usually do written bios, but if you HAVE to have pictures, I only do anime/cartoon refs and will only accept the same. NO REAL LIFE PICS PLEASE!!!

I am fine with people of all gender expressions, as long as you play M! My timezone is EST US time. All characters will be 18+.

I think that's it? If interested, kik:

Hope to rp soon!

98pvpj,1,2018-08-19,Advice on Buying MacBook Pro,IdleProgrammer,mac,https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/98pvpj/advice_on_buying_macbook_pro/,"Hello guys,

I needed some advice on buying a MacBook Pro. 

I have never owned a Mac computer but decided to make the switch after my Internship gave me a MacBook for my job. Programming on there was so easy with the more resourceful package maintainers and native environments that macOS offers. I also love the OS in general.

My questions are: 

Is the 13inch too small? I was sold on getting the 15 inch because it looked like a big size and dwarfed the 13 inch but not sure. The 13inch comes with 8GB RAM and that kinda makes me go towards the 15inch for the 16GB and CPU power. I am currently looking at the 2018 ones. 

Am I getting my moneys worth in those terms? Or will a 13inch with 8GB be a longterm investment? What did people who were in my position go for? (Programmers/Students)

Thanks and sorry if I was a bit vague."
98pxet,4,2018-08-19,I feel like I'm a narcissist because of how I'm treating a suicidal friend.,15yrThrowaway,teenagers,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/98pxet/i_feel_like_im_a_narcissist_because_of_how_im/,"Posted this to r/Advice but I lurk here on my actual account pretty often and thought I'd post here too. Love the sub and all the people in it. Thanks to whoever takes the time to read this.

Right now I'm just beginning my sophomore year and during the Summer I became friends with a girl I'll call Kale. Kale and I before Summer had talked and at one point in time she facetimed me out of the blue and said she felt like she was about to jump off a parking garage. This was the first time I had ever dealt with someone who was somewhat suicidal and over the next few months this escalated further.

Kale doesn't come from a very dark background and has a from what I know loving mother. She has two therapists, and has been depressed and suicidal before. She has a very loving group of friends to support her whenever she needs them. On a few occasions Kale has almost tried to make people notice her cuts, like wearing really short, shorts and while sitting made them visible. Then complaining that people noticed.

I've dealt with my own stuff like anyone has, but any thoughts I had of self harm or suicide stayed as thoughts and while I thought I might be equipped to help Kale during this time. I wasn't. Throughout Mid-May to this August I've been talking to her several times a week and for a month or two, daily. Since day one I told her anytime she needed me she can call, text, facetime, whatever she needs. Because I'll talk to her for however long it takes to calm down and go to bed. This offer was almost never taken, I would always receive calls after and once during her cuts.

The cuts continued and over time became more and more frequent once she moved to my school to be with my group of friends. I think a lot of it was anxiety, but I wouldn't be asking for advice if I knew what to make of any of this. Every day or whenever called, I would listen, talk in general, and offer any advice. She refused to get anyone else involved, keep that in mind. She didn't want to hurt anyone else or bring them into this, even her closer girl friends. I was from what I know the only person there.

The stress became insane to me, knowing that I was the only person she had and anytime something happened I felt the weight of it, I've struggled with weight my whole life and over those several months I gained \~30 pounds, and struggled with my internship at a local paper. The gain in weight made me extremely sad and borderline depressed after all the work I lost. But I felt that even if I was hurting at least Kale had someone.

Generally Kale can be a somewhat annoying person in a group of people constantly commentating on everything and trying to relate to stuff. And since she was so depressed I invited her to hangout with my group of friends, which also consisted of a few of hers, so that she would feel uplifted. This was also at the expense of me, her presence caused stress and anxiety seeing her act so normal but so terribly once we were one on one. It just got to me.

I consider myself pretty empathetic toward people and I understood how she felt, but she made me feel weird, calling me a her 'Favorite therapist' and stuff which was a joke but made me uncomfortable. Around Mid-July it began to be too much, the near daily self loathing, and depressed nature of her made me depressed and I lost a lot of care for my own well being which I'm still struggling to understand why. Her problems make me feel like I can't be sad or anxious about my weight gain, or how I can't be stressed about this responsibility I'm carrying.

Back to where Kale didn't want to talk to anyone about it I always said she can't beat this or feel fulfilled without others. Eventually the stress got to much and I talked about it to my closet friends about how her feelings and my own faults brought back suicidal thoughts and I stressed it wasn't because of her and I would never even come close to acting on them. But I shared what had been going on with her and why I had been acting weird when she was over. I felt like Kale was the only person I could talk to because a significant portion of my stress came from her, but I couldn't tell her that because it would make her worse.

I told them what she had done and said to me, which from what I remember wasn't explicitly confidential, but I assume was meant to be kept secret. I feel horrible for telling my best friends about it which consists of 5 other guys, and I've told my girl friends who are friends with her that I'm stressed to but I never told the girls the same details. Kale had a crush on me too I found out recently, and she is getting over it. But to me this just makes things even more complicated.

I feel trapped and I shouldn't share any of this with my other friends because I feel like I'm betraying Kales trust even if she didn't specifically say it was a secret. But if I don't share my pain I feel like I'll get worse. I've never had anything like this but my father is a narcissist and I really am scared of becoming like him and my actions in this feel like I'm taking attention away from her.

A few days ago Kale was admitted to a Psychiatric hospital and gets out tomorrow. She's aware I've told the guys but I don't know if she knows how much. I never said super specific details outside of what I've said in this post from what I remember. While I plan to continue helping her because its the right thing to do even if its at the expense of myself, I still don't feel like I can keep going. But if I stopped I would feel responsible for whatever comes after and worry my relationships with the rest of my friends would suffer. I've lost sleep, gained weight, and don't know if I'm making this all about me. But I feel like no matter what I do I'm in the wrong and I don't see an end to the thing with Kale.

Any advice, good or bad please give it. While my closer guy friends were very supportive and understanding I still want others opinions. I can't handle this on my own and the thought of me being a narcissist terrifies me, thanks."

I have decided to create one [resume for job searching](https://imgur.com/hfXsR5n) and a [general resume](https://imgur.com/S346HNT) that can be used to apply to hackathons, conferences, etc. The idea for the job search resume is that I will showcase my top two projects depending on the job requirements, and the general resume can be used to show everything I have worked on.

I'd like some thoughts on:

1. Do my descriptions give enough detail? Too much? I included a lot of information in few bullet points to cut down on space, but it might look too cluttered.
2.  Do I give enough detail for my job? I think not, but I recently started and honestly I feel a bit overwhelmed with all that I'm doing. Not sure how to word it all. 
3. Should I add a third project to my job search resume? (Probably the PHP one because it's the most different for me.)
4. Should I add the extracurricular org involvement to the general resume? Does it matter at all? I removed it to keep it to one page.
5. General tips! Be as harsh and honest as you wish. I'm here to learn."

Career wise I want to go into InfoSec, however things may change in 4 years, so I'm having a hard time deciding between these two programs!

Looking on the Sheridan website, ISS has an internship included with it, while CS has a co-op.  Upon looking at some past threads here in /r/sheridan though, some users have said that ISS *does* have a co-op as well.  

Am I mistaken in thinking that the ISS Program only has an internship, and not a co-op? 

If I went with taking Computer Science, I'd still be getting certs needed for InfoSec, as that'd be the kind of work I want to be doing upon graduation.

Both seem like excellent choices.  It's a hard decision for me!  I'd be coming back to school (graduated last year) so I want to choose wisely for this."

i have called the Lufthansa's customer relations and they have confirmed that i don't need a transit visa. 

I am taking contact with you regarding my denied boarding on the flight LH1331.

The flight LH1331 was scheduled to depart from Casablanca, Morocco on august 16th, 2018 at 1:30 am However, my boarding to the LH1331 has been denied by the check in agent at the Lufthansa check in desks in Casablanca’s Mohammed 5 international airport in Morocco and by that I have not arrived to Mexico city international airport (Benito Juarez INTL) on august 16th, 2018 at 18:30 Mexican time.
I have presented my passport and my flight ticket to the first Lufthansa’s check in agent who asked me what are the reasons for my flight to Mexico city and which company I’m willing to have my internship in then he turned to the lady in his left who was responsible for business class and gold members as the monitor above showed, however she decided that I need to stand by.

After minutes of me standing by, the Lufthansa’s check in agent she told me that there are high chances not to be on board of the LH1331 flight because I need a visa Schengen for my transit in Frankfurt international airport knowing that the transit is for 7 hours and 25 minutes without changing the Terminal 1 which according to the international standards is visa free, it applies also to the Frankfurt airport in which I will not receive my baggage neither I will change the terminal.
The Lufthansa’s check in agent asked me to give her any document that can justify my flight to Mexico City, from my part I have presented all the necessary documents that justified my flight to Mexico City which are:

       -      My Moroccan passport with Mexican visa in it.
- The invitation letter and the presentation letter from the organization that will sponsor my internship in Mexico City.

The agent took photos of the documents and sent them by WHATSAPP from her personal mobile to whom she said is the responsible for the flights in Lufthansa, during her conversation with the person on WHATSAPP she started asking me about which kind of training I’ll have, how much money I have with me and in which company I will intern, from my part I have responded to all her queries gently and kindly and to my surprise after that “INVESTIGATION”, she told me that I was not able to be on board of the LH1331 flight because “they didn’t like my profile”  while pointing to my physique and my face which I have found really offending and racist, she also told me word to word  “ you can go and sue the company if you want” otherwise I asked her if there’s a solution she responded “just forget about Lufthansa you will never be on board of its flights”.

The Lufthansa staff refused to give me any written explanation of why they were denying my boarding in the LH1331 flight, in contravention of my rights as a passenger.

 I was left with no justification to the organization sponsoring my internship which can result on delaying/cancelation of the internship and for consequence delaying my master’s degree graduation.

Also as a consequence to the random decision of the Lufthansa’s check in agent I have beared the costs of my booked hotel at Mexico city (IBIS MEXICO ALAMEDA) for the august 16th,2018 night, the costs of taxis and train back to Tangier, Morocco in order to come to my travel agency.  

I am very unhappy with the way this situation has been handled by Lufthansa’s staff.

I look forward to hearing from you and would welcome a response."

It's hard for me to know where to start, so I'll start from the beginning—but there are a few layers to this, so please bear with me.

I started dating my current boyfriend in late March. We were friends for a while, but there were factors that delayed us taking the next step—once it happened, though, it just all fell in place, and we just knew it was right. It was a risky decision for me to make at the time, primarily because of my upcoming graduation (in May) but more importantly, that I was set to work in Japan for a year after graduation. But more on that later.

But we decided that there were still a few months before my departure, and it didn't hurt to give it a try (after all, some relationships don't even make it to that point). Our relationship then developed extremely quickly. I've been with several guys before, but nothing was quite like being with him. We're not perfect, but we have similar values and great chemistry, and have always actively worked through the small things to only mature and better our relationship.

When we first started dating I'd noticed that he seemed close with his family, as he called them pretty often, and they knew about me. His parents expressed a lot of interest in me, as I'm his first girlfriend (and the first SO in the family, as his older sister's never dated anyone). BF ended up meeting my parents pretty early because of graduation, and this kind of jumpstarted his parents wanting to meet me, too. So when I drove him back from graduation, I stayed for a bit and they took me out to dinner, inviting me over to his house after to ~~chat~~ interrogate.

I was so nervous about us meeting, but BF assured me to just be myself. The initial meeting was polite. We made small talk, nothing crazy significant. It was nerve wracking and I felt a bit interrogated as they literally sat me down in the living room and just kind of all looked at me, but I expected it—this was new and awkward for all of them. After I left, his mom made lengthy comments about how my hair was highlighted and I ""had a lot of piercings"" (doubles and a cartilage), but seemed mostly okay with everything else. Neither of us thought it went *that* poorly.

But from then on, things escalated and they haven't stopped since. In the beginning his mother regularly stalked my Facebook profile and began to make judgmental comments about my appearance, style, and photos, claiming that I lacked class and that my boyfriend could do better. I'm not one to brag, but I'm really not a bad kid (good grades, school involvements, employed), and I generally interact well with parents. But none of my qualities mattered to her, because I didn't seem like a complacent, housewife-like girlfriend who would bend to BF's every need. Because I was too conversational and brazen, and that I seemed like I was mistreating my boyfriend by joking around with him sometimes. Which she gained all from one evening and a lot of Facebook stalking.

Initially I was of course upset, and often blamed myself over this. At one point I even dyed my hair back to being similar to my natural color. In the beginning I just thought she was a helicopter parent, and being overprotective of her ""son growing up."" As I'd also fought a lot with my mom over this in high school, I was as understanding and respectful as possible.

But over time it just got to a point where it didn't seem to be about me anymore. Every waking moment that BF had with her (s.a. breakfast, dinner, etc.) he would get lectured at about *something*. Usually it was always me – everything from berating him for his poor taste in girls, to speculating that my parents' divorce must be the reason why I'm messed up, and more – though it's sometimes other things (very recently, how he should stop hanging out with the club for which he is going to be president of next year, because all of his friends are bad influences and he can just make new, better friends). He got his driver's license, but could never come drive to see me (""because we own the car so we can tell you what you're allowed to use it for""). Whenever he called, he had to call after pretending to be sleeping, because he was forced to sleep by 11pm or so every night; before that, he'd have to shower, and before that, he'd be obligated to spending ""quality time"" right after dinner just getting lectured at even more. He then got caught a few times, and since, is no longer allowed to close his door, gets his phone taken away every night, and has had his ""bedtime curfew"" moved up to 10. He wanted to send me off at the airport when I left for Japan, but he was refused the car, and when he said he'd Uber instead, he was told that if he could afford an Uber he should just pay for his tuition while he was at it. Before you ask, his father and sister are not antagonistic, but no one in his family sticks up for him actively as they all just get bulldozed over. The prospects of being able to visit me over here during this year, in spite of him wanting to (and having enough internship money out of his own pocket to afford it), are grim.

I didn't realize or consider that this was emotional abuse until he said to me, verbatim, that he ""literally felt better anywhere than home."" The nonstop berating and constant threats to pull financial support have rendered my boyfriend feeling helpless. He has lost almost all of his confidence to be able to provide for me in this relationship. I'll admit that I've settled and compromised a lot because of his circumstances, but I've stuck with him through it all.

That brings us to now. In spite of all of this, we have stayed together and we have done our best to stay happy. In spite of all of this, he does still care for his family. For him, since he's been tolerating this his whole life, he's able to tolerate it longer (only raising more emotional-abuse flags imo). But with me in the mix, things are different. He's wary that if we continue on, his mom's not going to get better. He's hurting because he wants me in his life, but he doesn't want to subject me to this distress in the long term. So recently we've been talking a lot about whether there is even a future for us with all of this madness going on—he's graduating early (in one year), but is unsure about whether he'll be able to move out peacefully (which would probably be ideal). I recognize that I've made little to no effort to try to make her like me more, but I didn't feel safe at all entering that house this past summer. Now that I'm in Japan for a year, there's not much I can do anyway.

We're honestly feeling a bit stuck, because we are both committed to staying together. But there's no tangible next steps, and even if we are happy with each other, there's this constantly looming shadow over our heads. I'm just so unsure of what to do, because even though I'm really serious about him and am willing to go through this trouble with him, I feel like I need at least *some* kind of light at the end of the tunnel to get me through this. I can't force him to cut off his parents, and he won't force me to stay against my own will. But I want to stay with him, and for me currently, breaking up with him is not an option...but how long will this have to be our pain? We haven't even been dating for half a year—is all of this pain worth it for us?

I'm just trying to piece together what it really is that I want, but I'm really struggling.

TL;DR: Current BF and I have been dating since late March, long distance since the beginning of this month. His mother is emotionally abusive, also happens to hate me, and is trying to break us up. We are resolved to stay together, but are losing sight of a future because of the situation."
98st0f,1,2018-08-20,My [22F] boyfriend [21M] will get drunk and blow off our plans [LONG POST],wholegrainoates,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/98st0f/my_22f_boyfriend_21m_will_get_drunk_and_blow_off/,"Long time lurker, first time poster. My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost a year, and this has happened at least 6 to 8 times. For instance, we will make plans over text, in the morning, to meet up or go out to eat, or spend the night with each other, and won't here from him again all day and all night, and the plans are effectively cancelled. I have talked to him about this before, and he agreed that it was a problem, that when he drank he forgot about our plans, or to text and let me know he wasn't going to make it. That is totally not a problem, I love that he has fun when he is out, but this most recent time he has done it to me has left me hurt and confused.

For background, the last time I saw him for longer than an afternoon, was two months ago when I visited him at his summer internship in New York City. Then I left on a family vacation for three weeks, and because I was in a different time zone, and didn't have access to wifi, we spoke during those three weeks for no more than two hours a day.

Then a week ago, and I am moving into a new apartment on my birthday and he is supposed to come and help me move in, then we go to celebrate my birthday. Long story short, he is five hours late because he is helping build furniture for his sister, which was totally fine with me. But that meant I only got to see him for an evening, and he left early the next morning to drive back with his parents.

Flash forward to now, and he finally moves in yesterday afternoon, and we have plans to watch a movie and spend the night together before I have a long and intensive work week that will take up all my time. He tells me that he will see me later tonight, because he is getting lunch with an old, mutual friend around 1:45pm. I don't hear from him for five hours, so I text and ask if we are still going to see each other, it is now 10:00pm. I've had an especially long, and stressful day dealing with work, and I wanted to see him after basically a summer and a week apart. He finally texts me to let me know ""I'm just waiting on mutual friend and girlfriend to leave,"" but it is a drunk text. This mutual friend and my boyfriend have gotten together and gotten plastered in the past, so I also know I'm not just assuming he is drunk.

So I ask him if he is drunk, and if he was even planning on letting me know our plans were cancelled, and he doesn't respond. I wait three more hours to see if he will answer, and then I go to bed. An entire day has passed, and not once did he pick up the phone to let me know he was still out with the mutual friend, that he was day drinking, or that our plans were cancelled.

I just don't know what to do.

EDIT: I woke up this morning to his best friend calling me, and asking me if I knew where he was. Because he wasn't answering his phone, and his family was wondering/worried why he was an hour late to whatever they had planned. After a while he texts me the following: ""I'm sorry, I got too into hanging out with mutual friend and wasn't considerate (obvious understatement). We can talk about it later today, I don't think I'll be able to properly express my apology over text.""

**TL;DR my boyfriend and I make plans, he goes out and drinks, and then doesn't cancel or text me to let me know he won't make it.**"
98t623,3,2018-08-20,"I feel like I'm drifting apart from my girlfriend [ m/f, both 25] since she went on her semester abroad.",Bobbsen,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/98t623/i_feel_like_im_drifting_apart_from_my_girlfriend/,"So hey,

I just mostly wanted to say thanks beforehand to everyone reading this.

It's a tricky situation between my girlfriend and I currently. We've not been the most peaceful couple, we had a couple fights but mostly were very much happy together. We shared everything, texted each other all the time, sent pictures, were all lovey-dovey, told each other how much we love them all the time, you know how it is.

I guess I'll start with the background. Most issues that happened in the past were my fault. My girlfriend is, well, she's really clean and  hardworking to keep everything perfect. Before we met, I was your average nerdy sloppy dude and my Hygiene Standards kinda reflected that I guess. So obviously we had some falling out over that, but I think I changed a lot of this (not just because she told me to).

She stayed at my place for a couple of weeks when she gave up her apartment since she had to move abroad for 6 months and I really tried to make it perfect. Every morning before leaving for my internship, I made her breakfast and went over used stuff, cleaned the tables etc. I forgot some stuff from time to time tho, since I was in a hurry, and it kinda pissed her off. I get that. I'm forgetful and a dumbass and not yet used to this.

Hell, it pissed me off too. I went as far as finding a new place closer to the city last month and getting a lot of new stuff because I wanted to get rid of this shitty gamer lifestyle.

I like to think she does most things right. She always cared about me, and spent a lot of energy fixing MY problems even though she didn't have to. And I feel like an asshole, I left her hanging a couple times. I did care about her feelings, but still did stupid shit, like interrupting a conversation with her when a friend called and talked to him for a fucking hour.

 We were mostly good tho. When she left for Iceland, we cried in each other's arms before she went through the gate at the airport. She told me she'll miss me and loves me and that we have to FaceTime every day for a couple minutes.

The first 2 weeks it did go like that. She shared everything cool she sees, sent a ton of pictures of the nature there and I sent her updates of my life etc.

Like I said, I'm an idiot tho. Once she texted me about this awesome little hiking trip (~10km) near Reykjavik and she'll wait until I've finished work to share this with her. I was really excited to spend time with her. My plan for the day was to buy some work clothes tho and it didn't really cross my mind that you can't ""just combine this"". I fucked up and apologized. I swore to never do shit like that again.

I made a Facebook after having none for years, started researching everything about her university and events and activities in the city and she did a lot of that and shared it with me. We texted each day, but it got less and less.

I worked hard on my new apartment and shared everything with her, while she didn't text back for hours. This was all before her classes officially started. I never pressured her tho. I get she's busy. But she got annoyed at me, told me to leave her alone and that doesn't want to see me again. Next day she apologized. This happened like 3 times tho. Maybe I've gotten too needy. 

Anyways, her semester started, she joined this student union for economic students and went to a huge party organized by them. Same night I was out drinking with some friends.

She never drinks and sent me a lot of pictures of the games and it was cool that she shared this with me. I got home early at 01:00 (23:00 in her time zone) after only being away 2hrs and was laying on bed texting her back. I fell asleep shortly afterwards. I missed her texts for over an hour and she got pissed. She didn't believe I fell asleep because I was only home for like 20 minutes and didn't tell her after saying I was leaving the bar. She ignored me and I was pretty devastated and waited until 7am for her to get home safely that night and told her. She also was upset that I didn't ever go to the pub with her I went to. She was at the party for like 9 hours.

After that night, our conversations were held to a minimum tho. Like maybe once in the evening hey what did you do today?

I was trying really hard, but she had none of it. Told me leave her alone. She told me maybe I'm not the right guy for her next day. Day after we were talking again, but still superficially.

I'm not really sure what to do now. I don't want to believe that my relationship is beyond repair. I just feel.. like I don't play a role in her life anymore after leaving and my fuckups made it even worse. I'm an asshole, right? I don't want to be one.

She comes back for a couple days on the 29. and I'll pick her up from the airport. I hope I can fix it somehow. But I'm not sure I should completely leave her alone now. I don't want to bother her if she's pissed, but I also don't want to ignore her completely, I still want to be a part of her life.

I dunno this has been quite a text and not really well-formatted, but what's your opinion? I really love her with all my heart and want to save this relationship at all costs. I did stupid shit and deserve it I know, but I just want to see her happy.

Thank you.


Tldr: I fucked up, ignored girlfriend's needs, especially when she went to Iceland. I feel like she doesn't love me anymore and I'm not an important part of her life. We didn't really break up tho.
I dunno how to handle it. Should I leave her completely alone for a few days or text her occasionally a few lines(1-2 a day)? 

It's really hard for me to be this far away from her, never had to deal with this type of situation."
98use9,4,2018-08-20,I feel like I’ve doomed myself to a life of constant career failure and I don’t know what to do,ChiTownTJ,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/98use9/i_feel_like_ive_doomed_myself_to_a_life_of/,"I’m 24, male, and I’ve been working as a telemarketer for a year and a half. It’s my first job post college. I have a degree in business management, which I feel like is a complete mistake because my job doesn’t involve managing anything. I feel like no non-sales company is ever going to hire me because my education and experiences ONLY match that of sales and I HATE sales. 

Anytime I get an interview they always tell me that while I have a great personality and I’d fit in well, I don’t have the “necessary experience” and it shows in my answers to the interview questions. But how can I gain experience when the only thing I do is make calls all day?! There’s nothing to learn at all telemarketing! I can’t take that anywhere else so it’s really difficult for me to answer interview questions because I don’t have experience! So I feel like I’ve trapped myself into crappy jobs by doing this.

I don’t even know what I want to do! Everything I’m truly passionate about - writing, film, animals - does not lead to a successful life. I want to make money. But every career path I look at - IT, software developing, flight attending, hospitality - that I have at least a passing interest in either doesn’t pay great, won’t consider me because I don’t have the skills (which I’m willing to learn, but still), or sounds good but most people I hear talk about it are actually miserable in the role.

I don’t know what to do! I can’t just follow my passions because I’ll never make money in them/I’ll go broke following them, but the things that WILL make me money will make me wanna kill myself much like I do right now! So what do I do?! I feel completely trapped, like I put myself into a box by deciding to do THIS job as my first ever post-college job (I did an amazing internship with Disney before and some summer jobs but that’s it).

Did I trap myself into crappy jobs forever? Am I gonna have a miserable life because of the choices I made? I’ve legit feel like I’m a total failure right now, especially compared to everyone else in life. I feel like I’ll never be happy no matter what I do. Please help!!"

I graduate in December with a degree in Mechanical Engineering with a 3.1 GPA. I started working as an intern and have been promoted to working as an engineer, and long story short, I'm just not enjoying it. I spend too much time behind a computer and not enough time interacting with people and making an impact. After tearing my ACL 6 months ago, I fell in love with Physical Therapy. I have been working on Pre-Reqs and only have A&amp;P 2 and Chem 2 left.

I know that I can complete Pre-Reqs throughout the school year after applying. My question is, should I take the GRE ASAP &amp; apply now and take the pre-reqs throughout the school year? Or should I take a year off and really strengthen my application.

If I have a chance at getting in, I'd like to apply now and avoid taking a gap year. I'm just not sure because I know my GPA is low, but I also know that they allow lower GPA's if somebody's degree is in engineering. What should I do? Thanks

TL;DR: My GPA is only a 3.1 with an engineering degree. Should I hurry and take the GRE and apply this cycle? Or would that be a waste of time and money."
98vt5o,7,2018-08-20,[OPINION NEEDED] Struggles learning Java,vlad9727,learnjava,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjava/comments/98vt5o/opinion_needed_struggles_learning_java/,"Hello. I've been using Tim Buchalka's Java Masterclass Course to learn Java, but his challenges are pretty much giving me a headache, leaving me into just watching him solve them himself, and I feel like I'm forgetting most of the code I wrote, or the things I was supposed to learn. Finished yesterday the ""Java Collections"" segment and I feel like I haven't really learned anything in all these 127 videos. I was now thinking, on doing the MOOC.fi free course (which apparently doesn't really have that many advanced stuff compared to Tim's course), to do the exercises from there (Got to Part 2 last time i tried it, but would start from 4-5th week, just to be sure), and deepen the knowledge I already have (or don't).

I feel like I'm starting to dislike the whole programming think because I hardly find any joy at this point; my poor confidence hardly ever helps me either and now I've got into a tutorial video from "" [Brent Aureli's - Code School](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO9JvZ75Usyzgd1puurLF6A)"" on youtube, on building Super Mario Bros using LibGDX.

In the far, very far end, I would very much love to finish my studies (Economics and Computer Science (hardly any in the first 2 years, so far), get a Java internship somewhere and create games in my spare time. I always wanted to do something and ""put my name on it"".

Would u say this whole thing is a good idea, or should I just get back to Tim's Course and redo all the challenges?

EDIT:

Should I go with [Udacity course](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud405) on 2D Game Development with libGDX, instead of Brent Aureli's tutorial?"
98vxot,1,2018-08-20,Long Distance Troubles,SavePartOfYourself,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/98vxot/long_distance_troubles/,"Background:  met a girl from A Nordic country whilst she was doing a teaching internship.  We fell in love.  She came to visit me once since her internship and I spent 2 weeks across the Atlantic with her family in her world.

We spoke every day, either FB video, chat, or text.  She recently had to cancel her next trip over in the next month due to school and meetings that go with it.  There was some strain before this happened.  

She has been swamped with work and trying to get everything in line as she prepares for her thesis and getting ready to start a career.  

We’ve spoken of the future, she wanted to be sure before she moved here, although I have seriously considered and even looked into moving to her home country.  

This past Thursday after my family dog had passed I told her that I knew she needed space and time, but that I wanted to talk to her, she’s always on my mind, etc...  She responded with saying that everything just got way too intense.  And that she’s not in a place to deal with other people’s needs, that she doesn’t want a relationship right now.  She said she was sorry and didn’t want to waste my time and that she couldn’t do this right now.  I responded with apologies over putting pressure on her and that I would stop, that I would give her space and time.  And that I hope that we can talk about what she needs from me in the relationship.  That I thought I had done something wrong.  I was trying to fix it.  She responded to that with ‘right now that’s just how I feel, and I’m sorry’.

Should I take this as a break up or a timeout?  I know that she is the one.  I have never felt about another person the way I feel about her.  We had plans for me to go over to her in December.  Her thesis isn’t until February.  I need to know anything, space is hard.  Am I overthinking?  Should I consider us through?


Update:
There have been two conversations had between the two of us since all of this has gone down.  

The first happened this past Monday (Labor Day).  Her ‘American’ family member had told her that I was struggling, and that I deserved an explanation.  That for things to end like this is unacceptable and that I thought we were going to spend our lives together.  And that, until the end, she thought so too.  She called me, after messaging me and saying that she “had five minutes”.  I was told that involving people in our relationship, her hearing things from her friends here about what I had said about us, the plans we’d made, etc.  was just too much..  that she had tried to tell me, but that I just wouldn’t listen.  I told her that I wanted to work it out, and asked if she still had feelings for me.  She said that she didn’t have romantic feelings anymore, which is not what she told her American family.  The conversation broke my heart, but I needed to hear it from her...

Fast forward to yesterday.  Her American family member had sent a message to her saying how disappointed she was with how she had handled the breakup with me.  That I had deserved an explanation and not just a shut down from her.  She went on to say, maybe that’s how you do things there, but that’s not how adults here react, and act.  I got a message from her asking if I had a second.  I was explained all of this, and told that this is exactly why you don’t involve people in plans and situations.  I reassured her that I have had nothing but good intentions and good things to say about her.  That I want her to be happy, with or without me.  That I had been doing some soul searching and that I thought it was kind of funny, because I had also been fighting rumors about us from students and adults alike about our relationship, such as her next visit, when she’s moving, if she’s moving etc...  I also asked her if the relationship was as serious as I thought it had been.  She said yes, at one point it was.  But that everything had become too much.  She mentioned that she would need some distance for a while, it wouldn’t be a month, but it wouldn’t be tomorrow, and that she would reach out to me.  I screwed up and asked her if there was any chance for us, she responded ‘did you?- you just ask that?  Do you not listen-‘ I cut her off and said yes, I shouldn’t have asked that.  Told her to tell her mom and friends I say hello, and to take care.  She said the same.  

Is this something to take hope in?  Should I take this time to try and better not only myself but also my understanding of the situation?  Looking back I became so focused on the future I ignored the issues we were having until it became unbearable for her.  When things were getting hard I tried to be as present as possible, especially after my family dog passed, which she sent the first “this is too much” text after I reached out to her after I told her I two days previous would give her space.  I also learned that there is no one else in the picture.  

I’m trying to view this as level headed as possible, but I keep fantasizing about a possible future with her.  She has a lot on her plate, and so do I.  I know that there is a deep meaningful connection between the two of us, I have a gut feeling about us ending up together.  Maybe this is the pause or break we needed?

So far I haven't had much luck with getting summer internships. But I'm specializing in Systems and Network Administration so I'm not too interested in software development but more on computer networking and I want to build a better resume around that.

I've been involved in different extracurricular activities over the semesters as a means of building my resume as best as I can that also involves working on campus, but I'll be taking the important core classes of the major in the fall.

So with my thoughts of trying to gain research with a professor or an internship during this fall, I don't know what would be the most effective approach to prepare myself as an ISE senior, I prefer not to go job hunting after I graduate and instead have an already existing network established or a list of experience gained from different programs/activities.

98we35,274,2018-08-20,[Residency] Things I Wish I Knew About Residency Applications,MadDogWest,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/98we35/residency_things_i_wish_i_knew_about_residency/,"Background: I'm an OBGYN intern who doesn't feel like studying for Step 3 right now, so I thought I'd share some advice I've shared with students below me when I was in school, with my 4th year AIs now, and with a few of you on this subreddit via PM. 

I was an applicant coming from a middle of the road US MD school with below average Step scores, below average number of research experiences (had one paper in the process of being submitted and one finishing up research at the time of interviews), and no poster presentations or anything like that. Pretty generic, slightly below-average applicant overall. I matched at a middle of the road university program and I'm happy with where I matched, but I think there were some things I could've done to have more success in terms of applications and getting interviews. 

Some of these will be rather obvious, but hopefully some of you who have *not* done the obvious things will be encouraged by this post to do those things.

---------------------------

**1) Don't be afraid to apply broadly, even if it's costly.**

This seems like a no-brainer, but I see so many applicants (and had so many friends) hesitant to add another 10-20 programs onto their list either because it was too expensive or because everyone they know is only applying to X number of programs. And, certainly, if every person applies to every program, then there will be a massive logjam. But the reality is that you need to apply to the number of programs that **you** feel most comfortable with, even if everyone around you says they're applying to far fewer. *Don't let your perception of your colleagues' applications influence how you apply.*

The advice I received was to look at [Charting Outcomes](http://www.nrmp.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Charting-Outcomes-in-the-Match-2018-Seniors.pdf), find your field of choice and the chart with probability of matching vs. number of contiguous ranks, approximate 95%, then apply to 3-4x that many programs based on how competitive you were. For OBGYN, that would mean aiming for 12-13 interviews and applying to ~50 programs--right about the national average for the 2017 cycle (EDIT: you can find average number of applications here: https://www.aamc.org/services/eras/stats/359278/stats.html by choosing ""by applicant"" -&gt; field -&gt; then looking at the far right column). 

*However*, I applied to roughly double that. In hindsight, that was a bit excessive, but it was my thinking (and I think it should be yours) that pinching a few pennies now and only applying to 50-60 programs wasn't worth the trade-off of not matching. **At this point, the only statistic you can change about your chances of matching is number of interviews you go on.** Adding an additional 20 programs will cost an additional $500+, sure, but **not matching would cost *significantly* more.** Not matching means you will have:

* Wasted thousands of dollars this cycle on applications/travel
* Lost ~$50,000 in next year's salary
* Lost an additional year's worth of interest on your loans
* Have to pay an additional year's cost of living without salary to cover it
* Will enter next year's cycle with a red flag as a re-applicant

tl;dr--don't be afraid to add another dozen or so programs (scale accordingly based on field) to your application list. Better to over-apply and match, than to be sitting mid-October with 4-5 interviews and wondering when ""the second wave"" will come. I had a classmate (more competitive than I) in that exact scenario who ended up having to blast out a second round of applications in a panic. Don't be that person.

**2) Don't be afraid to send some early letters of interest to programs.**

There's a constant debate about how to send letters at the *end* of interview season--I don't have much of an opinion on that outside of maybe sending a letter to your #1. But it is definitely worth your while to send letters **early in the process** (read: early October). A classmate of mine garnered an extra 3-4 interviews just by emailing programs and telling them that she was especially interested. 

At the time, I thought this was absurd because 1) My interest should've been clear by submitting an application and 2) It's not like programs hold open spots for people who send them emails, right? I can't answer that second question, but it worked well for her, and I also managed to get an interview for myself by sending a few emails of interest--but far later in the game (mid to late October) than she did. I'll always wonder if I could've scored another 3-4 interviews by sending some early emails showing my specific interest in particular programs.

Yes, this anecdote could easily be explained by the programs already intending to send her an invite, and that her email changed nothing. However--it seems that it could cause little damage to send an email expressing interest, and the gain of even one interview is *tremendous*. Further, if you're offered an interview before a cluster of interviews go out, you're ahead of the game in terms of ease of scheduling. On that note: 

**2b) One thing I didn't 100% realize** 

...was that programs *often send out more interview invites than they have available for any given day*. It's beating a dead horse to say it but it's always worth repeating: during September and October, try to be available, with your phone, with emails sending you push notifications so that you don't miss an invite and end up on a wait list. If necessary, have a parent/SO/friend who can access your emails and schedule an interview for you. You can't really change your schedule at this point, but try to be available--I missed an interview at a great program because I received the invite while I was stuck in the OR for an unexpected case.

(Why programs don't just send out batches day after day only extending as many offers as they have interview positions... I don't know. But just be aware.)

**3) Practice some [behavioral questions](https://www.themuse.com/advice/30-behavioral-interview-questions-you-should-be-ready-to-answer), even if you feel like you interview well.**

I've always interviewed well, I'm very social, and, though I expected to have some tough questions, I was 100% unprepared for some of the tougher questions I received. 

90% of my interviewers were laid back and asked routine questions. At two programs in particular, though, I received a blistering of behavioral questions--essentially straight behavioral questions for two hours straight. The first was easily the worst interview I've ever had. And, unless you've thought about questions in advance, it's really hard to come up with an example that fits their ""tell me about a time when..."" line. 

Take a few minutes and develop some answers to 10-20 behavioral questions. Even if those specific questions aren't asked, you'll have some stories/scenarios in mind that can be applied to other questions. You'd be amazed how easily you can contort one story to fit a question *so long as you don't have to think of a story in the first place*.

**4) Regional bias is real**

I applied pretty evenly across the country, but my interviews clustered near me and within my region. Expect this and, if you would like to move outside of your region, apply accordingly (read: broadly, showing interest, and having a specific reason why you want to go there). When interviewing outside of your region, be prepared to answer at least one or two questions about why you'd like to move there (both in the interview and at the dinner the night before). 

**5) You will be best served by ranking programs based on where you think you will be most happy**

I had always anticipated ranking programs purely based off of prestige and competitiveness. I ended up changing that at the last minute, and I think for the better. It will not be worth it to you to go to a slightly better program if you are miserable for four years because you ranked it for the name rather than the people. I was never a believer in the ""gut feeling"", but I 100% was by the end of the cycle. Certainly you want to go somewhere that will enable you to be successful (especially if you're fellowship bound), but try to balance happiness with prestige.

On that note--**keep a list of notes about each program.** You'll be surprised what you forget.

&amp;nbsp;    
Hierbij zend ik u de antwoorden op de vragen van het lid Stoffer &amp;#40;SGP&amp;#41; aan de minister van Infrastructuur en Waterstaat over de sterke toename van het aantal ongelukken met vrachtwagens en de betrokkenheid van buitenlandse chauffeurs &amp;#40;ingezonden 13 juli 2018&amp;#41;.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 1  
&amp;nbsp;    
Heeft u kennisgenomen van het bericht dat het aantal ongevallen met vrachtwagens vorig jaar sterk is toegenomen ten opzichte van 2016?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 1  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja.  
&amp;nbsp;    
   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 2  
&amp;nbsp;    
Hoe waardeert u het feit dat bij incidenten op Nederlandse snelwegen in 40% van de gevallen een buitenlandse vrachtwagenchauffeur is betrokken, terwijl ongeveer 13% van het totaal aantal vrachtwagens op de Nederlandse wegen een buitenlands kenteken heeft?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 2  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het STIMVA rapport laat inderdaad zien dat buitenlandse chauffeurs relatief vaker stranden of een ongeluk veroorzaken. Alle bedrijven en chauffeurs, ook de buitenlandse, moeten goed opgeleid en met veilig materieel de weg op.   
&amp;nbsp;    
   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 3  
&amp;nbsp;    
In hoeverre zou het voorgaande te maken kunnen hebben met verschillen in opleiding tussen Nederlandse en buitenlandse chauffeurs en met verschillen in de technische staat van vrachtwagens?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 3  
&amp;nbsp;    
De top 4 van landen waarvan chauffeurs betrokken zijn bij incidenten bestaat uit Europese lidstaten &amp;#40;Polen, Duitsland, Roemenië en België&amp;#41;. Transportondernemingen en chauffeurs uit alle Europese lidstaten moeten zich houden aan de Europese wetgeving omtrent rijvaardigheid en vakbekwaamheid van chauffeurs en vrachtwagens moeten door de APK plicht voldoen aan technische eisen.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 4  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bent u bereid onderzoek te laten doen naar de sterke toename van het aantal ongevallen met vrachtwagens en de onevenredige betrokkenheid van buitenlandse chauffeurs?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 4  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het STIMVA rapport geeft aan dat een van de redenen van de sterke toename van het aantal meldingen komt door een verbeterde samenwerking tussen de bergingsbedrijven en de wegbeheerders. Daarnaast worden gestrande vrachtauto’s eerder aan wegbeheerders gemeld door ontsluiting van data van serviceproviders. Ook is een deel te verklaren door de aantrekkende economie en daarmee de toename van goederenvervoer over de weg en toename van het verkeer.  
&amp;nbsp;    
In de media wordt gesproken over een relatieve oververtegenwoordiging van buitenlandse chauffeurs op basis van het Grootschalig VerkeersOnderzoek Goederenvervoer Randstad 2016 waarbij door RWS onderzoek is gedaan naar het aantal en aandeel buitenlandse vrachtwagens op de Nederlandse autosnelwegen. Hierbij is gebruik gemaakt van 45 meetpunten in de Randstad. Het aandeel buitenlands vrachtverkeer bedraagt gemiddeld 13% ten opzichte van alle vrachtwagens.  
&amp;nbsp;    
De gegevens van het RWS onderzoek en die van de STIMVA laten zich echter moeilijk vergelijken. Het land dat het kenteken uit heeft gegeven komt lang niet altijd overeen met de nationaliteit van de chauffeur. Ook kan een vrachtwagen met een buitenlands kenteken en/of een buitenlandse chauffeur een Nederlandse eigenaar hebben.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Om de oorzaken van de betrokkenheid van buitenlandse chauffeurs nader te specificeren is gedetailleerde informatie van alle incidenten noodzakelijk. Gezien het feit dat afhankelijk van het incident verschillende organisaties, zoals bergingsbedrijven, wegbeheerders of politie, andere gegevens verzamelen, is geen compleet beeld van de oorzaken te achterhalen. Uit de informatie uit verschillende bronnen waar we over beschikken kan niet worden achterhaald wat precies de oorzaak is van de ongevallen.   
&amp;nbsp;    
   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 5  
&amp;nbsp;    
Neemt u de genoemde cijfers en de bijbehorende problematiek mee bij de voorbereiding van het Strategisch Plan Verkeersveiligheid 2030?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 5  
&amp;nbsp;    
In het Strategisch Plan Verkeersveiligheid 2030 breng ik in kaart wat de belangrijkste risico’s zijn voor verkeersveiligheid. Ongelukken met vrachtwagens zijn daar onderdeel van.  
&amp;nbsp;    
   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 6  
&amp;nbsp;    
Wat vindt u van de oproep van brancheorganisaties Transport en Logistiek Nederland &amp;#40;TLN&amp;#41; om appen achter het stuur technisch onmogelijk te maken en tot die tijd in te zetten op meer handhaving en hogere sancties?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 6  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ik kan me helemaal vinden in de oproep om appen achter het stuur technisch onmogelijk te maken. Ik vind het belangrijk dat er gewerkt wordt aan een bedrijfscultuur waarbij de norm is dat je elkaar niet stoort onderweg. Dit is een belangrijke taak voor zowel TLN als werkgevers. Begin september wordt de nieuwe campagne Aandacht in het verkeer gelanceerd en daarbij horen, naast technische hulpmiddelen, ook materialen die werkgevers intern kunnen inzetten.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Ten aanzien van de strafmaat geldt dat de minister van JenV die wil verhogen in die gevallen waarin het gebruik van een mobiel device concreet gevaar oplevert. Dit is opgenomen in het wetsvoorstel aanscherping strafrechtelijke aansprakelijkheid ernstige verkeersdelicten. Ook wordt gewerkt aan manieren om de pakkans voor handheld telefoongebruik te vergoten.

After half a year's effort, I finally managed to make a transition from classroom teaching to ISD with two standing offers.

But, picking between the two is incredibly difficult for me...

I will write down the pros and cons, along with my thought processes in identifying those pros/cons.

I would deeply appreciate your advice as a working professional.


Offer 1.

An International level corporate in safety-related business.

Pros.
-	Really good review on worker satisfaction and company reputation. (And, it is a well-known entity in their field)

-	Significantly better ‘technology’.    Due to its size and its nature of the business, technology is really a niche…in terms of learning opportunity.

-	Professional Growth Opportunity.  It is a company where I can grow within as an ISD. (If I do accept this position, I will not be an ‘Instructional Designer’, but the related role of developing handouts, PDFs, PPT. etc.  So, it is a related role.  But, during the interview, they did say they are interested in expanding their business to eLearning as well.)

-	Better benefits

-	Better company culture from what I observed at the job site &amp; read from online reviews. 

Cons.

-	The job title is not ‘Instructional Designer’ or ‘eLearning developer’. (But the related role that works with L &amp; D department)
-	Lower pay.  Because of the difference in role/job description, compensation is 3~4k lower. 

-	My experience and skills are not a 100% match for the position. (But, they are something I think I can learn within 2 - 3 weeks.  I have the foundational skills, just have to add on some additional skills.)

Offer 2.

A national level company in outsourcing training related business.

Pros

-	I WILL work as an instructional designer. (With an Official title of ISD)

-	Slightly better pay, but I can handle that 3~4k pay cut.

-	I believe my skills and experiences are 100% match with the job description. (Based on the conversation from the interview)

Cons

-	Although most of the bad reviews are from the outsourcing interns, I found MANY bad reviews on the company from Glassdoor, Indeed, etc.  Although my experience as a full-time employee might be different, it does show the company’s management style and culture.

-	They didn’t share the benefits in detail in their offer letter.  They only provided a very vague line of ‘healthcare and paid time off’ without any details…indicating some red flag for me personally.

-	Company reputation is not as good as the other company.

-	I don’t see much growth opportunity within the company.  If I want to make advances in my career, I would have to move out of the company, instead of within.

Anyway, here are what I thought were Pros &amp; Cons of two companies I have an offer from.

What do you guys think?

(I do have another interview tomorrow morning, but it is a contract through an agency, rather than full time…..so I think I would go with one of these two)

What's good for the goose is good for the gander...,testudoaubreii,mormonpolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/mormonpolitics/comments/98wzqr/kavanaughs_scathing_recommendations_on_dealing/,"[The Washington Post is reporting](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/brett-kavanaugh-memo-detailed-explicit-questions-for-clinton/2018/08/20/c0854616-a488-11e8-8fac-12e98c13528d_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.d87332907e22) on a memo ([full text here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/apps/g/page/politics/read-the-memo-from-brett-kavanaugh-to-judge-starr/2322/)) written in 1998 by Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court, when he was working for Ken Starr in his investigation of President Clinton. 

Consider what this likely future Justice wrote in regard to how the sitting President should be treated in light of where we are today:

&gt; After reflecting this evening, I am strongly opposed to giving the President any ‘break’ in the questioning regarding the details of the Lewinsky relationship... unless ... he resigns or ... confesses perjury. ... The idea of going easy on him at the questioining is thus abhorrent to me. ... The President has discgraced his Office, the legal system, and the American people. ... He has required the urgent attention of the courts and the Supreme Court for frivolous privilege claims — all to cover up his oral sex from an intern. He has lied to his aides. He has lied to the American people. He has tried to disgrace you and this Office with a sustained propaganda campaign that would make Nixon blush.

I frankly have no argument with Kavanaugh's sensibilities here regarding President Clinton. This is how our ""checks and balances"" are supposed to work. And, in terms of our situation today, I think President Trump is slowly realizing he has far fewer friends than he thought (as evidenced by his increasingly erratic flailing around on twitter). That's what a life of lying, cheating, and being disloyal to people will get you."

Multiple covers on Times magazine. A spate of chat show appearances. You're one of the most successful and well recognised businessmen in the country. And all that before you've turned 40. 

Yet you never forgot your roots. Coming from a poor single-parent family, you know it took a lot of graft, and even more luck, to get to where you are today. And you don't want to be one of those businessmen who pull up the ladder behind you. Instead, you've decided to run an outreach programme, allowing one lucky young man from a similar background to you to experience a few months alongside you. You'll allow them to experience the world of big business, giving them an internship in one of your companies, as well as personally giving them lessons on the dos and don'ts of the professional world. And as an added bonus, you'll let them live in your multi-million dollar mansion!

But regardless of whether you want to admit it or not, there's a deeper reasoning behind your decision. Years of toil on your businesses has resulted in you neglecting your social life. You haven't had a stable relationship with a woman in years, let alone brought any children into the world. And sitting at night in your empty mansion, you feel overwhelmingly alone. You could get almost any woman in the world, of course, but most of them are just after your money, not after you. What you want is protégé, a companion, someone who cares about *who* you are, not *what* you have. And that's the real reason behind this programme. 

I'm your average 18 year old guy. I play video games, I go out with my friends, I refuse to clean my room. When I left High School, I thought the world would open up for me. But after rejection after rejection, I could see my future closing up. When I applied to your programme, it was one last throw of the dice, one futile hope at a future beyond blue-collar boredom. And to my surprise, my amazement, I actually got in!

However, when you finally meet me, seeing my surprisingly big eyes, lithe body and firm ass, you start getting different ideas, taboo ideas, ideas which you desperately try to suppress but fail to. In this young man you don't see a man, you see a woman, you see a daughter, you see a lover. And using your influence, you're going to try you best to bring this woman out into the open.

Hi there! As the prompt suggests, I'm looking for a feminisation prompt based around a CEO turning me into their slutty new daughter. I will play a young man (18+) who has won the opportunity to be your intern for the summer. You will play a CEO, either male or female, who takes me on as an intern, but increasingly views me as a substitute slutty daughter. 

I would like this prompt to focus on our thoughts, feeling and emotions. For me, I want to be torn between my male identity, and the desire to be a wanted, loved and desired daughter. For you, you will struggle between wanting to give this young man a constructive and educative summer, and wanting to cave into your more carnal desires by turning him into your new slutty daughter. Of course the sex will come, but I'd also like there to be lots of character development and sexual tension. 

My main kinks are romance, feminisation, incest, cumplay/bukkake/gokkun, D/s (with me as the s) outfits and lingerie, build-up, free use, taking orders, name calling and group sex. My limits are u18s, excessive pain, non-con and skat/watersports. 

I try to respond at least once per day, although sometimes real life will get in the way. I write in the first person present, and generally try to write detail, liking around 3 paragraphs per response (although of course that fluctuates). In your response, I'd like you to include a little bit about your character, your kinks, and how you imagine this RP developing. I usually leave prompts up a little while before replying, so don't feel the need to rush your response. I'll try and reply to everyone, but one line messages probably won't get a response."

I'm on a throwaway because some friends know my account and I'd really rather not have this floating in my social circles.

I'm 21 and living with roommates while working full time and trying to squeeze in college. I've only completed one class and got a B in it at my local community college. I guess I'm here to ask for advice and help.

I'm currently separated and I'm supposed to be getting my daughter in two more years. My major is computer science, but so far I've only done one class. I work 7 days a week, roughly around 52 hours, and I take home about 624. I was planning on doing some clep tests and self studying this semester while working, then resuming school in the spring. 

Right now my current financial situation is something like this:

Monthly bills

Rent: 175
Electric: 60
Gym: 35
Internet: 40
Car insurance: 130
Phone: 60
Water: 45
Food/toiletries: 200
Guinea pigs: 50
Child support: 324 (until I receive my daughter in two more years)

I have about 5,600 in credit card debt with decent interest, and I owe my mother 4,000. I borrowed from her and accrued the credit card debt when I hired my lawyer for custody after the father went to jail.

I guess my big question is what should I or can I be doing right now? I will be applying for internships for next summer/fall and will hopefully get them but I don't want to count on something that might not be a sure thing. I am planning on donating plasma twice a week every month which should be an extra 300 I can push towards my debt. Honestly, I feel lost and tired constantly, and was just seeking some advice from others. Thank you in advance."
98y0xa,15,2018-08-20,"Ingenium: The Rise, Fall and Future of Iida Tenya!",Sparowes,BokuNoHeroAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/98y0xa/ingenium_the_rise_fall_and_future_of_iida_tenya/,"I've seen a lot of discussion about Iida's lack of feats recently (and his popularity taking a hit as a result) and conjecture about whether his potential as a fighter has stalled (no pun intended) or if he will get the spotlight back again eventually and improve his general combat skills or abilities with **Engine**.  


Two of the main strikes against Iida becoming relevant as a hero in combat once more seem to stem from two characters in particular, Deku and Gran Torino (and perhaps Bakugo to a lesser extent) and how their Quirks seem to make his irrelevant by comparison. I would like to address these characters here in this post, explain why I don't think Tenya has become forever irrelevant as a fighter and then discuss how his Quirk could be honed or used in different ways or improved to keep him competitive. So, apologies in advance for the long post if you're not interested!  

&amp;nbsp;


###Midoriya


First, let's start with Deku. Midoriya's growing control over **One for All** has certainly made him a force and he's destined to, like All Might before him, simply be the best Hero and there's no way around it. Not only does he have incredible strength and endurance, but especially now that he has been using the *Full Cowling*, his speed has reached a pretty high level as well with a sub-100% OFA seeming to be slower, but not substantially slower than a *Recipro Burst* from Tenya's **Engine** Quirk. Obviously the problem here is that without Tenya getting a significant buff, Midoriya will eventually eclipse Iida completely in the area he was supposed to specialize in (speed). I don't see this as a problem or even particularly surprising, however, as Midoroya was *always* going to become the strongest and fastest hero thanks to **One For All** and his status as the main character. A secondary character being overshadowed by the main character is par for the course in a shonen series and Izuku's abilities being compared to Tenya's isn't really a fair comparison due to their respective levels of importance to the story. I think the only real problem, however, is that they've shifted to Deku using a more kick-based fighting style which takes away Iida's niche when speed isn't taken into account. I feel like this decision is the most harmful to Iida's growth and any potential power increase because not only will he never be as fast as Deku as he further masters **One for All**, but now Horikoshi has even stripped away the one main difference in their fighting styles where before Iida was the kicking guy and Midoriya the punching (or flicking, on occassion) guy. I honestly feel like this was one of the few legitimately bad decisions by the mangaka and hurts Tenya the most while not really being necessary for Midoriya to be the strongest hero. But again I can look past it for the most part since Izuku is still the protagonist and the main character in these stories always ends up leaps and bounds ahead of their allied supporting characters... with very few exceptions like, for example, say, Luffy and Zoro in *One Piece* who seem to always stay around the same tier even if Luffy almost certainly has a slight edge as the main character of the manga or Naruro and Sasuke in *Naruro* who basically ended as equals. 


But all in all, I think comparing anyone to Midoriya is kind of a bad faith argument as he is destined to be the strongest and will eventually outshine everyone in physical strength, speed, agility, endurance, durability and pure destructive potential. Such is the way of the shonen manga and such is the nature of **One for All** as a Quirk.  


&amp;nbsp;

###Sorahiko


Next, I've seen people say that the introduction of Gran Torino in the Stain arc and his **Jet** Quirk also make Iida's **Engine** seem notably weaker by comparison as Sorahiko seems to move faster and still hits with enough power to take out a Nomu or several other villains in a single blow. This argument is one that I feel I can defend against a bit better for several reasons and one which I feel has issues that aren't often addressed when comparing their Quirks. 


The first point that I feel needs to be addressed, however, is that Gran Torino is a veteran Hero who has almost certainly mastered his Quirk to its fullest potential and who has very high-level general fighting skills and ample experience (he did train All Might!) while Tenya is a 15-16 year old high school student Hero-in-training that isn't even out of UA yet and thus we can pretty easily conclude that not only has Iida not reached the full potential of his Quirk, but he still has a lot of time and space to grow as a combatant, leader and general Hero and there's little reason to think that he won't notably improve in all of these areas as his training continues and he matures further. Whether his all-around melee skills ever match Gran Torino is questionable, I think it's not only believable, but possibly even probable that Tenya's pure speed, intelligence and kicking/leg strength will all match or surpass Gran Torino though.


The second point that I would like to address is the idea that some hold that states that **Jet** is, in fact, a much superior version of **Engine** in a sense. While I can see why some hold this view, with Sorahiko's base speed seeming to be much higher than Iida's, I feel like there are some key points being ignored here. While it does seem true that **Jet** allows Gran Torino to move notably faster than Iida can (and certainly seems to have an big agility advantage), what we have seen him using appears to be the peak speed of **Jet** and he doesn't appear to have any special techniques or levels to his Quirk. At the same time, Iida's *Recipro Burst*, while having a massive drawback, seems to put him at least on par with Gran Torino's speed already and *Recipro Extend*'s further speed boost may even make him faster than Gran Torino for a short burst when he is able to use it. While **Jet** still seems to pack more of a punch (or kick) than **Engine**'s RB and even RE (as shown by the difference in damage to Stain compared to the various villains we have seen Gran Torino take out with one or few strikes), I think this can be attributed to Gran Torino's genersl strength being higher than Iida's from his own training, experience fighting villains as a pro Hero, and teaching someone like All Might during his year as a professor at UA as much or more than suggesting that Iida's kicks are inherently weaker in damage potential. I think we could (and hopefully will) see Iida improve the power of his strikes eventually to the point that he can perform similar or better feats. 


The third point when on the subject of Gran Torino's speed making him a better version of Iida is what seems to me to be the lack of acknowledging the drawbacks of the **Jet** Quirk. While **Engine** and its hindrance of Tenya's leg engines stalling if he uses his higher speed moves are well known, I don't feel like I've seen many (if anyone) discuss the limits of Gran Torino's **Jet**. While it's definitely a really good and strong (and personally, I think very cool) Quirk, **Jet** definitely has its own negative sides. The first and perhaps most important is that to propel himself at speed, Gran Torino relies on his own breath to power the air bursts in the soles of his feet. This alone limits how long he can use his Quirk with each burst, as he needs to inahale again to launch successive times if he runs out of breath. While this hasn't really been shown to be an issue thus far, when thinking about a scenario where Gran Torino would potentially be fighting someone nearly as fast as himself or someone strong enough to literally knock the breath out of him if they land a hit, it could basically result in his Quirk stalling not unlike **Engine** does after a *Recipro Burst*... and it can actually sometimes take much longer than expected to catch your breath in such situations if hit in the right spot, something I unfortunately know too well as an amateur boxer, haha! Now, granted Gran Torino has a lot more experience using his Quirk and thus knows his limitations better so that this is probably taken into account for his fighting style, it is still a potential massive drawback -- in theory he could become essentially Quirkless if he found himself in a prolonged battle or rescue operation involving any kind of poison gas or large amounts of smoke or other things tha may hinder his breathing. 

The next drawback to **Jet** is semi-related to the first. The fact that to maintain any actual flight, he must be exhaling his breath leads to him using his Quirk more to propel himself off of various surfaces where he can pause to breath in and launch again in quick succession. This makes Gran Torinon incredibly agile and especially dangerous in an area that is confined or has many obstacles from which he can pause to re-launch himself, but it also likely means that he is actually substantially less effective on an open terrain or against anyone with a Quirk that can alter or affect the surrounding area like with Kurogiri's **Warp Gates**, Overhaul's **Overhaul**, Cementoss' **Cement**, or class 1-B's Juzo's **Softening** as well as any others with similar Quirks. Iida on the other hand excels in open spaces where he can get to his highest speed (outside of RB/RE) and can navigate obstacles fairly well without having to stop, inhale and relaunch. Now I'm not saying this makes Tenya as strong as Gran Torino right now at all, clearly he is not, nor am I saying that his **Engine** Quirk is better. I am just pointing out the potential downsides to **Jet** to further explain why I don't think it makes Iida's speed irrelevant as I believe it has its own strengths and weaknesses when the two are compared while also recognizing that Iida almost certainly has a lot of room to grow and become stronger and faster while Gran Torino likely reached his peak long ago.   

&amp;nbsp;

###Ingenium!


Finally we get to Iida Tenya himself, the UA Hero Course class 1-A President, a legacy hero from a famous Pro Hero family, the student in his class with the second highest grades, and the joint holder of third-place in the first year UA Sports Festival! Iida was introduced early on as one of our heroic protagnist Deku's first and closest friends in UA High School along with Uraraka and has consistently scored in the top 10 in popularity polls, with a high showing of number 5! He was one of the most important secondary characters for most of beginning of the series all the way through to the highy-lauded Stain Arc where he got his best character development. And then something happened. Tenya has slowly faded from the spotlight and many fans seem to be abandoning him as not being as interesting as he once was or proclaiming that his Quirk has reached its limit or that he can never catch up with other characters now. While I believe Iida's lack of focus is simply a result of Horikoshi wanting to give some other 1-A students some spotlight (like Kirishima, who doesn't love that guy?) to flesh them out, others are more cynical. Some say his spot as one of the major secondary characters was taken by Todoroki due to the latter's popularity... and there may be some truth to that (which personally kind of bums me out as, while I like Todoroki well enough, he feels super generic to me in terms of powers), but I choose to believe (or perhaps simply want to) that Horikoshi hasn't forgotten about our bespectacled and armor-clad speedster and we will get more focus on Tenya again in the future and he will finally show some improvements to keep him from being totally left in the dust by other secondary characters like Kirishima, Tokoyami, and maybe even Shoto... well a man can dream on that last part at least, right? Anyway, in this section I'll be listing the ways that I believe Iida Tenya can become relevant again in terms of combat power and general leadership and try to repair the belief that he may have been left behind to forever exist as a minor background character with an underwhelming Quirk. 

* Improving his Quirk

I'll start off with what I think is the thing most needed to keep Iida relevant and competitive as well as what many see to be the ceiling he has hit. Tenya needs to improve his ability to use **Engine** significantly! Not only do we need to see Iida develop better control of his Quirk, we need to see him developing new ways of using it.   


The first, and most obvious way to improve him quickly would be to allow him to use *Recipro Burst* speeds for a longer period of time or perhaps even better to make the old RB speeds his new default **Engine** running speed limit without using the technique itself while enhancing the *Recipro Burst* technique and in turn *Recipro Extend* so that they are much, much faster! We know that training the body and using the Quirk more and more increases its power and efficiency as well as the user's control, so having Iida use RB more often until he is able to hold those speeds without overheating his leg engines would make sense as a rational way to increase both his speed and his kicking power.  


Another option, or perhaps one that would work great in conjunction with at least him being able to use RB for a longer period of time and with a lower cool down is to give him another technique that goes even further than *Recipro Extend*'s speed! Another level of overclocking his **Engine** Quirk that could come with the old downsides of stalling after usage and a time limit while drastically increasing his speed would be awesome! Imagine a -- for the sake of this thread lets call it *Recipro Flash* or something -- okay, now imagine a technique that burns not red or blue, but white hot and clear and allows Iida to move much faster than Gran Torino and reach (though maybe not attain, let's be realistic) near-All Might level speed! Maybe he can only use it for three or five seconds instead of ten and maybe the cool down is longer, maybe to use it he has to have fueled up an obscene amount of delicious orange juice first, maybe it leaves him temporarily injured like an uncontrolled **One for All**... but maybe it also gives him a handful of seconds as a true-to-God ""fuck the sound barrier and your ability to be able to keep up with my movements"" speedster and the terror of the flesh and bones of anyone unlucky enough to get in the way of his kicks!  


Aside from improvements that focus on giving him a new level of **Engine** or extending his *Recipro Burst* time, there is also a lot of other ways that Tenya could use his Quirk to make himself more viable as a Hero. He could focus on control of his leg engines so that his agility and ability to change directions is much faster or to hone his ability to rocket jump with them much better. He could focus on other ways to attack while speeding around that don't involve kicking such as simply ramming into his opponent at a high speed (that armor would come in handy!), overclocking his engines and running circles around people or objects to cause miniature vortexes that could be used against opponents *or* in rescue operations to lift rubble away from civilians. Hell, if the mangaka wanted to be brutal enough, they could even have Iida use kicks that intentionally focus his blue hot **Engine** exhaust onto his opponents not unlike what we saw Endeavor do that one Nomu's head! All in all, I think my main point here is that there are still ways to make Iida's **Engine** a viable and powerful Quirk and he could definitely improve to become relevant again!  


* Improving his Physical Strength

I think another important way to help Tenya reach a higher level amongst his peers again is to have him focus purely on his physical abilities as well. As we can see, Iida appears to be in quite good shape already, so it only makes sense that he should put some more focus into learning general crimefighting skills like hand-to-hand combat! We have already seen that this is a viable alternative for a pro Hero with enough skill when their Quirk either isn't useful or usable in the moment. Eraser Head showed us just how good a normal guy can be if he knows how to fight all the way back in the USJ Arc and later on, Uraraka even gained some melee skills during her internship! Focusing on his physical skills could not only give Tenya a strength, stamina and speed boost without his Quirk, they would be useful for when he is in a cooldown phase and could supplement his high-speed combat very well, too. A kick coming at you at faster than eye speeds is scary enough, but if the man attached to that kick knows how to fight then a villain is in real trouble. Gran Torino is actually a good example of how speed and combat prowess gel well!  


* Improving his Battle IQ and Leadership

Finally, I think it would do a lot of good to show us Tenya improving on his intelligence in battle as well as his general leadership skills even further. While we have seen flashes of Iida being a natural leader, it would be great to really flesh this aspect of him out without neglecting his other Hero skills. He became the class President because he is a natural leader, but lately things seem to have shifted so that Deku and Bakugo are considered the two members of 1-A that inspire their classmates the most. While this makes sense to a degree for the protagonist and his primary rival, it seems to have shafted Tenya a bit when he was being set up to be the leadership-type even more than the powerhouse types like Deku, Bakugo or Todoroki. I think this aspect of his character needs to be spotlighted more along with his improvements as a fighter. And on the other side of the token, Tenya has always been portrayed as smart and it would do him a lot of good for that intelligence to be focused more on his in-battle intelligence and strategic ability. I don't expect him to be a tactical master like Deku had to become or a natural genius at combat evaluation like Bakugo, but making him a smart planner in battle along the lines of Mineta or Momo when she's confident would make him a lot more effective as a Hero as well!  

&amp;nbsp;

###Conclusion!

Okay, that was a bit more long-winded than I originally planned for my first post to this sub, but as Iida is probably my favorite character, I felt he deserved a thread like this... particularly with so many people seeming to lose interest in him or becoming frustrated with how little he's been used lately and how little progress he seems to have shown with regards to his Quirk when compared to the other top members of his class (Midoriya, Bakugo, Shoto, Kirishima, Tokoyami...)! Hopefully you enjoyed the read and I would love to hear any comments or feedback from others here regarding any points I made, ideas I didn't think of, things I have overlooked, things you disagree with or generally just your opinions on Iida Tenya and his potential as the series continues.

98y2m7,10,2018-08-20,[MF]Being pray for my student (Part 3),willstories,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/98y2m7/mfbeing_pray_for_my_student_part_3/,"It took me a while to come back here and share my memories. As always, I expect to know what you think about these events and I may even have the authorization to share a picture or two. I just came back from a visit to Brazil and thought about continue telling about the time I was preyed upon.

I left off with sweet Caroline visiting me at work on a Friday evening. So, the deal was that on Friday evenings from 6 to 9 p.m., a teacher would be available to help students with homework and doubts. It was a free thing, and we had to be there in case any students showed up, which means that 99% of the cases it was a paid 3 hours appointment to use your phone and browse the internet. On the boards of the school the schedule of teachers on homework duty was always available, so everyone would know that I was going to be the person there to help shape young minds to love this amazing language of ours (actually Brits’ language, but you got my point).

It was shaping up to be a very boring Friday night, where me and Eliza (the intern) would sit on a classroom and talk about random stuff. Don’t take me wrong, Eliza was this petit girl, that was a huge amount of fun (would be even more later), I loved spending time with her, but rain was pouring down outside, it was fucking damp and hot, and the last thing either of us would like to be doing was working that Friday evening.

At around seven when it seemed like we were going to be alone and were on the lounge watching Fresh Prince of Bel Air, Caroline showed up on this hippie style dress and roman sandals (very weather appropriate, I KNOW). She said that she was worried about the test that would be in two weeks and wanted to crack down early, usually Eliza would help students first, but I told her that since Caroline was my student and she was enjoying the show so much (I introduced her to Fresh Prince, young people don’t know what they are missing), I would help the student. Also, since the computers where on the lounge and I didn’t want to spoil her show, I would take the girl to the teachers’ office on the second floor and if she needed anything she could just call me on the intercom. Suspicious, one could say, but that is me, a giver, not surprising. Also, I made it sound as a favor to Eliza to which I was rewarded with a quick rib cracking hug. I AM SELFLESS.

I told Caroline that we could go up, and as a joke I said that she was not supposed to speak loudly, so not to wake the ghosts of the empty halls. (It was actually a legend around that the house was haunted by the ghost of a girl). But I just wanted to make sure she knew we were alone in the school. Suffice to say that she took on the hint and as we got to the second floor I was staring at her naked ass wiggling as she went up the stairs. As soon as we were out of sight she had started unhooking her dress and letting it slip down in the middle of the stairs, leaving it for me to pick it up. (Have I mentioned she was the most awesome minx?).

I was drooling on that awesome butt, and I could still see some of the bruises I had left behind in our encounter the previous week. She walked slowly towards the teachers’ room, making a show of each step, making me entranced to each movement of that derrière. We entered the room and while I closed the door, she sat on the teachers table, her feet on it and legs wide open. Not a thing to hide, but still what a tease.

“Like your surprise?” – She asked smiling.

“It came already unwrapped it seems.”

“Well I had to spend the whole week without sex thanks to all the bruises you left on my body, I didn’t want to waste much time to get a cock inside of me”

“Sorry, not sorry” – Was my answer with my trademark crooked smile.

Since she wanted a cock so much, me being such a caring and giving teacher, realized I should oblige and provide every inch of her desire in one swift motion. She was soaking wet when I approached her, so the whole process was easy, even though she was the tightest pussy I have ever fucked. I fucked her at that table for a long time, raw, animalistic and slightly irresponsible, but we loved each second of it. She buried her mouth on my shoulder to contain all her moans, when she finally came, she bit me to the point of drawing quite a lot of blood.

When she finally stopped trashing and spasming she released my shoulder and looked at with this sheepish smile, that arousing act of a good girl that she enjoyed putting on so much. When I touched my shoulder and felt the blood, it only enhanced my animalistic instincts and I redoubled my efforts, I grabbed her by the knees and waist and fucked her standing, in the middle of the teachers’ room, not really caring about the sounds of flesh meeting flesh and moaning and grunting that followed. When I finally came, I barely had time to put her back on the table before my own knees collapsed on a shattering orgasm.

She laughed and enjoyed while I tried to recover my breath, after a near asthma attack. She sat thereon the table, watching me with her legs wide open, idly playing with the cum dripping out of her. I couldn’t stop smiling between deep breaths, she was the hottest thing I ever encountered.

When I came down from the orgasm rush, it downed on me the risk of getting caught and I started worrying if there were any cameras around. (Great timing, I know). While she freshened up in the adjacent bathroom, I went into damage control. The room was reeking of sex, and if Eliza came up it would be impossible for her to miss, so I called her and said that she could go home at any moment she wished, that I would close up after Caroline finished all her exercises(If you know what I mean). I told Eliza that in the pace Carol was going we would have to sleep in there, and that she could go, and I would deal with the situation. Needless to say, Eliza was overjoyed (the very next day I got my favorite chocolate as reward for my kindness), she would just finish that episode and call me to warn me she was leaving.

When Caroline got back, I had opened the windows and was letting the moist air get inside, to mask the smell of DICK MEETS PUSSY in the room. We sat down and talked for a while, waiting for Eliza to leave. We actually talked a little about class and school before she told me she thought Eliza had a crush on me, I laughed it off and said it was not of her character, but there she planted the seed which would evolve into me fucking the intern.

I told her some of my other adventures and my preferences with all genders. And that is where we got to her telling me that she would love to see two men fucking, but her boyfriend was to much of a cunt to let her have that. So it happened that I could help her, since I had this thing going with a friend of mine that I knew she would die for. When I described and told about my friend Lionel, she started laughing uncontrollably and told me she already knew him and had the hots for him since they were kids, they had been to school together or something like that, she never thought he was into guys. There we had the beginning of a new plan, I just needed to talk with our friend.

Soon Eliza called to let me know she was leaving and when I heard the door close we were fucking again in a matter of seconds, we fucked all around the school, running naked and laughing. She rode me in the lounge couch, making a huge mess of dripping juices (thankfully a leather couch) from our combined orgasms. We were hot and exhausted when we left the school at about midnight. She (of course) had told her mother that she would be sleeping at her friend Alice, (after I learned that my contact was saved under Alice on her phone too, and weirdly as it may be, Alice is her baby daughter’s name) that lived near the school, so the next morning her mother wouldn’t need to take her to school.

That was the only night we slept together, it is oddly difficult to get students to sleepover, never understood why. We were spent, and we mostly cuddled naked in my bed, until I woke up with her in the middle of the night riding me slowly, until she orgasmed and went right back to sleep.

I hope you all enjoyed this memory, next time I will tell all about the way I got with Lionel for the first time. Stay tuned.

As always let me know what you think."

##How The Chart Works:

These charts are created based on how frequently each song appears in the top 10 songs/albums for all of the users signed up for the chart. If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurrence, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for the last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each.

Then I broke down in front of one of my best friends (who I wad also sleeping with, so he knows exactly what my body looks like), and told him that it was the most I had ever wanted to purge. After that he has been very observant about my eating, and gets upset with me if I'm not. 

Because of that, I've been doing really well at eating (other than the few purge sessions I've had), and have been maintain my weight. 

Then we decided to get evaluations from our work nutrition people, my appointment was on a Monday, his was the following Thursday. I had told him what my bf% was from my eval, and he made some speculations about what his was (mine was 21%, he guessed his was similar). Over the week we went out with some friends (all men, I'm the only woman there), and they started looking up bf% and speculating about what they were, and discussing the ideal bf for women... 

I was okay with all of it until my bestie, and one of the others started talking about the hot waitress, and how she must be 17% body fat (keep in mind, he knows mine). 

Then I got REAL bitchy and made some awful comments that he seemed upset by until we started walking to the next place and I tried to hang back, but he wouldn't let me and I freaked the fuck out on the street. I cried hysterically and, even though I told him that it had nothing to do with him (I'm v sensitive about people not thinking my Ed is their fault), he apologized for being so insensitive, and talking like that in front of me. 

After that, I kept being good because I was around him. 

But now I'm home. 

And I just ate a meal... And then I purged WAY more than I ever had before. I haven't even eaten much. Pre-purge I was 100% still in deficit. Now idk. I'm about to break up with my fiance, and my friends here don't know about my fiance or my ed, and I'm terrified of what's about to happen to me. But I'm also excited to lose weight, which is when scarier... 

Anyway, just needed to get this out there. Fuck my life. Hopefully I don't purge this beer."

I had two internships at the company previously, which is how I got offered for full time despite my actual major being much less software dev focused. My major issue is that I'm not super passionate about software engineering, but I took the job because obviously it was a great opportunity and wanted something lined up after college. In hindsight I wish I had thought more seriously about what I am interested in and passionate about. 

My university had a great HCI grad program where I met a few of the students and the faculty were amazing. They were always working on cool projects and since I was a freshman I was always really interested in the research around tech, society, and social justice. I would love to pursue a career where I get to engage with those kinds of topics every day instead and so I'm thinking of applying to grad school after a year or so working. But I'm worried my only experience being in undergrad research and software engineering won't be relevant or enough for hci programs. Has anyone transitioned from a working career in software engineering to HCI? Do you have tips or stories about your experience? "

I'm a senior executive at a company where you work as an IT analyst. I've been surfing the web at work, exploring femdom sites, looking for a chat partner or maybe even a playmate. Of course, I'm not supposed to be doing any of this at work. My posts are clear about what I'm curious about - generally milder things like light bondage, blindfolds, light punishment like spankings, and maybe being shared by a domme and her (female) friends. You check my history and you see I've chatted with a few people but nothing ever developed. You just happen to share some of the same interests so you set up a profile to reply to my posts anonymously. We set up a meeting and I arrive at your studio to find you dressed as a domme, with a mask and wig concealing your identity. It's only after I'm tied that you reveal who you are. I am blackmailed into becoming a client of yours, with our sessions becoming more intense and my limits tested over time.

2. As a variation, you're my secretary. I make the mistake of leaving my office to get a coffee without locking my screen, when you come in to leave some papers for me to sign. You see my screen, explore a bit, smile, note my user name and the site I'm on, and set up an account for yourself to arrange for us to meet.

3. I'm your older neighbor. A busy man, successful, but not too tech-savvy. You're the nice-looking young lady who lives in a condo down the hall. I know you work in IT, and I've asked you to help me configure a new home network. You get everything set up but I don't know that you also installed a back door to remotely monitor my activity. You discover my browsing history and decide to have some fun. The next time I'm surfing, I see a popup message: ""I know what you've been looking at"". I'm a bit concerned, but I close the message. A couple of days later, there's a knock at my door. I open it and see you standing there, and invite you in. All you say is those same seven words: ""I know what you've been looking at"". Then you add, ""I'm here to help you explore."" 

4. I'm a rich executive. You're a poor college student. We find each other on a site that specializes in matching up people in our situations. We meet, and agree to enter into a ""mutually beneficial"" relationship. Things go well, but after a few dates, I suggest trying something a bit different - tying you. You seem hesitant, so I say you can tie me instead if you're more comfortable with that. You still seem uncertain and tell me you'll think about it, but on the inside, you're smiling. When I arrive at your place for our next date, you answer the door dressed as a domme. You lead me to the spare bedroom in your apartment, which you have set up as your ""chamber"". 

5. I'm a senior manager at a large firm. You're an intern, assigned to my department one or two days per week as part of your college education. We start off with a civil, professional relationship, but after working together on a couple of projects we become more friendly and eventually we start flirting, joking about getting together after work and having fun, but nothing ever comes of it. I don't have any personal photos in my office and I don't wear a ring, so you have no way to know that I'm married and have been for some time. As an intern, you're invited to office functions like the Christmas party. You arrive a bit late, and see me with someone new, and discover that she's my wife. You manage to sneak away before I know you were even there. The next week, when we're flirting, you suggest we go to your place after work. I accept, not realizing you're serious, and just thinking it's part of the game. Eventually I make it over, and you tell me to relax in the living room while you change into something more comfortable. I hear you speaking as you walk down the hall, saying ""why didn't you tell me you were married?"" When you step into my field of vision, I see you dressed as a domme.

-----

If you're interested in seeing where any of these openings could lead, or if you have anything similar in mind, feel free to send me a message. I'm hoping we can turn this into an ongoing chat/role-playing relationship. I am not going to share voice, pictures or camera, and I won't expect you to either.

My name is Natalie, and I'll be your tour guide this evening."" Oh great, *Natalie* was here tonight. Not that she was bad or anything, quite the opposite. She just knew so much about the exhibits that the guests would be spending far more time than usual at each one. ""If you look over to your right, you'll see our first exhibit here, the disobedient maid."" There were a lot of *oohs* and *aahs* from the crowd, as well as the sound of pictures being taken. I couldn't see from my current position, but I knew it by heart. It was a woman wearing a sexy french maid outfit entirely made of latex, with her hands bound behind her back and a feather duster sticking out of her mouth. ""As you can see here,"" Natalie went on, ""Alice here has been very naughty lately."" It was bullshit. It was just the shift she'd been asked to work. And honestly, she wasn't even the one that drew the short straw. ""Alice is stuck in this enclosure until she dusts off every single item in that room."" Typically there was a full bookshelf, a table with some ornaments, and a leather chair. A couple of times per evening the maid would ""accidentally"" knock over a chalice or decoration from the table, though sometimes it was deliberate. The crowd loved it anyway, looking on from the other side of the giant glass window.

Sure enough, Natalie spent ages answering stupid questions from the guests. Honestly, I just wanted them to move on. Eventually she did, although the next part was just as bad. ""Moving on, exhibit B here is known as the playpen."" I still couldn't see them, but I could hear the squeak of rubber and their (partially) exaggerated pants. There would be two girls in there, trussed up in latex bitchsuits that kept them down on all fours. I wasn't sure who it was tonight, but I knew they were both wearing ring gags that kept their tongues hanging out. Once again, the crowd cheered and took plenty of pictures. I knew the only exposed bits were their pussies and their tits, so their mouths would be busy tonight. The biggest variable was whether or not they were blindfolded or if someone had been given a strapon. Once again, Natalie took her sweet time speaking with all of the guests.

""Finally, we have the last exhibit in our tour tonight. And this one's a rather special one."" I gulped. I had been waiting for this for a while now, but I was still nervous. Not that there was much I could do anyway. ""Exhibit C, also called the decoration, is a personal favourite of mine."" That part was actually true. While Natalie spent plenty of time at all the Exhibits, this was one where she always got personal. ""Yes, there is actually a woman inside underneath all that."" I couldn't see the crowd, but I could feel them staring up at the wall. I was fully encased in a vacuum sealed latex prison, unable to move a muscle. My outline could be clearly seen by anyone. Despite the fact that my face was fully covered, I had a ball gag and blindfold underneath my bondage. ""As you can see here, this is one of our interactive exhibits."" Natalie pressed a button, and the dildo in my cunt started slowly vibrating. I screamed into my gag and writhed in place, much to the amusement of the crowd. My buttplug stayed still, so she must be saving that one for later. ""Don't worry,"" she told the crowd, ""you'll all get a chance to use the remote. Also, unlike the last ones, this is a hands on exhibit. You're welcome to get up there and feel any part you like."" I let out a groan at this point, both from pleasure and annoyance. It was going to be a long night.

I never should've taken an internship at the fetish festival.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hi everyone, thanks for reading through that massive wall of text. As you can tell, I'm looking to be a toy for others to play with tonight. If you want I can be in one of the other exhibits, or if you have any new ideas, please let me know! You're welcome to be the tour guide, the people in the crowd, or the manager coming down to see how things are. Who knows, maybe you can be another attraction that gets to interact with the other exhibits?

If your a fan of latex, hard bondage, public, and orgasm control, send me a message. My limits are incest, scat, beast, and underage. Pretty much everything else is on the table. I look forward to getting some orange envelopes."

I have job offers from two different companies and in total dilemma to choose one.  


***The First Company:***  
I have been doing Internship at this company for a month now. The job, environment, friends are really cool. I have few of my close friends working here. The company provide a starting base salary of 3000$ per month. Also, the company is international and has branch on many different countries., so I could have good profile working here. The work culture is excellent. But, the work here is related to Quality Assurance of Software Product. I do more prefer the programming stuffs, so I find working here as an average ( neither interesting nor boring).  


***The Second Company:***  
This is a startup from an ex-employee of the first company. He has been helping me in learning many things related to IT and Programming. The base salary here is about 1500$ per month. As I said it is a startup, so I will lack many facilities and good friends that I could have in the first one. But the job here is interesting. I have to do programming and I love it. I am sure that working here will increase my skills more than working for the first company.  


The first company is the ideal one for most of my classmates. Only I was the one to be selected there as an Intern from my college. For salary, I want the first one. But for work, I want the second :D

Coming home after 2 months has been so strange. I was just screamed at for the first time in two months, and I have so many memories flooding back.

I remember sobbing into my pillow, desperately trying to mask the sound because I knew my parents would be angry if they heard me crying.

I remember wearing the same four shirts over and over again to school, year after year, even though my parents pull in six figures. I realized that's probably why I got to college and started buying new clothes on a weekly basis, stuff I don't even really need. 

I remember the disassociation. I'd forgotten about that, completely removing myself from my body when I feel tense around them.

I forgot about my ndads constant need to be praised. It feels so strange to constantly having to be complimenting him and feeding into his ego as he searches for validation.

I forgot about my parents extreme mood swings -- one minute, my dad will be trying to give me wisdom on how he learned to live a good life (lol), the next he'll be yelling and threatening me.

I don't like being home. I wish I did. "

990w48,0,2018-08-21,Can I(23) get perspective on a situation with an old fling(20)?,EmilyB115,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/990w48/can_i23_get_perspective_on_a_situation_with_an/,"Tomorrow I'm moving to the same city as a guy I had a little two week fling with a few months ago. When we ended I'd get drunk and call him. Happened three times. But we worked together for a full month after the final time and thought we were good. We pretty quickly we both moved on and had stuff with other people. Anyway he's back together with his ex from before me and he deleted me along with the next girl he had a thing with off facebook.

I always felt bad about how it ended. I criticized him a few times at work. In the end I almost think he was trying to hook up again before I left. Even said he was thinking of signing up to the same set I'd been placed on. Had there not been so much drama between us I would have done it but honestly I was sick of everything and hooked up with an extra for a few days instead.  I told him I was coming out for work for a few weeks for a film project and I wouldn't mind hanging out as friends. I said he was funny (he's a comedy writer) and I was overall friendly and nice. I also said I wished I would have worded something differently in one of our fights and just explained that. I was concerned he'd think i'm re-hashing the past.....maybe I was but it was honestly just me kinda rewording something I felt was harsh and a little mean (if not deserved) which I carried guilt about. I was very non-accusatory. Said we were both in a bad head-space and i think we'd get on as friends on a different less stressful set. Then he BLOCKED me. So what does this mean then? Why not just say ""no I don't think we should hang out"". This is very hostile and vengeful. Tbh I almost think he hooked up with the girl after me as vengeance. Which is stupid cuz he ended it with me and I made it clear I was unhappy about it (via my 3 embarrassing drunk calls) even if I did move on rather quickly. I told him we didn't even have an emotional relationship anyway cuz he drinks too much and it almost seem like he was trying to make it look like he was having a connection with this girl so he could prove the problem was me not him/his drinking, but whatever.   


He had ended it because I was supposed to go to LA and he figured the fling wasn't going to last. I didn't end up going to LA and I stayed here so really there was no problem. And then Id think maybe he was into me again and I'd wreck things with my drunk calls as I didn't think things were progressing fast enough (stupid, yes). He did embarrassing shit which I called him out on. (Got shitfaced and hit on an intern who had been flirting with him - as she does everyone- and she reported him as she didn't want to sleep with him). I didn't get emotional nor fight with him at all of our last month on that job though and we were both with other people.

Please don't write stuff like ""he's an ex! Just move on"". Maybe I do have some residual feelings there, but I've kept them in check and have actively been seeing other ppl and he knows this. I simply want to know if I'm doing something to bring this on. Is this me or him? It's a really extreme reaction to saying he is welcome to come hang out with my friends and I at a casting party and I'd like to be friends. I had meant it to be positive and peacemaking. Also we haven't' spoken in over three months so this isn't a situation where I've been drunk calling for the past month. Am i doing the wrong thing? Was bringing up the past even in a nice way a HUGE mistake? Can I change here so I know better for next time? I simply don't understand why he couldn't say, ""I don't think we can be friends and I don't want to talk about it."" It's like he wanted me to hurt or wanted to show me he's angry but I dunno what for? I'm barely an ex but have you ever had an ex try to be friendly and even include you in an event and you reacted this way?   


\*TL;DR\* Reached out to an old fling who is with someone else. Said I'm moving to town for a project and asked if he wanted to come to a casting party as friends since it's been a few months and we are on a less insane project where emotions aren't running high. He BLOCKED me. Which i thought was extreme. How can I change my approach? Have you ever reacted this way and why?"
990x3v,1,2018-08-21,I don't know how I feel...,yerboiboba,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/990x3v/i_dont_know_how_i_feel/,"I want to preface this with saying I genuinely don't know if I have clinical depression or not, and I don't want to jump the gun or accidentally place myself in a category that doesn't actually concern me. What I mean to say is I don't know if I'm actually depressed or am just going through a rough patch in life that's all in all gonna be pretty short. I haven't seen a doctor about it, and I am super hesitant to do so because I don't want my parents to talk to me about it either (more on that later). So, if you're willing, I'm gonna kind of rant and just get what I do know off my chest, trying to be as honest with myself as I am with you and not holding back any truth or twisting the truth to fit what I want to appear to be. Sorry for the long post in advance.

Where I stand right now mentally is all very confusing. One day I'll wake up after a fantastic night's sleep, ready to play some video games for a few hours, grab some lunch, and bang out a quick work day with ease. The next day, I barely sleep, I wake up groggy, I don't get out of bed for another 2 hours because I don't feel the desire to do anything but continue to lie down, not even get up to enjoy my only main hobby, video games. Other days, even when not on a day off, I'll be able to continuously fall back asleep for upwards of 12 hours because I start to wake up, realize I am, and then decide it's just not worth opening my eyes today. That eventually results in me sleeping too much and then being super tired and slow the rest of the day, not wanting to do anything that involves more effort than the bare minimum.

Then there's my attitude towards my job and my career. Regardless of good/bad day, I just have a constant feeling of failure every day I go to work. I came out of high school, barely squeaking by with a pass and enough credits to get into a community college, only to take one semester and, as far as I'm currently concerned, abandon my dreams of becoming a photojournalist. Now, I'm kinda stuck in a below-minimum-wage job as a delivery driver with co-workers only one of which I care to see, and barely have a plan to save up to move out by next summer. Now, I've fantasized about trying to find an internship or something else on the side to continue my search for my dream job, but every time I actually build up the motivation to do some research, I determine it's not worth the trouble and accept my current state as the only state I can be in.

Thirdly, I can't stand to be in my parent's house anymore. You would think that would motivate me to work harder and plan better to make sure the move out is as smooth as possible, right? Wrong. It's just a constant reminder every day I wake up that I failed to stick with college and eventually move out into a 2 year university after community college classes like a lot of people I know. Waking up and hearing my siblings running around and having to talk to my parents about my schedule and when I'll be home for dinner that week just puts a damper on my drive to obtain independence. 

So after reflecting on all of this for the past few months, I felt something that could help me get out of the ordinary, dull routine would be to find a girlfriend. Now, I'm not the greatest looking guy, but I'd say I have enough self esteem left to put myself out there and see if any of the many fish in the sea would bite. Now, my methods may not be the best, because my main strategy is Tinder. I know that it's an app for attention seekers and hook ups, but I just can't convince myself to spend money on an actually dating service, or hell, a professional matchmaker if I'm that desperate. So in that case I'm stuck with Tinder, and as of yet, I'm not getting much. A match here and there, a brief conversation, then I scare them off by being too cautious and asking too many questions. Did I mention I'm super self conscious of how I talk to people to make sure I don't offend anyone or make them think I'm weird? Well guess what, that seems to backfire every time as well. I just don't feel like I'll ever meet anyone, not just because I'm using the wrong service for what I'm looking for, but also because I literally never go out during my free time, giving me any opportunity to meet someone irl. 

If you're still reading, the point I'm trying to make is I'm a super antisocial pessimist with no drive to make myself happier, and I can't determine if I'm actually suffering from depression or just digging myself deeper into a hole of bad habits and routine. Maybe both. But in either case, I just don't see a point in doing anything anymore. I don't even enjoy my hobbies, I can't concentrate on anything as simple as some TV, and my job just seems to be getting more stressful as I plan for my future that doesn't seem to exist. So why don't I see a doctor to determine what's really going on in my head? I'm still on my parent's health insurance, and I'm afraid if I make a visit on my own terms, it'll raise some eyebrows as to what I could possibly be going through to make an appointment without telling them. And I don't want to say anything I've just typed out to them in any amount. And here I am at 3 in the morning ranting on how much I think my life sucks, when in reality I've probably got it good. I have a few friends (or used to be at least) that ACTUALLY had clinical depression they took medication for, and I'd feel horrible if I learn I'm just being a pessimistic asshole to myself thinking I had what they had. 

So that's that I guess. Bet you I derailed my own thought process throughout that entire thing, but I hope at least some of it makes sense if anyone is even reading this.

Tl;dr- Am I depressed? Who the fuck actually knows. I'm just an asshole I guess..."

I'm an incoming 3rd year transfer with all my pre-reqs completed for the Econ major (calc 2, stat 2, intro macro/micro).


To declare the Econ major in time, all I need to do this Fall is take two Econ courses. One of which NEEDS to be intermediate Micro. (3010, or 3110 - idc). 


Here's the issue - not a single intermediate micro class is available. I can't even add myself to the waitlists for these courses, it's literally not even giving me a button to enroll or add to my cart.. this is the 5th and last class I need to enroll in, but I can't seem to even get on a waitlist. 


Is there anything I can do? This course is extremely important for this Fall, because the courses I need to take in the Spring to graduate on time require this. (summer term is NOT an option, have a summer internship lined up for 2019)

I had an internship with a news station last summer (I’m a reporter) and my old editor texted me last week about applying for a job there. I told her I wouldn’t be able to because I accepted a different internship for my final semester (woot) but I’d still like to catch up. 

Fast forward 3 days and I’m in her city having beers with her and some other colleagues. One thing leads to another and I’m back at her place to “watch West World.” Keep in mind, she’s almost 30, no boyfriend, no kids, nada. The entire night I was getting all the signals that I had a vague feeling about while I was still interning for her last summer. 

We hooked up. Which normally I’d be patting myself on the back for since I have that “hot for teacher” thing, but she texted me early the next morning (I didn’t stay over) saying that she was recently put on a new, non-narcotic pain medication and that it made her way more intoxicated than she expected. She apologized, told me she’s “undoubtedly 100% straight,” and that she would still like to be friends. For the record, there was no way for me to tell she was that far gone; I wouldn’t have followed through on anything had I of known. 

I don’t have romantic feelings for her or anything, and I truly want to maintain a friendship since we have a lot in common that I haven’t found with many people. 

Should I ask her to meet up for coffee or anything? Or how should I approach this? "

As the title states I'm looking for a rp/chat partner for the long term. Whether we find one setup that we play out in a long series of scenes or we bounce around to play out all kinds of debauchery, they both have advantages. I'm looking for someone that I've got chemistry with so that we can have some filthy fun for a while to come.

A bit about what I'm looking for. Scene/world building. Don't get me wrong it's gonna be dirty and nasty, but I love a good build-up. Dirty talking. This is almost a must. Humiliation/degradation/training, not mandatory, but it's something I enjoy greatly. Good girl gone bad, innocent girl going dirty, powerful woman brought under control are some of my favorite types of scenes. Everything else is possible as well, to include incest, ageplay, raceplay, noncon, dubcon, and whatever else we agree upon.

Now how do we go about it? The easy answer... however we want. More specific you say? Sure.

Fantasy. Whether it be high fantasy with magic and warriors and elves and whatnot or more historical there are some great options here. I love to take a combat or thief angle here, but there are a lot of possibilities.

Scifi. So let's go the other direction. Cybernetics/genetic engancements, aliens, and space pirates oh my. Star wars, Mass effect, Firefly, and most of all Farscape. If you know and can play Farscape you have my full attention. Love that show.

Modern. Family, neighbors, teachers, babysitters, random woman in the park, secretary, boss, intern, Free use, celebrity, and whatever we can figure out. I could list out possibilities forever, but you get the idea.

Rule 34. Comics or comic based shows/movies. Check. Anime. Check. Cartoons. Check. What weird ass rule 34 fantasy can we come up with? Weird is good by the way.

You probably realize I care more about the scene being fun and nasty than the specific scene, but I do enjoy that build-up and creation. Whether it be humorous or serious let's expand our boundaries and explore the depths of our depravity. If you've read this far I appreciate it and there are free pancakes to be had.

I have 3 options and wanted to know what seems most logical for those who have walked this road before me.

1. Stay at my paid internship with a local hospital, work about 10 hours a week after my classes, they have agreed to keep me until January. But it's location is downtown, so I would be fighting rush hour traffic, time is the concern here.

2. Take a much lower paying on campus position, working the same amount of hours after school as a study hall monitor for the athletic department, time and pay are the concern here.

3. Focus only on school during the week and get a server a job, or any job really, for the weekends.

My program has recommended we be available 7am to 5pm Monday thru Friday, but second years have told me you can get away with working as long as you don't miss class for it."

I am still on the hunt to do a literate fandom romance rp. Below are a few plot ideas, but I'm open to any you may have! (Note: These are Canon x OC, with you playing the canon role)

New Royal Crush (M x F or M x M)

Bowser x OC Bowser grew tired of chasing Princess Peach. He knew she didn't feel the same way he did. So he decided to pursue a new person...

This can be kidnapping, or maybe Bowser shows a sweet side. Up to you!

Not for Long (M x M)

Wallace Wells x OC (Scott Pilgrim Rp) When Scott brings over his new friend from work, Wallace outs on his usual moves. His best friend telling him the cute boy is straight won't stop him...

The Lab Intern (M x F or M x M) Professor Birch x OC (Pokemon) When Professor Birch was told he would get a new intern, he wasn't expecting someone so cute. As his feelings grow by the day, what will he do?

SHE/HE'S MINE! (M x F or M x M) BTR guys x OC (Big Time Rush) After a new up and coming artist moves into the Palm Woods, the guys go crazy for them (except for Kendall). Who will this new artist choose?

This is a love rivalry plot.

New to the Force (M x M) The Ginyu Force x OC (Dragon Ball Z) After Guildo left, the Ginyu force hired a new member- but weren't expecting someone so adorable and begin fighting over him. What will he do?

This is a love rivalry plot.

Game on, dude! (M x F or M x M) Bastion, Chumley and Hassleberry x OC (Yugioh GX) After a new student moved to Duel Academy, the guys couldn't resist them. Who will the newbie go for?

I will play pretty much all other characters in this, and it's a love rivalry.

Colors (M x M) Beast Boy x OC (Teen Titans) Beast Boy never thought he would love again. Until a cute boy joined their team... Wait, did he like guys? How will he deal with his feelings as they grow stronger?

Moving on (M x F or M x M) Tom x OC (Star vs the forces of evil After getting dumped by Star for Marco, Tom never thought he'd love again... Until someone new comes into his sights...

If none of these strike your fancy, feel free to give me your ideas/fandoms! Other fandoms I enjoy but don't have a specific plot for: Adventure Time, Avatar the last airbender, Disney, Inuyasha, Left 4 Dead, Legend of Korra, Total Drama

⭐⭐ Here are my rules:

1. Please be literate. No text talk or bad grammar (minus the occasional slip up of course).

2. I only rp in 3rd person. This is non-negotiable. Please be okay doing 3rd.

3. I ONLY PLAY UKE/SUB, NEVER DOM!!!! MY CHARACTERS ARE SUBS ONLY!!!! You have been warned!!!!

4. Be okay with OC x canon

5. Please be an active role player overall. We all have lives but please don't just disappear for days on end and never return.

6. If you are looking for all smut, you have come to the wrong place. I am fine with a build up to smut, but I want there to be a focus on romance and plot.

7. Please be respectful of me. I am a very friendly person but the quickest way to end an rp with me is to treat me badly. I am a human that deserves dignity like everyone else. Insult me once and it's over.

8. I'm sorry, but if your profile pic has a real person in it, I would ask that you change it before rping. It really just throws me off as weird as that sounds (anime/cartoon pics, scenery and anything else really are fine).

9. I usually do written bios, but if you HAVE to have pictures, I only do anime/cartoon refs and will only accept the same. NO REAL LIFE PICS PLEASE!!!

I am fine with people of all gender expressions, as long as you play M! My timezone is EST US time. All characters will be 18+.

I will be busy going between class and work today, so if I don't reply right away, I will get back to you as soon as humanly possible. 

I think that's it? If interested, kik:

Hope to rp soon!

I am looking for an internship this Fall and haven’t seen a post like this here. I’ll touch on what I am looking for, but also feel free to comment if you’re looking for (or know of any) other internship opportunities that are not relevant to me. 


About me

I am a senior at U of M finishing up my BS in Computer Science. This Fall is my last semester and I am only taking class part time. I am looking for full-time work (I don’t have class until 4:30p) but 30+ hrs/wk could work too. 

If you know of anything in IT, that would be great. Aside from that I am interested in roles pertaining to Business Analysis, content management, project management, consulting, business development, social media/marketing. I enjoy being supportive, creative, analytical, and solving problems. I’m open to a wide range of opportunities and I’m not picky about the size of the business.


Lastly, I am aware of platforms such as Indeed, and have been looking through these as well. I am not expecting links to job postings on these sites, but intended on this being more of a word-of-mouth type of approach. It would be great if more businesses around here considered hiring intern(s)!


Please feel free to comment or PM me if you have any questions. Thanks for your time, and an upvote for visibility would be appreciated :)

I wanted to make a post to say both thanks for helping me with the cup and iud question, and I want to give a hot-off-the-press update with my procedure.

TL;DR:

* Make adequate time for recovery.
* Get someone to drive you.
* Don't be afraid to say you're not feeling well. You're in a hospital / medical practice, two of the best places to be if you're feeling unwell. People are there to help you.
* Don't be surprised if you gotta poop.

The appointment for the insertion was today, 10:00 am Central. I was a little nervous but excited. I did all that I was supposed to do before coming in: take the two prescribed pills, some ibuprofen, and eat breakfast. When I got into the exam room I started to get a headache, a bit emotional, and a bit lonely. (This, I'm pretty sure, won't happen to anyone getting any sort of BC-related procedure. I just wanted some comfort from a pal while waiting.) By the time the doctor came in I felt okay.

The insertion hurt. Like, give me 100 pap smears in a row instead of this. I tensed up a lot when the doctor was conducting the insertion, so I'm sure that contributed to my pain. She said this procedure takes less time than it did with me - again, probably because I wasn't very relaxed But when the IUD was in and she took all the little tools out, my cervix felt fine and everything else was okay too.

But then the suckiness started.

My doctor was talking about light-headedness and having me put my pants back on as she walked out the door. I felt like my period just started while being on the flu, and I didn't leave the room for a while. I was sweating, feeling hot, wanting to cry and just not leave the exam table. Personally, I haven't experienced this bad of a cramp since I was a teen, and I remember that day so well because of how pained and bitchy I was. I MANAGED to get to the front desk and make my 6 week check-up appointment. When I was talking, I started to lose my hearing and my sight was beginning to dim. This was only over a period of a few seconds. The front desk attendants asked if I was feeling okay and if I wanted to see a nurse. I was not feeling the least bit human, so I told them I would ask for a nurse after using the bathroom.

Idk about you all, but I forgot that when I get crampy, I really, really, really have the need to take a #2. This didn't happen so much when I was on the pill. Even when I was getting the Paragard inserted I had to really go! I've done so much reading about IUD procedures and not once did I see anything about people needing to poop. So here I am with this PSA: Know where the bathroom is and don't be afraid of dislodging your IUD while doing your business. Yes, it can happen, and don't worry too much over that.  


I had a nurse approach me while I was in the bathroom. I felt much better after relieving myself, like, I totally wasn't just near death for the past half hour, but I still stayed in the waiting room for a few minutes. She gave me water and pretzels and was checking up on me here and there. This probably would not have happened if I had someone drive me. The two people I had in mind are unavailable. While my dad could have helped, I really didn't want to take him away from his work. So, smack on the back of my wrist for that aspect.   


Once I felt better I drove home. I called off from my internship since I wrote an email the week before saying I would come in for at least half of my scheduled time. I'm chillin on the couch, ate my pretzels, and am doing well. I invested in some cloth pads, so I guess I'm putting them to the test. I'll be taking Netflix / Hulu recommendations!"

I'm a young and relatively experienced developer that is having trouble finding a developer job here in Cincinnati. My situation is this: while I do have some professional experience (one internship and almost 2 years at a local company that I resigned at a while ago) I do not have my degree yet as I cannot afford to finish it up and cannot get a Fasfa because my age classifies me as a dependent and I cannot obtain my parents tax information.

I'm looking to fill an entry level or junior level role as a Web Developer, either front end or back end using things such as JavaScript, React, Redux, PHP, Coldfusion, SQL, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. I don't know if I'm looking in the wrong places to try to find a job or if it's the lack of degree that is making me have a rough time finding a position, so that's why I'm coming here.

I'm really looking to try and make something of myself. I want a full-time job where I can comfortably take off around 5-6 pm most days so that I can take part time classes at NKU during the night and online to eventually finish up my degree.

So far, I have had a lot of phone screenings and a couple interviews, one with a place out of state and another with a place in Cincinnati that is a contracting firm but seemed unpromising. The contracting firm essentially sends out emails whenever a job description lightly fits your profile and you need to rush to respond to the email to tell them you are interested, which just seemed really bad to me.

  
I'm really looking for some help here trying to find resources to get a job in the web development field as it is what I am extremely interested in and self-study almost every day. I need to find a company that is willing to take in young talent and put me to work. I recently have kicked myself in the ass and gone into hyper-mode just trying to find a position somewhere and I need a company that is looking for a dedicated and highly motivated individual to become a part of their team. I am facing hard-times ahead if I cannot find something to support myself and want to buckle down and get in the game.

As a note, I am more wary of talent agencies. I get phone calls and messages on LinkedIn all the time and they almost never have a position available like they introduce themselves as having, so if you're a recruiter I would appreciate it if you could do me the favor of not coming to me in vain, as that has happened quiet frequently as of late.

What are my options? Where should I be looking? Are there any hiring managers here on Reddit that would like to talk with me? If you have any information or would like to talk privately, please feel free to PM me and I can give you my phone number and/or email address so that we can talk further."

I'm currently in California for an internship until December. 

The repair was quoted at around $1200. But I'm weary to fix it because the car isnt worth that much along with other persistent issues (anti-theft causing it to not start, potential torque converter issue, air-conditioning going in and out) - plus the fact I'll have to miss work while it's being repaired.

The problem is that I don't really have a lot of money saved up to buy cash third party, plus my license isn't in California and I've never bought a car before. I guess i could finance a cheap used car but i'm not sure what the best option is. I also don't have any way to get out and shop around for cars. The other point is that i don't want to drive a new car back to the east coast when my internship is done - was hoping hoping just to sell/junk the Malibu.

What do you guys think I should do?

Any advice would be very much appreciated

I (26F) haven't posted before but I just didn't know where else to turn. I have a grandmother who I am VLC with due to her narc personality. I fell into her trap for a few years where she manipulated me and turned me against my parents, a relationship I am still trying to repair to this day. I wiggled free and realized what was going on and up until now have been fine.

I'm moving soon. Like, a pretty big move. Like no less than 6 hours drive away kind of move. I'm excited, I am a late bloomer who is moving in with my LDR SO (25M) for the first time- the only time I've left home save a year I floated back and forth between home and an out of state internship. It's a pretty big deal as I'm my parent's oldest, the oldest grandchild on my mom's side, and only the 2nd person in the family to move farther than an hour away that ha nothing to do with a military spouse. 

It's also stressful as the move is barely a month and a week away at this point and has happened pretty fast. Within a month of deciding to live together and starting our search, we found a fantastic apartment in his hometown that will put me closer to jobs that pay better for me (he live sin a suburb of a major city) and will allow him to stay at his current job till I find a place. We have enough saved, but I've just never done this so I'm not sure how to go about it. My mom had toyed with the idea of a huge party, but we settled on a small party (Family and maybe one or two friends) since I also have severe social anxiety.  All well and good. The problem is-This is also just a month after my cousin (30sF, This Grandma's oldest grandchild) past away very suddenly. Because of this,  gma has been trying to be more involved with myself and my sister.

 I'm not very receptive to it as her attempts are long overdue and they just aren't good attempts. Around the same time, I discovered a large ovarian cyst with torsion (Twisted 4x!!) that required a very unplanned surgery to remove my entire right ovary. Gma made no attempts to get in contact except through my father (her son), then sent a random jello cheesecake that was expired? My sister started school for a very specific trade, and her idea of supporting was immediately to ask her to do all sorts of things related to that trade for free- then getting upset when she DID agree to it that he wouldn't do it only on Gma's schedule which completely conflicted with Sister's. Those kind of tone deaf things. She's mostly harmless now. Nothing malicious any longer, but it used to be very malicious behavior which I can elaborate on if wanted.

This bring me to the above mentioned party: Yesterday morning at 3AM I received a very long text from her littered with emojis about how she was going to throw me a 'shower' so I could get things for the house. Never mind that she doesn't speak to any of the family I'd actually want, doesn't know my friends (or even have my real facebook to find them), and that I barely wanted the above stated family get together from Mom and aunts. I appreciate the thought but **I just don't trust Gma.**  I don't trust her to make the food, I don't trust her to not make it a wedding shower and mislead people, I don't trust her to keep it small as she already hinted at 50+ people. 

So I did what anyone would: I panicked. I sobbed and hyperventilated because I feel guilt. I'm her oldest living grandchild and I don't want to be around her. I don't want anything nice from her. I don't want it. She thankfully waited 12 hour for me to reply before pressing again so she's learning, but still. 

I finally politely told her my Mom had something planned, she could bring a dish if she wanted but it's small (I know, my spine is like al dente spaghetti) . She continued to push, I stood up a bit and politely pushed back, 'No this is already planned. I dont like parties and I already have too much to worry about with the move'. 

She conceded, but immediate tonal shift. She immediately sounded put out that I don't want her involved...and I can't help but keep feeling the guilt. While I don't want to be involved with her- I don't want her to feel lonely and unloved. I know I can't give her that love unless she fixes her behavior. But how can I turn off the guilt? I can't eat, I'm crying on and off and so stressed. All over telling her I didn't want her undoubtedly disastrous 'shower'. I hated that she tried to pull this stuff again. She used to do it all the time- she took over my first birthday allegedly (she's a total jsutnomil to my mom), she took over my first communion, my high school graduation, everything. She always tried to pretend to be my mom and replace her. 

But I still feel such intense guilt. I'm a people pleaser. I'm already feeling a fuckton of guilt over leaving my sister, so having another layer of guilt that my Gma may die at this rate thinking she was completely unloved and while I know she's hurting kills me. Cause she's not, as fucked as it is. I love her very much but she is not a healthy person to be around at all; but this guilt is driving me insane."

I am entering my senior year in a well-regarded business school in the Northeast as an Accounting major and Economics Minor. I wasn't sure about what I wanted to do going into university so I picked a path that I thought might open up possibilities down the road when I had a better idea of which direction to go in. The plan for the past year or two has been to go get a MACC and become a CPA, however, after two summers working in tax at a large national firm, I'm not so sure anymore.

I was looking at Baruch for a potential MACC and then came across this Quant program which seems like something I would be more interested in pursuing long-term. I have taught myself Python and am currently considering Codecademy's Data Science course which integrates Python, SQL, etc. and worked mostly using high-level Excel at both internships I've completed.

I know I could be successful in the program, with a 3.75 GPA (4.0 major/3.9 minor) and 660 GMAT as a Division 1 Student Athlete, but my only roadblock is whether or not I would be accepted into the program. I'm having difficulty finding info regarding their class profile and don't know how well I would stack up without extensive computer science/high-level calculus experience.

Thoughts on if I'm in over my head or not? Is a CS undergrad necessary? What else can I do to get a leg up when applying and preparing? Thank you!"

Big fan of this sub and it was a great resource when I was shopping for my first bike. Ended up with a Specialized road bike from a LBS and I absolutely love it. I started part-time law this Monday and ride from home to work to school. 

One issue that I've already found is that my current backpack isn't enough. I'm not really a fan of panniers considering that I like to go on long rides during the weekend and hate the idea of needing to do a small procedure just to remove the racks. 

I currently have a North Face backpack which is built to last (6 years old at this point), but it just doesn't fit enough. Now that I ride to school, at any given point I'm carrying 2-4 books, a notebook, my laptop, a spare change of clothes, a towel, and a quick wash kit because I like to workout before my evening class. 

Outside of taking my intern on my handlebars, does anyone have good recommendations on a backpack? Preferably a THICC backpack that can haul all my stuff? For the sake of taking inquires I'd say price is no issue at all. Thanks everyone!! "

Im 24 and I was let go from an office admin position as an executive assistant (bad chemistry with the boss) back in May and have been looking for work in a similar field (about 90 jobs applied to so far) since then. I'm currently working a part time job on a ""per-diem"" basis at Denver Airport but I want to quit soon as its laborious and i'm suffering from chronic back and foot pain as a result.

The problem is that I ether receive no response or make it as far as the final in-person interview seemingly having done well with HR only to receive a somber rejection email a few days later. Its funny because the jobs I do get called in for are ones I don't believe i'm that qualified but positions that seem tailored made for me I never hear back from.

I'm getting increasingly anxious as I am in the process of starting a business and I need substantial capital to keep it going to launch and my personal funds are running low. I live in Denver which supposedly has one of the strongest economies in the country but I can't find a job  with my qualifications which I find bizarre. I have over 4 years worth of office admin experience, a year long internship, i'm skilled in Microsoft Office including Excel, Google Apps, competent with data entry software and of course numerous skills i've learned from my own startup from writing a business plan to sourcing from foreign suppliers. However I do not have a college degree and some postings I know I could do well in but the deal breaker for many is a college degree. 

I rather avoid taking low wage retail or food service work as it wouldn't pay enough to be worth my time and the military isn't an option. 

I'm not scheduled to launch until late next year or early 2020 (product testing, brand awareness, fundraising etc takes time and money) however i'm beginning to think my startup experience may be seen as a liability rather than an asset as employers might not want to take on an employee who will probably leave within two years time and frankly they're right. The next position I land I have no intention of staying for the long haul but its my most valued experience I could offer.

If not office admin what jobs could I apply for with my qualifications? I can't delay the startup too long as I could lose valuable contacts and miss launch target but i'm running out time, money and hope. Will someone please hire me?!

Thank you for your time!"

Sorry for formatting and errors, I’m on mobile

So back story... I live in a popular vacation destination. I have buddies come up all the time to hit the lake or snowboard for the weekend. Last summer (July)my buddy brought a girl he was seeing and she brought a friend. I thought her friend was super cute and all of us including my 2 male roommates all hung out and hit the beach and floated the river over the weekend and had a blast. She mentioned to my roommates she had a boyfriend( that shares the same first name as me)at the time so I kept my distance on trying to hit on her. She goes to college close to my hometown 3 hours away and I go home every now and then to visit friends and family. 

Before she left I got her Snapchat user name and for a few weeks we would exchange snaps. 3 months later(October) I shoot my shot and ask her to hang out when I’m in town. Pick her up and ate some Acai bowls in a cafe near by her apartment and got to know her a little better. Dropped her off and she invited me to check out her apartment. Hung out for an hour and had to leave. Nothing physical happened

Continued to contact each other over Snapchat for a few months. Hung out again in February when I was in town and had a picnic on the beach with my dog and watched the sunset.  At the point I was still unsure if she was still with her boyfriend. I guess I’m too shy to ask about that stuff at this point. After we still Snapchat some texting and we have some snap streaks here and there, and best friends on Snapchat. 

Last time we hung out was in May, again in my hometown, we walked the boardwalk and then went out for a light dinner. Got to know her a lot better. Found out after she broke up with her long term boyfriend after she came back from my house last summer(problems they where having). She told me she would be going across the country for a summer internship. Had some light physical contact, hand on her lower back when walking. Lots of laughs and jokes. She suggested some dessert after dinner so we went to a local ice cream shop and took it back to her apartment to watch some tv. Nothing crazy happened and I was still too shy to make a move. 

We’ve still been snapping each other while she’s been out on this internship (best friends for 2+ months), occasionally text and now been FaceTiming each other 3 or 4 times a month for a few hours. We planned on going to a baseball game together in September when she is back. 

She’s super intelligent and laid back, but I’m not sure if I want a long distance relationship as I’ve been out of the dating game for a few years, but i would give it a shot with her. Or if I should try to keep it as a fling when I come home. 

I’m not sure if she sees me as a friend because of how slow I’ve been taking this, but she hasn’t clearly friend zoned me and I haven’t been clear about my intentions. I’m thinking if we go to the baseball game I try to make a move and/or at some point tell her I’m attracted to her and  ask her how she feels about me. What do you think?

I'm entering my junior year as a ChemE undergrad and am very interested in computational biology. I currently do research in this field, and hope to obtain my masters in it. I have a few questions.

What are the chances of a chemical engineering student getting into a bioinformatics/comp bio program with a 3.29 sophomore GPA with research and one internship?

Does anyone work in this field already?

Is the Masters degree worth it if I want to work at a Pharm/Biotech company?

What is the grad school application timeline like?

I did my BS in EECS and my MS in CS, focusing on AI/ML. Both degrees are from a top 2 UC (ambiguity for privacy reasons). I'm a good problem solver when it comes to CS problems but bad at interview-style implementation tasks. I freeze up and also forget a lot of things (have to search around every time I start a project because I forget how to do x,y,z in an efficient way). All my internship experience has been hardware design at Apple, Tesla, and some smaller projects. 

I've always done well in behavioral or case study based interviews. I took a look at cracking the PM interview and all of the estimation problems were cake.

I'm worried about coding interviews though. Can anyone who has gone through the full-time APM interview process shed some light on the intensity of the coding questions asked? I've heard it's not the focus but still comes up. Do you recommend HackerRank/Leetcode? What's the best plan of attack here?"

I(F20s) have been unhappy at my job for about a year and am actively looking for a new one.My employer has a yearlong internship program. Last year’s intern, Mandy (F early 20s), just finished up her time there. Mandy had a really bad experience at there because she was rarely given any work to do and basically ignored and not taken seriously the entire year. My boss, Kaylee (F20s, same age as me) is awful to work for, just like I expected when she became my boss after her promotion 6 months ago. She ignores us most of the time. She ignores most of our emails and she rarely shows up to her own meetings or will show up very late. Kaylee constantly claims she will do xyz to help us move our projects along, but then rarely follows through (and then we can’t move forward because we need her). She bogs my projects down so much that I sometimes just give up on them and she never asks me about them. She will sometimes even ignore an email I just sent and send me one asking me to do something for her (I’ll never get a response to the first email). Sometimes she will be gone for days at a time and not warn us or provide any explanation. She will also text me outside of work hours about nonemergency things.


She strung Mandy along, just like me, and did not give her much of anything meaningful to do the entire time (and our previous boss wasn’t much better before that, but at least she was nice about it and apologized about being too busy). Mandy and I often felt frustrated and disrespected by Kaylee. So we got to the end of Mandy’s year, and had nothing to show for her time there. Our interns are required to make notes for the next intern about how to do the job and I don’t know what she wrote in the notes, but it was so negative that the executive director had to step in an do damage control. Mandy didn’t have to deal with any of the fallout because she was gone by then. Afterwards I was at a meeting where it was brought up and Kaylee wanted to know if we understood why Mandy had been so unprofessional. I said something like “She had a hard time getting people to follow through with her on projects and she felt ignored”. Kaylee got really tense with me and blamed it ALL on Mandy, saying that Mandy refused to get work done the entire year. That was a blatant lie. I worked very closely with Mandy and she was a very hard worker who was eager to help. Yes, she had an attitude problem, but once I earned her respect, there was no issue.


I am really upset that Kaylee threw Mandy under the bus. I feel such a sense of injustice about what happened with Mandy that I can barely have any interactions with Kaylee without feeling overly angry inside. I don’t feel like it would be in my best interest to stir something up with my boss and I don’t even think I have the courage to. But now I’m worried that Kaylee is going to throw ME under the bus. I should also mention that multiple shorter-term interns we had in the past were supervised by Kaylee and had a very negative experience with her as well. There is no HR department. I am still pretty new to the professional world. I have no idea how to handle this and I want to be as professional as possible. Should I go and tell the Executive Director(she is my former boss and is the next person up the chain of command) what is going on? Should I wait until I find another job first?

**
TL;DR I feel like I should do something about it but I'm unsure of the most professional way to handle this.**"

Something dangerous and risky. I'm thinking of themes such as a spontaneous, maybe public, forceful or manipulative, involving a power dynamic, and maybe danger such as cheating or pregnancy risk type sexual activity. Definitely something we are not supposed to be doing. Something such as:

You have a summer internship with my company, and I am your boss. You are woefully unqualified and totally over your head. You lied on your resume and can't seem to be able to live up to your promised quality of work. It's clearly not working out, and you are not a good fit for the position at all. I'm afraid it would be best for everyone if we let you go. Until you close the door and talk me into letting you suck my cock. Well, I suppose I can let you stay on, at least for another week or two.

I'm the company VP known for getting what I want. I'm kind of a shithead in dealing with people, but I make the company money hand over fist so they pretty much do what I want. You are one of the office assistants that I have my eye on. Whether it's threatening your job or your health benefits, blackmailing your marriage, or threatening to report you to HR, one way or another I manipulate you into becoming my personal fuck toy. Don't bother going to HR, either. They aren't there to protect the employees, they protect the guys making the money, like me. Just get in my office, lift up your skirt, and bend over my chair. Don't bother locking the door, either. I like having people know I control you.

You are a legal secretary who is secretly the office whore. You are even better at keeping secrets than you are in bed. One of the junior counsel finds evidence of your misdeeds. I'm not known for my capacity for keeping secrets. I may need some persuasion to be convinced to keep quiet. I end up being a very good negotiator. After getting wind of your talents, I get you to agree to exchange a blowjob for my silence. Of course that leaves me in a position where I can easily blackmail you later. It isn't hard to use my leverage to get favors from you again in the future.

998szi,1,2018-08-21,Do Women Know What Friends Are?,WhatIsPlagiarism,MGTOW,https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/998szi/do_women_know_what_friends_are/,"Storytime: 

Both my sister and I played soccer growing up. We were pretty competitive, mind you this was middle school, but we both spent a lot of time with teammates. It wasnt just a sport, we had to communicate among ourselves and get along. My teams had few problems. If we didn't like someone in group, we just didn't talk. It didnt affect our playing. It didn't affect our lives. Some personal relationships don't work and that's fine, it's a fact of life. But we got over it.

My sister's teams were completely different. Each team had clicks within clicks and drama over who was destined for the cute cashier at the McDonalds over by the soccer field that they might play away at four times per year. Clicks break apart, things get petty, Nicki wont pass to Charlotte because she looked at the cashier for too long, and the team drastically suffers at different periods throughout the season. Things get worse before they get  better when shit hits the fan after the games. People choose sides and clicks reform so that Nicki and Charlotte aren't in the same group any longer.

And the result is that my sister has NEVER had a single long term friend until at least after high school. Even then, they're all dudes. I've had a best friend since I was 6 months old. I'm 21. He's not a standalone though, it seems easier for me to get friends like this somehow.

Throughout highschool the same things kept happening. The difference was that people were dating now. For me, things were about the same. For my sister and her friends, it seemed that a girl that gets commited to a relationship leaves her group. Even if there wasn't bickering over a boy, the friend support group becomes unimportant once the girl becomes cuffed. The girl just abandoned the rest of her life to become dependent on the dude. Often this turned into a cycle. Once one relationship ends, there's a race to catch another dude before the chick gets too lonely.

As you might tell, I really pity the girls that find themselves in this situation. There's so much faith and hope put into the relationship in the beginning. But when the girl expects the same from the dude, it's just not resonable. That's not how relationships work. It's unfair to expect someone to completely drop their lives for you. Many people, dudes included, don't understand this (Seems like the ""niceguys"" mostly). People defined by a single relationship - in a personal sense, not a romantic one - become dry when the relationship gets dry, and then the relationship turns poisoness. Both parties are unsatisfied. We need a support crew in our lives.

Fast forward to recent memory, for which I am saltily writing this post.

I started an internship. Specifics mostly are not important. I was assigned a mentor and her job is to teach me how things are done, since much of what the group does is way over my head. Personally, we hit it off big time. We don't have a great deal in common, but somehow we understand each other. We met up way more often than necessary for work to eat or discuss what we were working on at the time, and things are great. I was just enjoying spending time together.

And that was the extent of the relationship. She had a long distance relationship throughout all of this, which I had known about, so I made no attempts to move anything along. I didn't want to either, we had what I would call a very close friendship.

Then, you guessed it, shit hits the fan. She had invited me over for dinner, something that had never happened before. We have a fine time, talk a lot, take a tour of the apartment, cook dinner, and then go our separate ways.

A few days later she's very distant. No interest in meeting up, which was very unusual in our timeline. I start asking for work help because I have literally no clue what I'm doing and she's not responding to shit. The next weekend I recieve an email from her about how I'm not getting the most out the internship and threatening how she would report poorly to our bossman if I didn't step up, audaciously citing such work as the things I was asking her to help with. The message is urgent and aggressive to a tone that was never present in any previous communication. I respond as distantly as possible for the records, should bossman ever look over what happened.

The next time we have a scheduled meet she apologizes. Apparently she and her boyfriend got into a fight. But what does that have to do with me? The result of all this is bossman now believes I've deteriorated drastically since all of this. All he has to go on is her word and my work, which I can't do without her feedback. There goes hope for a place in the group or a letter of recommendation. 

Again, why me? The only thing I can figure is the boyfriend was jealous that I was in the picture. She would've been forced to lash out to protect his interest, even at the cost of her closest material friend. But there's a thought I can't shake. What if she had feelings? What if the night at the apartment was a failure in her mind, that she was tired of long distance but realized I wouldn't be the one to take a step in the direction of cheating?

I apologize for the amount of drama in this post, this isnt r/dating_advice, but this thought just won't leave. What if she had no sense in her mind how to maintain a friendship to begin with? What if modern conditioning eliminates the possibility of having any kind of friends in the world? And all that matters is maintaining a romantic relationship to have someone to depend on and ask things from and abuse, if it felt right? And they'll stay for the brain chemicals. They'll stay for the sex.

Sorry for all the details, but I feel they are necessary. This sub does a great job at identifying the problem. But how do we change this cycle which leads people to create poisoness relationships? Simply go our own way? There are dudes that behave like this too. Basically r/niceguys in a nutshell.

All feedback is appreciated, please criticize supportingly."
998vjk,3,2018-08-21,"My girlfriend (22F) wants to get married (22M), but I don't want to.. what should I do?",SalamanderCakes,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/998vjk/my_girlfriend_22f_wants_to_get_married_22m_but_i/,"First time posting here. Hope I don't violate any rules.   


**A little bit of background:**   
Let's call her B.  B and I have known each other since high school (\~2009/10) and started dating in 2016 (during college). We've been long distancing for the majority of our time together since we're about 400 miles apart (both of us currently reside in the US, but she's a foreign national). We try to visit each other as much as possible during breaks. I'll drive down to her place or she'll try to visit me by taking the bus up. I've met her main and extended family during holidays like Thanksgiving and so forth. They seem to really like me.   


Now, onto the main topic.  Earlier this year, it dawned upon B that she's most likely gonna get screwed over after graduation because she's considered an international student.... this means she'll need to find an employer that will sponsor her for a work visa. She could also apply for her Master's degree to stay in the US, which she is considering. She's also talked to me about getting married so she can stay in the States (I'm a citizen). We've had that discussion on several occasions where I've mentioned that since I just started my new job, I want to focus on my career so marriage is not exactly a priority for me right now.   
In the end, those discussions just lead to her being depressed because she says it's like I'm abandoning her (or leaving her to fend for herself). Ever since B realized that her time is limited here, she's done research at her current university to see if she could find research opportunities with profs and the like, but to no avail. She's taken the GRE exam recently for her applications to Master's programs, but it seems like she's banking on getting married.  I say this because she says she studies hard and tries lots of things, but I think she gives up really easily. She's done job searching for maybe a few hours (or 1-2 days) max if I add up the times cumulatively (throughout the course of a week or two). I honestly spent a year and a half trying to find internships (to no avail) and full time positions while in school. I'm not sure if I'm overestimating my abilities and comparing myself to her in that regard or she's just not ""trying hard enough"". I know that last part is subjective to each person. I personally befriended international students while I was in college and they did sooooo much like joining a bunch of clubs even if they were unrelated to their major, so that they could be in some leadership position and become more diversified in knowledge and more. Every time I try to advise her, it's like I'm patronizing her. She becomes defensive when I try to help.  I've tried saying things in different ways but to no avail. I've heard others give her similar advice and she accepts it with open arms, but if I try to point it out she just becomes even more defensive towards me in that regard. I've watched my words and tone, but it doesn't really change the outcome.   
Another example is when she has free time she'll take the time to rest (understandably so); she usually works 2 jobs on campus and is still doing so in her last semester (currently). These 2 jobs approximate to 20 hrs/wk.  But, she'll eventually complain about how she can't find any job openings or about how she doesn't really feel like applying to universities... so forth.  I personally think she could spend her free time neck deep into researching about interested companies that sponsor, working on her resume more, etc.  
Lastly (backtracking a little here), sometimes I feel like I'm echoing my thoughts because we've had the same discussion about marriage on numerous occasions and it ends with her being depressed. We both love each other, but I don't want to get married right now knowing that the main point is for citizenship purposes. She claims that's not the only thing since we love each other; adding her moving in, cutting out the long distance, spending more time together etcccccc. Sure it's not the only thing, but knowing that it's the main reason doesn't exactly shift my opinion.. regardless, I really am just trying to focus on my new career atm. I wouldn't mind getting married in maybe \~3-5 years or so, but that currently doesn't sit well with her.  She's been probing at me indirectly for a while now about how nice it would be to not feel so unstable about her status or how nice it would be to move in with me (which I mentioned she could do). I forgot to mention that she's a bit religious in that she doesn't believe in moving in with someone unless they're married (Christian doctrine). Honestly the probing feels more like a guilt trip than anything else. Every time she brings up the probing, I try to awkwardly laugh it off. If anything, I'm just avoiding the marriage topic. I like where our relationship is right now, but she wants more.   


Sorry for the LONG read. It's more of a rant mixed with a call for help. What are your thoughts on this? What do you think I should do? Am I in the wrong for not wanting to get married (cuz it sure feels like it rn)?   


P.S. I'm looking into going to a counselor soon to seek some emotional advice. I'm not exactly the most direct person. Sometimes I can't say what I'm feeling because I don't know how to describe it. I'd consider myself somewhat emotionally inept. We've had arguments in the past where either I couldn't express myself properly and hurt her or I just can't explain what I'm thinking at times.

999gd8,20,2018-08-21,A small tribute to the lovely irony of the Mormon church's retention tactics,jackbuddhist,exmormon,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/999gd8/a_small_tribute_to_the_lovely_irony_of_the_mormon/,"So, ya know that thing Mormons do when they notice you're not showing up as much? 

Offer you the religious equivalent of an internship, usually. Something so you feel all nice and included and necessary. Maybe the idea is that if they could juuuuuust get you in those doors, the magical fuzzy spirit of the place will whisk you right back into TBMness. Or maybe it's that they know the Guilt &amp; Expectations button *really* works on Mormons. Either way.

Well, turns out, I owe a tiny debt of gratitude to my institute instructor freshman year of college: 

I'd stopped showing up to class as much. It was slowly dawning on me how much of a drag institute was on my very limited and very coveted time, combined with the fact that I would more-often-than-not leave class angry, guilty, and with some massive cognitive-dissonance headaches. 

So, I stopped going. Stopped dealing with the cognitive dissonance as often. The semester was picking up, work was busy, and I barely had time to sleep, let alone worry over ethereal ideas of doctrine in my free time. 

But then, Institute Instructor decided I needed an extra motivator to get my butt in that chair. He asked me for a simple favor -- if I would be the person to set up the ""opening ceremonies"" or whatever the fuck ya call that -- ya know, with the prayer and the hymn and then someone has to read a scripture and someone else... quotes a... prophet. [Something like that. I don't remember. Sweet freedom.] Anyway, I was nice and somehow still thought I ""should be"" going to institute, so I agreed. Which got me to class every day for the rest of the semester. 

Which, in the end, solidified my shelf crumbling (oxymoron? eh, it fits). Those institute classes were among the first places where I saw the manipulation tactics, the denial of any other perspectives; the age-old and not-well-worn apologetics for racism, misogyny, homophobia; the GAPING plot holes in Mormonism's history and doctrine. That, among other things, is what got me to the point where I resigned. Got me to the point where I am now -- jackbuddhist, enjoying the hell out of my Ex-mormon status.

So thanks, man. Helped me get there faster. "
999m17,4,2018-08-21,Honest Advice Request--Improving my Admission Chances,metamedidata,OMSA,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSA/comments/999m17/honest_advice_requestimproving_my_admission/,"Hey all, I'm hoping to get some informed opinions on my chances of getting into the OMSA program in Fall '19, and advice on increasing those chances.  I'm a research coordinator, and what got me seriously interested in analytics was a recent project where I grabbed a ton of data, and then saw how the guys at the university we sent it to were able to transform it into actionable results that directly improved patient care.  That really inspired me, and it seems like OMSA might be a rare sort of program someone like me could get a decent shot at a ""second chance"" of sorts, academically, if they're willing to bust their ass.

I'll try to hit on the most relevant background briefly:

* Didn't have a stellar undergrad; started out at 3.9-4.0 as an undecided for two years and then graduated at 2.8 with a BS in Psychology.  
* Had no trouble with math in high school, but struggled with calculus courses in college; I think that didn't have much to do with the actual material, since I've recently gone back to it with MOOCs and I feel confident learning it now.
* Improved myself post-grad, landed a research internship, then a job as as research coordinator at a highly ranked hospital.  Been doing that for 4 years--I think I could get some solid recommendation letters from MDs/PhDs I work with there.
* Taken some online courses for fun in computer science, averaging about a 3.5 GPA, and learned Python on my own, so I'm familiar with programming.

Assuming I ace the MM courses--what else can I do to improve my chances as much as possible, and what sort of shot can I realistically have?  I'll have to catch up on the math, and while I'm sure I could do it via MOOCs for free, seems like doing well in it in a certified, graded environment would be leagues better in my circumstances.  Haven't taken the GRE, but am very much open to doing that.  Also hoping I can apply what I learn in the MM to my job, and be able to talk about that in my SOP and be mentioned in the rec letters.  I'm aiming to apply for Fall '19.

Any honest feedback--and especially advice--is much appreciated.

999on6,1,2018-08-21,Ashamed of what I've done,xxxthrowaway666endme,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/999on6/ashamed_of_what_ive_done/,"As of right now, I'm actually doing pretty well, but the the thought of what I've done can't ever get out of my head.  
  
During the last school year, my depression worsened, and with that, I masturbated more frequently as a way to cope. Thing was, I did it in the dorm bathroom because my roommate told me to do it there and not in the room. At the end of the year, people caught on and started posting signs to not masturbate in the dorm bathroom.  
  
I was fucking ashamed of myself once I saw those signs. I realized I fucked up big time, and I took it as a sign that I needed to change as a person. I remember crying because I thought I would do better when I took a semester, and I actually got worse. I thought about killing myself or running away, because I was too much of a coward to face my problem. That point in my life was basically rock bottom.  
  
The thing was, I was headed for an internship that I knew I didn't deserve, but got in anyways because of a recommendation from a friend. However, I told myself, ""I don't deserve this internship because I'm a piece of shit, but I have it anyways, so I might as well run with what I got."" And I did. I made improvements to my life, made friends for once, and became happy for once in a long time.  
  
And I'm heading back to school again soon, and these thoughts of what I did are coming back. I want to truly do better and perform well in school. But I'm fucking scared that people will realize that it was me, and that I'm a piece of shit who doesn't deserve a second chance.  
  
On the one hand, I'm glad I saw those signs in the dorm because it was my wake up call to stop fucking around. But on the other hand, that event can be my entire undoing as well. I think I need to realize that I am doing a good job in improving myself, but at the same time, I deserve the shame I receive once people find out. People can forgive, but they won't forget."
999ouc,3,2018-08-21,Every time I feel like i'm getting it together I let my anxiety become debilitating again,gtgfast,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/999ouc/every_time_i_feel_like_im_getting_it_together_i/,"I just feel so stuck and don't know what to do.  Totally desperate.  

I have pretty severe GAD and depression, and over the years (and the last few years in particular) I've had a very hard time managing it and its affected my ability to do necessary daily activities in a major way.  For the last few years I haven't been able to hold a job/go to school for more than a couple months without having some sort of breakdown that lead to me leaving.  I'm very privileged to have family that helps me financially and encourages mental health treatment, if I didn't I'd probably be homeless, in prison, or dead.  

I've pretty much done it all at one point or another when it comes to mental health treatment (both inpatient and outpatient) but I was pretty much at my lowest point I've ever been early this year, (I had cut myself off from literally every relationship I had besides family and was very isolated, and had just left my third job in 6 months) so I decided to go to an outpatient program at a particular hospital that my therapist recommended that has a really good reputation for treating anxiety disorders in a more personalized way, so I decided to give it a shot since I didn't know what else to do.  It ended up being a really good decision because I found it incredibly helpful and felt like I learned a lot about managing my anxiety, and I did a lot of exposure therapy and got myself in the habit of actually doing anxiety provoking things instead of avoiding them (which is the biggest issue I have).  I had reconnected with a lot of old friends and also made some new ones through that experience.  I was in a better mindset than I had been in years.  

Shortly after I got out of that program I started working on a relatively short certification at a community college and I got through all of the coursework and even got pretty good grades.  For the first time in years I thought that maybe I can actually function like a normal human and get through day-to-day stuff.  But then this week I started a short internship for that certification.  Obviously was anxious about it but I felt like I was doing well and I wouldn't let things be debilitating this time.  Day 1 I was a nervous wreck but I got through the first half of the day and I thought things were going pretty well.  I was fairly awkward socially but I thought I was doing a good job with the work (considering it was my first day) and I got along with everyone okay.  I'm basically there to learn and gain experience and I was expecting and wanted constructive criticism in my work, and the person I worked with the first half of the day did a good job of giving criticism without being condescending or aggressive or anything like that.  But then the second half of the day I worked with someone else and she was mostly fine but she was a bit more harsh with her critique on how I was doing and it made it more difficult for me to focus, which made my performance even worse, which made me even more anxious.  I was like on the verge of a panic attack but I thought I could get through it until she straight up said how visibly nervous I looked and that I needed to ""not be so nervous"" because it was negatively impacting the patients/customers.  I pretty much just shut down inside at that point and every instinct I had was just telling me I needed to get out of there even though I knew that I couldn't do that without ruining everything I had worked so hard for, but instead of getting through it like I had been able to over the past 6 months I let the anxiety be debilitating and I just bolted out and had a long panic attack in my car.  When this sort of thing happens I get incredibly bad anxiety about explaining myself and with most jobs I've had where this happens I just straight up never come back or speak to anyone at the workplace again because that seems like a better alternative than explaining that i'm such a mess that I can't get through one fucking day without having debilitating anxiety/panic attacks.  And that's what I've done in this case too.  I knew I was making a mistake but I just couldn't overcome the anxiety.  To say i'm disappointed in myself would be an understatement.  I've been semi-confident going into things that I've messed up before but this time really felt like it was different.  I had worked so hard and so much has lead up to this and for me to just screw it up on the FIRST DAY is just incredibly demoralizing and just reassures my previous mindset that I am literally incapable of basic functioning, holding a job, or eventually supporting myself financially.  I just feel like I've had every resource possible available to me to help myself and get better but I still can't overcome this.  I am at a whole new level of hopelessness and lack of self-confidence.  I haven't even told my family or friends about what happened yet because I've already done this so many times and it's incredibly embarrassing to explain this sort of thing, and it'll be even worse this time.  Honestly i'm just incredibly depressed and suicidal and I don't know what to do.  Is there any hope for me at all?  I just don't feel like I'll ever be able to function like a normal human or hold a job or support myself, and honestly being dead just seems like a better alternative than living my whole adult life dependent on my parents or whatever other option I have.

I don't even think i'm looking for advice or anything I just wanted a space that I can express what my situation is and vent.  If you actually read all of this, thank you."
99abui,54,2018-08-22,I once got a totally unnecessary surgery to get out of work.,SadPause,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/99abui/i_once_got_a_totally_unnecessary_surgery_to_get/,"I was once working at a company that simply refused to hire more people even when it is absolutely needed. Our job normally required 5 or more people working at the same time, yet we were working as a 4 member team and two of them just quit. So me and my colleague were doing the job of at least 5 people, working overtime every day and having trouble keeping up with the schedule yet they still didn't hire anyone to replace the people who quit. Our job included paperwork (imagine lots and lots of paperwork) and our desks were so full, there were even a few landslides. This went on for two and a half months, we were going out of our minds at that point and asked when they would hire a new person. They told us ""they were still looking for it"" (after near 3 months) yet we learned from an intern that since we were doing such a good job ourselves, higher ups decided it isn't urgent and they considered it be too expensive to hire more people. My colleague decided to quit the next day and I figured I would be left alone doing all the work, all by myself, so I needed a solution. I didn't want to quit my job, as it paid kind of well and I needed that, so I remembered what the doctor told me when I visited about 6 months prior, I had a thick and sharp piece of bone inside my nose that might be slightly improved with a surgery or might not work at all. It didn't effect my breathing or anything, but it sometimes faintly hurt (do to it being kinda sharp) but that's about it. I went to the doctor the next day, got a surgery and I got a month off (I had tubes in my nose). My colleague did quit his job the next day just as he said and since there was no one to do our job, they ABSOLUTELY HAD TO hire more people. (I hear they tried to pull some people from other departments at first to fill in for us, but it was a big mess). When I came back, I had 4 new people under me and a gigantic smirk that lasted a few months. (until they fired 2 of them for no reason anyway)"

99akzb,1,2018-08-22,The Story of ACPL,ACPL,ACPL,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACPL/comments/99akzb/the_story_of_acpl/,"*”I turned to my side and smiled. I wrapped my arm around my partner, hugged her close and put our foreheads together. I opened my eyes to only wake up. Alone.”*

Moving from Las Vegas, Nevada, to San Jose, California, he would find struggle with integrating himself into this new life. A new atmosphere and new people. Finding himself would prove difficult his first (and last) year of middle school in CA. Not many new friends were made if at all. Though this would change for him entering into high school. 

ACPL would be determined to make change in a place where it would not only be new for him but for others. After the awkwardness of finding himself, ACPL did find himself in others. He made close friends, friends with his peers and with the teachers. Going through high school they’d form close bonds with each other. ACPL would have made at least 5 very close friends and with many others. 

Aside from social acceptance and success, ACPL found good with academic work as well. He would find creative modes of presentation and data. He’d even find himself interning at a maker’s space. There he learned things from wood working, laser cutting, vinyl cutting/pressing, working with acrylic and much more.

After 4 years which would have seemed like decades, the end was finally nearing. On the graduation stage he’d cry at the thought of his, his friends, and his peers success. He was proud of himself and everyone. But, more so that their journey together has ended. Though their high school years together had ended they would still keep in contact for the continuing years to come. 

The next Act would see him progressing to a new playing field: University. As he had done entering high school and using what he had learned, ACPL would go on to make a new stand for himself in this new place. 

He was located in the dorm. A small room that housed 3 people and was connected to another room that also housed 3 people by a bathroom. His roommates would be one annoying and another a friend. He’d also befriend the suite mates in the other room. The unruly roommate would prove himself to be a challenge living with; messy, loud, alarm clock going off in the morning. Though this didn’t deter him.

ACPL would hang with his roommates that he considered close friends. He’d also occasionally hang out in the hallways and befriend those that pass by. In total he would have made around 5 close friends.

Aside from this something else would have happened. As he was walking the hallways looking for his class, he’d meet his eyes with one of the most beautiful person he has ever saw. He didn’t think much of it and left it.

This changed as the person he saw lived right down the hall from him. ACPL would be scared but eventually found the courage to ask her out. Being met with a yes. 

ACPL would continue to be with his friends and this person till the end of their college life. Experiencing their hardships and laughter together. With the rest of the story being left to the imagination but ending with a happy ending.

However, this is not ACPL’s story. This is not my story. The story doesn’t continue with imagination, as it was all imagination! The former was the hopes and dreams, the ideal series of events if you will that would have happened. The following is the true story of my life.


—————————-


**Act 1 - High School**


*”An advantage of being naive is to believe yourself to have had a good time.”*

The beginning part and some of the ending is partially true. As a shy, socially awkward teen I would find close friends. Though mutual respect was a given, I would learn that it was all a facade. There would be also workings of my social ineptness that would manifest and a few events that would haunt me today. I will not talk about these certain events, but will leave it at that I had crossed boundaries I didn’t know. I will though talk about some of my social ineptness.

I had not known how to really interact with people. For one I spent a majority of my time playing video games and watching cartoons. Basically shut in. For the earlier parts of high school I’d make remarks and do things that something a bully would do. I didn’t know. I had thought it would have been playful teasing but it would be bullying. 

Though, over time I would begin to learn socially what is acceptable and not. Similarly to how the ideal story goes that’s how the rest went till the end of high school. Looking back now, I was naive to think that high school was a good time. That people actually liked me. Going to a reunion, it was evident I was hated by some. I am the same person, but not the same as I was in high school. I took this as a opportunity to reflect on my faults and actions tremendously.

Alongside taking place during high school we’re troubles at home. My family of 7 was living in 3 rooms. Well technically one was the garage where I slept, on a couch. My 2 pet rabbits would have died due to my own fault and carelessness. I had made a mistake and I didn’t know. I had developed chronic lower back pain from improper sitting whilst on the computer and from sleeping on the couch. Sometimes it would reduce me from walking to suddenly kneeling on the floor. The house would also be a care home for mentally ill clients. It was the house that housed the mentally ill males. They were aggressive some times. 

After the death of my rabbits, I would soon come into possession of a dog. One that I would love so much when no one else would love me. I had not trained her well and she would bite and be aggressive. She’d be stuck in the garage with me, often looking out of the door at the sky. She would sleep with me on the couch. My dog’s behavior of course would get better over time and I would walk her frequently to the park close by. 

In the time around the last year of high school we were in the process of moving. I would have become the black sheep in my family for not being religious. I would get hit due to this, though it was resolved and my bond with my family is close. 

After 4? years of moving from Las Vegas to California we had finally been able to move from the care home. We had moved to another city a couple hours away. I cried when we moved. We had moved so much and experienced many bad things. The house was beautiful. I had my own room and my dog would be able to run around freely in the back. I would have cleaned the backyard removing all the weeds by hand so my dog can be free from thorns. I’d make myself a little garden too in the back. I’d take my dog for a walk around the neighborhood too. Those walks were long and we saw many things like the canyon crevice thingy that we visited a lot. 

Come forward to the final year of high school I would finish school despite moving to another city. My dad would drive me to school early in the morning, drive a few hours to the school and go off to do Uber. It would even be longer the ride home. I am thankful for what my dad had endured for me.

One time I was just a couple minutes late to school. This made my dad make me get up an extra hour early. 

My internship also wasn’t glamorous. We were taught things, but would ultimately be left to our own devices. In my spare time I made wooden swords with my limited knowledge. My dad hated that I made swords. The most meaningful things that we did at the internship was taking stock, cleaning the back room, and going through spreadsheets. I like spreadsheets.

Eventually high school would end, and I would end up crying with how me and my friends journey together was over. I was accepted to a few CSUs and only one UC. I was optimistic for the future thinking it’d be a positive one.

I was wrong.


———————


**Act 2 - College**


*”This is my history. And, like all other histories, it is a narrative of misery.”*

Like in the ideal story, a majority of it was true. Except. I did poorly in a few of my classes. I was rejected by that girl. I was friend zoned. The following years I would have to return home and go to community college due to financial issues. We had moved 3 times in one year. A few of my grandparents would also pass away.

The first time sharing a house with bad people and sharing 1 room and a basement between the 7 of us. I would often walk my dog around the downtown where we lived. The second time to a home my aunt owned but wasn’t using. I still slept in the garage. After a few months we suddenly, due to my mom’s direction, moved to a much nicer home. There we had two rooms. The living arrangements was due to an exchange my mom made where we took care of the owner’s dad and we got to live there. I make it work and clean the house.

School-wise I was still at community college. I had only made 2-3 friends there. I had to drop a class due to an overwhelming majority of the class failing midterm and one of them being me. On a positive note, I was offered a student job where I was paid to draw because initially I had drawn my professor which he found great. I was rejected from the university and would have to continue in community college.

I wouldn’t really have anyone to hang out with. No real friends close by. I’d spend my time alone playing games, working on personal projects, with my dog, etc. At least something to keep me busy when I was alone.


————————-


**Act 2.5 - Thought**


*”To contemplate is to look into despair.”*

I am told I think too much, that I contemplate a lot. Well what is there when all I have by myself is myself.

I think about how much I was naive and how much I hurt people in high school and how I was hated and why. It was all my fault.

I think about the funerals and how they traumatized me. I cry just thinking about what my parents would have felt during that time. Once desensitized, I now cry at just thinking of death or funerals. I think about my parents.

I think about how much of a failure I am performing poorly with some classes and having to take extra years to graduate. It’s all my fault. I’m a failure.

I think about how I compare my life to my friends and to others. Everyone is doing great things. They’re maturing, having success, meeting new people. I’m just some stupid kid still playing games occasionally and playing dress up. 

The worse one I think about is my crippling loneliness and inadequacy. I have all the people at the tip of my fingers yet I cannot bring myself to contact them. Or rather, I cannot at all. Their new journeys and experiences would be so alien to me that I could not relate at all. I think about how I was rejected and how she has a partner now and how I still talk to her. There must be something wrong with me. I must’ve deserved this. Who could love me? I hate myself. I’m disgusting and unwanted. No one would want me. I’m not attractive or have anything. When they look for Anthony it’s always another Anthony.

It’s selfish for me to even think of my problems relating to her. She did nothing wrong. Blame has no place for her. I only have myself to blame.

It’s better to stay alone so I don’t become a burden to others. 

When thoughts of happiness and hope appear I imagine beating myself. True happiness and hope? It’s all false. It’ll never happen. Short term, sure. But overall no. So I imagine myself punching and kicking me to remind the reality of it all.

I’ve taken up making costumes so that I can escape this turmoil. That I can make others happy and make myself happy for a while by not being me. I can dress up and be a whole new person that isn’t me.

I do not wish this pain upon others. I hope they never feel this despair.



—————————-


**Act 3 - Future Plans**


*”What now?”*

Suicide is off the table. It’s not even an option. I want to live life to see it to the end. But that also means living a life a torture. And, that’s okay in the grand scope of things.

It’s a life of torture, but at least I get a life to see.

*”Eternal life, endless torture.”*

I plan on using my creative skills to open an online shop and sell costume related things like capes, armor for dogs, and sell things like led wall art. Hopefully I can use this money to be debt free.

I am a young man that has nothing to lose (besides my dog). I plan on finding work wherever possible once I get to it.

I plan on getting fit which I already am with how active I am by keeping myself busy. 

Having a family of my own is off the tables now. I won’t be able to have a daughter and maybe even a wife. I suppose I’ll be playing the Hermit and Fool cards. Although I am alone, at least I can make my life meaningful by helping others and putting a smile on their faces despite not having one on mine.

When I get to that point I’ll buy land and build myself a home with shipping containers. I’ll have my door open to all in need. The house will be self sufficient with a garden for food too.

I don’t know if I’ll ever explore the world. I would want a partner to explore it with me. But I guess I probably won’t. 

Since I won’t be able to have kids I will take to helping others, my sisters, my other family if needed, and other youth if I am able to.

And, though I have these plans, I’m not sure if it’s safe to even have these when my previous plans had ended in despair.

And it hurts that I caused you something that wasn’t happiness. I miss holding you at night and lying on your lap on the couch. I miss how your hand always fit mine. I miss kissing our pinky promises. I miss watching shows while giving massages. I miss driving and holding your hand or playing with your hair. I miss how you danced with me out of step. I miss when you make me laugh at your dumb jokes. I miss looking into your eyes while you smile at me. Never gets old. I miss talking late at night and going to our favorite spots- I’ve been visiting them often these days. I miss telling you my worries and fears and you telling me it was okay. I miss coming up with new silly and mushy nicknames every half year or so.  I miss hearing you discuss your game plans for school. I miss beating you at Pokémon as you beat me at Civ. I miss the tickle fights and eating each other’s food. I miss playing devils advocate when talking about the future, politics, ethics, religion, or even if ketchup is a sauce or topping. I miss your insanely beautiful mind. How it knew what was wrong with the world and what was right.

It hurts that you believe we can’t work. That we can’t change. But honestly, we’re not the same kids we were the day we started. And it hurts that you think we haven’t changed when we have.

I may be wrong- I’m not always right. But you’ve always made me see the good in people. And you make me realize when things are wrong. I regret never making that known. My pride gets in the way. You made me realize I need help. You encouraged me to follow my dreams. You always gave great advice. I know you always say I don’t follow it and that frustrates me because I always do. Even now, you don’t know the things I’ve followed through on because of you.

I miss you so much though. I want to wake up to find this was all a dream. But I know I can’t. And I know I’m at your mercy for when you’re ready to talk things out whenever that is- whether this is really over or not. Because to me it’s not, and it won’t be until you look me in the eyes and say it- until we talk. But of course I’m gonna tell you I still believe because I always have and always will. The more I talk to friends and family- even those I haven’t spoken to in a while- the more I’m sure that it really is possible. But it hurts that you might feel like it’s impossible.

I want us to work on ourselves. I want us to be our best individual selves. And I think that we can also be those two people together. But if that’s not true to you then you can bet your bottom dollar that I’ll still always be your number one cheerleader.

All I ever want is your happiness. I want you to get that internship, those grades, I want you to travel the world and eat the best food and play the best games and make the best friends and get into a kick ass graduate school. I want to see you work for the best company or lab. I want to see you succeed in everything you possibly can in life. I want you to be happy so bad because I love you. And I want so badly to be by your side when you do, because I know you will. You will do so many beautiful things in this world. 

I want to look at my kids one day and see you in their eyes. I want to travel and live abroad with you. I want to have fur babies and raise them to do the best tricks. I want to teach you how to make eggs while you show me a Dragon Ball episode. I want to take you to temple with my grandma. I want to show our kids a love of science and sport. I want to hear them speaking a language I don’t know and see your mischievous expression. I want to be like my aunt and uncle who say they found love at our age and made it work- they faced the same problems (I never got to tell you).  I want to be the couple that can make it through hell, we already have before. When it’s good it’s so good. When it’s bad we get to work.

I still see all of this working. Others do too, but it’s not their opinion that matters. It’s ours. I will wait forever if I have to. You could come to me married with kids and I’d still take you. But I want to be my best self- if not for me then for you. I want you to look at me and think ‘wow.’ I want you to look at me and know that I can change. That we can change, without changing who we are at the core, in order to love each other the best way we can. We’re not the first people to ever go through this shit. And I don’t resent you for your actions. They’ve caused me sadness and pain but I’m realizing why you’ve done what you did. You think my core is unlovable. But just a few months ago you thought differently. 

Despite all this I just keep thinking of you and how you’re doing. I want you to be okay. I don’t want to see you sad or in pain. I wish I was there to comfort you if you are. I wish I could talk everything out with you. I want you to tell me everything. I want to keep every promise we ever made. I want to keep every promise I made. To love you unconditionally. I want to be there if you need to cry or scream or seethe with anger and I want to ease it. I want to get you food when you’re hungry- I hope you’re eating. I want to hold you when you go to sleep- I hope you’re sleeping. I want to make you laugh when you’re bored- I hope you’re laughing.

I can take it. I’ve already been taking it to a degree. I want to say I’m sorry. For everything. For causing you pain without knowing. For not making it known how you make my life happier. For not telling you how everyone knows how much I love you because my favorite subject is you. You’re my pride and joy. And I’m heartbroken I’m not the same for you right now. I miss when I was.  But I mostly miss you."

So here's the situation. I'm a rising senior and I bought a macbook pro 2018 15 inch (2.2 base) with internship money. My parents want me to show independence next year and pay for all costs but tuition. I have enough saved up from previous internships to do so, but I feel so much guilt dropping 2.5k on a laptop. I have a perfectly fine gaming laptop from 2015, but my gripes are that it's fat and I have difficulty carrying it around on campus. It also has a failing battery, so I have to carry a brick of a charger around with it. Anyways, fiscally I can most definitely afford the macbook, but I'm having trouble justifying the purchase with an older laptop laying around unused. What would you guys do in my situation?

Edit: A point to take into consideration is that while I have enough to cover living expenses and apartment cost I'll be really stretched thin if I were to want to travel during break. Since it's my last year in college I want to make the most of it and go to Asia or Europe with my friends."

It was a lot so we decided to put it all in a meeting room,he took a room and so did I. I checked the booking system and we had to be out in 2 hours. Plenty of time for a compitant employee. I get mine sorted in about an hour and wait for the meeting to end to get the next batch in. Boss Mcdouche face decides to have an intern who has no idea what he is doing do his half and it hits the two hour mark.

This is how to rest of the day goes 

Me(tech with 4 years experience)

Boss(My d bag boss)

INT(Intern with little experience)

Me: Where's boss ?

INT: Went for an early lunch im doing his stuff now.

Me: There is meeting in here we gotta get this stuff moved.

INT: OK

Boss loses it that I cleared HIS meeting room before a meeting with the companies MD took place. 

Boss: How dare you move my stuff. 

Me : There's a meeting in there.

Boss : I DON'T GIVE A SHIT. DON'T MOVE MY 
STUFF.DO IT AGAIN YOUR OFF THIS PROJECT.

Me : Got it.

(My project BTW)

The next day when their is about 5 meetings in the same room practically back to back he FILLS it with different equipment and leaves it there. So did I. When they pleaded I said it will cost me my job to move that kit.  

5 missed / cancelled meetings later with contractors / advisors / clients costing the company a pretty penny I get a new boss. 

Heads up I don't blame the intern. "
99bmo7,25,2018-08-22,[FR] Overcame Shyness and Got an IOI from Crush,yungshmoneygal,RedPillWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/99bmo7/fr_overcame_shyness_and_got_an_ioi_from_crush/,"Some background info: maybe some of you remember my past posts asking for advice on how to overcome shyness, especially when it comes to showing my interest to men through things like eye contact and receptiveness. I've also asked how to put myself out there romantically in a college setting because I definitely struggled there. For the past 3 months, I've been in nun mode to work on myself, my passions, and my people skills. I've said hi and started conversations with more people in a single day than I used to in a month. This has made me a lot more confident than I used to be because it made me realize that people weren't cold to me because I'm not worthy. They were cold to me because I was seemed just as cold to them! I've filled my schedule to the brim with duties (schoolwork, family, internships and job), hobbies (cooking, writing, songwriting, singing), and community involvement (I've gotten super involved with 2 clubs at my university) so I have no time to sit around and wait for a man to fill a void of boredom and loneliness, which only led to neediness or a defensive mentality on my part. This is a stark contrast from where I was exactly one year ago, where all I did was spend hours scrolling through Instagram and going out with friends to do nothing but eat or shop.

&amp;#x200B;

After all these things have changed, I decided to go back to a place I mentally abandoned because of the blue pill - church. I went because I felt like it was the last missing piece of the puzzle, as my life slowly improved day by day but still was incomplete. There, I was shocked to see my crush from a class I took last year attending mass. I thought I showed IOIs to him last year but he was unreceptive, so I eventually moved on, assuming he just wasn't attracted to me. Because I was so shocked at seeing him here, I couldn't help but look at him a bit longer than usual. Our eyes met for a second or two and for the first time; I wasn't overly timid and didn't look away. I eventually just kept on walking back to my pew and continued what I came to do: try to reignite my spirituality. I left feeling happy that I found time to go to church and listen to the gospel, and left with my friend.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't think much of it and walked home, only to receive a text from him asking if I went to mass. I was so shocked to hear from him almost immediately after I left. Before, I was so afraid of seeming needy or desperate (because I *was* needy and desperate) that I responded to him hours, even days late, sometimes with way too little or too much information, even though I was very attracted to him. No wonder he didn't progress anything! This time around, I responded without thinking too much about it, and we had a quick conversation. Long story short, he made plans to meet up next week during mass and to catch up, which is way more initiative and interest than he's ever shown towards me before. Perhaps he just wants to be friends, but I'm just happy that following the advice I've received from this subreddit has gotten me much further with a crush than I've ever gotten before. I'm shocked that I managed to be asked to spend time with a guy without excessively relying on dating apps. I thought that deleting Tinder and Bumble this school year meant I would have way less chances to date!

&amp;#x200B;

I definitely don't want to overthink this and project a future with or an idealized personality onto this guy. After all, I only know him well enough to consider him as nothing more than an acquaintance! As of right now, he's just a cute somebody who I'm about to spend some time with. But I wanted to take the time and tell this story so I could thank RPW and everyone who's tried to help me in the past few months. Even if it doesn't work out with this guy, I've finally grown to be stable enough that it would take a lot more than a harmless rejection to rock the boat, all thanks to what RPW has taught me to do. Thank you for making me more confident than I've ever been my whole life - I definitely wouldn't have known how to do it without your help. Although this FR is quite uneventful, I hope that any new RP ladies who have similar struggles with overcoming their insecurities or getting male attention like me can see that RPW really does help if you stick to it and work on yourself!

After 12 days together I walked him to the bus stop this morning, to catch a bus that will take him to an airport 6hours away from which he flies.

It's been barely 2 and a half hours since then and I already miss seeing his ""stupid"" face and being randomly poked by him. I wish we at least knew when the next meeting will be, but all we know is that he will probably be the one to travel again (my master thesis starts in september and I doubt they will let me take any free days) and that it probably wont be anytime soon(-ish) cause he just got a 2.5-month job contract.

On the bright side, the days together were really really nice. He finally got to meet my family and absolutely astonished everyone with his speaking of phrases in my language that I thought him, which was just so cute I couldnt stop smiling. We walked around a lot, to places I usually dont go that much on my own (he's an avid walker and it kinda rubbed pff on me, too). I loved seeing him take in the landscape, especially how much he loved the mountain views from our balcony. He also met my bestfriends and made everyone laugh a fair bit. 

I only had one breakdown in all the time together, brought on by stress (I had to translate stuff all the time while we were staying at my family bc my grandparents and mom dont speak english one bit and my siblings and father were too lazy to do it all the time... after a couple of days grandma's constant asking if he wants anything to eat/drink and nagging about taking more food just got to me, together with SO many people on a relatively small space). It didnt help that on that exact day we were chatting about ""what happens next"" (my studies, his work) and when I asked him if he still thinks about moving when I get my internship, he said maybe and that it is still far away. I have a feeling that he wouldn't really want to move out of his country, but doesn't want to tell me straightforwardly. For now, I left it at ""I tell you when I get to know where I can get my internship and then we see further. I don't want to live like this longer than I really have to, tho.""

For now, I cope. With him being away again. With arranging videocalls again (we kinda neglected them in the last 3 months before I went over). With trying to fall asleep without slipping into ""he is so far away, he doesnt even miss me anymore, he got used to the situation, we will never live together like normal couples, nothing will ever work out"". With keeping occupied until I get back to uni and trying not to fear it at the same time.

Right now, I feel like summer's already ended."

&amp;#x200B;

I turned 18 two weeks ago and I'm going into 2nd year of University in September.  I am not eligible for OSAP (Government funding) because of my parent's income even though they're divorced.  My family can be considered mid-upper of middle class.  I am **not** receiving any active financial support from my parents, but I do have an RESP.  I will do a run down of my past employment + net worth below.

&amp;#x200B;

**Income**

Age 14-17 |  Worked part time for the City as a skating instructor (very limited hours).  I earned about $15,000 total.

Age 13-17 |  Did a lot of freelance work online - Graphic design, digital design, web design/development, game-related coding.  I earned about $25,000 total.

Age 17-18 | I've been into cryptos for a while but never invested heavily into it.  I put about $6,000 into various cryptos in Sept and Oct 2017 (because of some whisperings of huge spike in some communities im in), and by January it was worth about $25,000.  I cashed out $15k and now have \~$3500 in cryptos (value down from 10k)

&amp;#x200B;

**Expenses**

First year of University (2 terms, 8 months) costed me approx. $17,600:

Tuition - $6,420

Residence - $10,506 (Includes 3 meals a day)

Textbooks - $212.50 (I bought them all used ayy)

Various other expenses (Extra meals, snacks, laundry, hardcore online shopping) - \~$500

I also built a new PC because mine was getting very old, and I needed something stronger to do media editing.  I also live-stream video games. $2000

Going on dates and buying presents approx. $500

Total expenses Fall 2017 - July 2018: approx. $20,000

&amp;#x200B;

**Net Worth**

Liquid Assets - I currently have approx. 

$3,000 in chequings

$5,000 in savings (trying not to touch)

$1,500 in cash, stashed in various places in case of emergency

\-----------------------------

$9,500 total

&amp;#x200B;

Non-Liquid Assets

$3,500 in various cryptocurrencies

$12,000 in RESP

$1,600 in Gold

\---------------------------

$17,100 total

&amp;#x200B;

**My Situation**

I am currently unemployed but have applied for positions near my school.  I'm hoping for a skating instruction position where I can make $17.50 and hour, but if that falls through I will go for a minimum wage position elsewhere.

I'm in a 5-year bachelors program.  8 academic terms + 5 co-op terms.  My program is Honours Arts and Business.  I'm studying psychology as my major with a specialty in Behavioral Psychology and a minor in Sociology.  I originally wanted to do a double degree in something that would give me qualifications for Computer Science because I have an interest in Artificial Intelligence.  **Because of a brain trauma in October 2017, my cognitive speed has dropped by more than 75% and I still haven't recovered.**  When the incident first occurred, I couldn't string a sentence together for a few days, and couldn't do any math (single digit or otherwise) for almost a month.  I still have issues with verbal communication.  I went from a 98% studying about 30 mins - 1 hour a day to studying 5 hours a day and getting 60% average.  

I have to push back my co-op terms due to my brain trauma, so I'm planning to string 2 or 3 of them together, and do an 8-month or 12-month co-op.  Getting an opportunity overseas is also an option if the conditions are good enough and expenses low enough.

I have a family connection in my local Google regional office and I am trying to get a co-op there as an intern with their Artificial Intelligence research team.  At this point, due to my brain trauma, I doubt that it will happen.  Before my injury, it was quite likely that I would get the position.

First year generally costs more than any other year (unless I go for a graduate degree).  I'm hoping to spend $15,000 per academic year or less.

&amp;#x200B;

**My Questions**

*How can I begin to save money effectively?*  I plan to start a spreadsheet tracking all my income and expenditure.  This will also help me to hold back from impulse spending because seeing it on paper will make me feel bad :(

*Once I get a job, how much of my money should go into future savings vs. education savings?*

*At this point in my life, should I be considering investments?*

*Is it too early to consider saving for retirement, maybe in very small deposits? (i.e Education savings, post-graduate savings, AND retirement savings)*

*Any other general tips for a University Student?*

99cpaf,2,2018-08-22,The contribution of open source to bullshit jobs,crashspringfield,opensource,https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/99cpaf/the_contribution_of_open_source_to_bullshit_jobs/,"Reading David Graeder's *Bullshit Jobs* (pp. 218-9), I came across an interesting passage:

&amp;#x200B;

*Shullenberg speaks of an emerging ""voluntariat,"" with capitalist firms increasingly harvesting the results not of paid labor but of unpaid interns, internet enthusiasts, activists, volunteers, and hobbyists, and ""digitally sharecropping"" the results. The free software industry, perversley enough, has become a paradigm in this respect. The reader may recall Pablo, who introduced the notion of duct taping in chapter 2: software engineering work was divided between the interesting and challenging work of developing core technologies, and the tedious labor of ""applying duct tape"" to allow different core technologies to work together, because the designers had never bothered to think about compatibility. His main point, though, was that, increasingly, open source means that all the really engaging tasks are done for free.*

&amp;#x200B;

*Pablo: Where two decades ago, companies dismissed open source software and developed core technologies in-house, nowadays companies rely heavily on on open source and employ software developers almost entirely to apply duct tape on core technologies they get for free.*

*In the end, you can see people doing the nongratifying duct-taping wok during office hours and then doing gratifying work on core technologies during the night.*

*This leads to an interesting vicious circle: given that people choose to work on interesting core technologies for free, no company is investing in those technologies. The underinvestment means that the core technologies are often unfinished, lacking quality, have a lot of rough edges, bugs, etc. That, in turn, creates need for duct tape and thus proliferation of duct-taping jobs.*

&amp;#x200B;

*Paradoxically. the more software engineers collaborate online to do free creative labor simply for the love of doing it, as a gift to humanity, the less incentive they have to make them compatible with other such software, and the more those same engineers will have to be employed in their day jobs fixing the damage--doing the sort of mainenance work that no one would be willing to do for free.*

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:** Developers contribute to open source projects for free because it interests them. Companies embrace open source because it gets them 90% of the product for free. Those same developers are often employed doing the uninteresting work of ""duct-taping"" or fitting the open source software to specific applications and making it work with others.  


&amp;#x200B;

While the analysis over simplifies the situation, I think it raises intersting points. Thinking here of the ""well if the software is free, why do I need to hire a developer?"" perspective, but also thinking about my job as someone who is employed to implement open-source software. Many times I do find bugs in the technology we're using and fix it locally, but as a contractor, I'm technically not allowed to give those fixes back. The company's perspective is that, since they're paying me, I work for them and not the open source project, and they seem to forget the large codebase they're getting for free from the open source project. (Thankfully, via some magic, those fixes always find their way back).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm interested in hearing others' perspectives on the passage, and what the relationship is between your contributions to open source projects and your day jobs."
99d13k,4,2018-08-22,My best friend stabs me in the back,Beer_conquers_all,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/99d13k/my_best_friend_stabs_me_in_the_back/,"So me and my best friend go back more than 7 years. We stuck together through high school and started university together. Throughout that time, I always had his back. When he got sick, I rushed to the hospital. When he was lonely, I introduced him to my friends.

However, he dropped out of university and now works a shitty job. So we started drifting apart, I suppose.

In the last 2 years, that went from bad to worse. He met a new friend at work that I truly can't stand and they seem to have become a single symbiotic entity. Why I can't stand that friend: he is the epitome of a neckbeard. Has zero social skills. I have suffered his presence for 2 years, but I know nothing about his personal life. My suspicion is that there is nothing. But if you leech your way into groups of friends but they know nothing about you, that freaks me out. Maybe I am jealous (highly probably, I miss spending time with my friend).

Some examples of backstabs suffered by my friend:

- we have a discord together with some other friends. Used to be a nice community. My friend invited his work buddy. Now they play together all the time, but are so focused on their game that the other guys don't log in anymore because, as one of them said ""it's a waste of effort trying to start a conversation"".

- me and my friend planned a trip together to a place that has meaning to me in regards to my deceased mother. My friend decided to offer me a choice ""either take the third guy along, or we go somewhere else"". I was too stunned to react. They went together.

- I started a tabletop roleplaying group. Guess who just had to get invited along? In the meantime I have made clear that person is not welcome anymore.

- That friend has been ditching me for other friends I introduced him to.

- In company, he likes to banter. You know, playfully insult eachother. Problem is: i'm better at it. So when he gets an answer back, he starts about subjects that are sensitive to me. An example: back when I just got out of an abusive relationship, he retorted with ""yeah, go on home. Alone."". Whenever he feels insecure, he apparently needs to take it out on me.

- When I was done with my internship, he suddenly did not have any time to meet up. Everything was full, even though I asked months in advance if he could keep some time free.

Now, I have talked to him about that. Problem is: he always has an explanation ready. He does not see that he manages to hurt other people by being inconsiderate.

The thing is, I am just so angry because of the way he has treated me over the years, that I just lash out whenever a small thing happens. A lot of resentment has been growing up in this friendship and now it has boiled over I fear. Ending that friendship seems like something I don't want to do just yet. Maybe because I fear having to find new friends and don't know really how to. When we talk about it, he does say he wants to work on it... But I'm not sure I really care anymore. When we do meet up, it is sometimes like before, but when we have less contact, resentment builds up.

Apologies if I seem dramatic, but it is a situation that does hurt me and I don't know where else to get advice.

Kind regards! "

&amp;#x200B;

I live in a shared apartment with 3 other people. One of my roommates didn't re-sign our lease - he kind of just left, didn't let myself or my landlord know - kind of like an asshole, but anyways. 

&amp;#x200B;

So currently I'm living with 2 others: One is in law school - He does a lot of peacework in Africa when he's not in school, he has done this his whole life. He is in Africa right now doing said peacework returning at the end of August. The other roommate is in school for International Diplomacy, he is a former diplomat born and raised in Algeria. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I've been doing my landlord a favor and trying to find a new roommate the last 3 weeks, my two current roomies are away on internships. Haven't had anyone commit as of yet. So my roommate told me of someone he knew in Africa who is coming here to study and I told him to pass my contact info along to him. I exchanged info with him and within 20 minutes he wanted to move in (this Saturday).  I have a few more people coming to see the apartment, and I'd really like to not be the only person in the apartment without some tie to Africa - Don't want to feel like an outcast. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does that make me an asshole? How should I tell this to my two current roommates?

I went with her over the weekend to help her move back into her apartment and we made the commitment to make the drive to see each other at least one time during the week and on the weekends during the school year. 

A couple of days go by and she tells me that she is having doubts about being in this relationship. She told me that she loves me still, but she is happier on her own now and needs to think things over with me. She said that she is going to be very busy during the school year and she needs this time to focus on herself and she is worried that I am not going to be able to be a part of her life while she’s doing this.

I’m really confused and scared at this point because our relationship felt so solid before she moved back. When she was living with me, she and I both have talked endlessly about our future together. We have even thrown around the idea of getting engaged and getting a place together one day.

Right now I plan on just being patient with her and hoping for the best but preparing for the worst. I just don’t know how this happened and I feel completely blindsided. It would be a shame to lose someone as special as her.

I’m looking for advice on how to talk to her when I do get that chance. I really want things to work out."

I realized I will have about 140k in debt (estimating about 100k in private loans from salliemae and 40k from federal loans) after I graduate.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Background: I am attending a top 5 computer science university, with the goal of becoming a software engineer when I graduate. I recently got a return offer to intern at a company again (I'm a rising junior) that, if I was to intern next summer there and get a return offer to work full time when I graduate, they would pay me about 100k all in in Chicago my first year.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Having this much student debt is a bit nervewracking, but given my situation, would I be able to handle it? Of course I would make sacrifices my first couple of years to make sure I'm putting as much toward the loans as possible."
99ebzi,79,2018-08-22,I think I inadvertently quit smoking weed,cloudytuesday,Drugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/99ebzi/i_think_i_inadvertently_quit_smoking_weed/,"Last time I smoked was on May 19, so it's been over 3 months. I stopped because I thought I would be having a job interview for a well-payed internship. 

The company wants me, but they're on a hiring freeze. Recently I was told that I could be hired in a week, a month, or even a year, and that their hands are tied.

So I spent my summer just waiting for that green light, which still has never come.

At this point I realize that I could smoke again and it probably wouldn't make a difference, I could use someone else's urine if I was in a pinch. But the thing is, I don't even really want to. 

It used to be that getting home from a long day and smoking was a treat, a way to unwind. Now, I feel like I want to be mentally present during the free time I have. I hate the feeling of waking up the morning after smoking and having a foggy memory of the night's events.

Don't get me wrong, I'd bet money that I'll smoke again. Going to the movies or the gym/doing yoga a little buzzed is fun and to me, and a productive way to spend my high. But lately I've been watching my roommate turn into a daily smoker, and she gets so lifeless when she's high, hardly fun to be around. I wasn't necessarily like that when I smoked but it's put a bad taste in my mouth.

Even as I type this I'm a bit disappointed that weed has lost its charm for me. For now, that is. :)"

I was an intern at a start up for, starting last September, and eventually started doing freelance work for them. While I was doing this, I was working off of two different rigs, one being a desktop for when I'd edit remotely and needed to do more complex things, and the other being a laptop that was woefully unprepared for the abuse I put it through this year.  


But now, with the possibility of securing a better paying, more steady, and more taxing job on the horizon, I'm thinking about finally retiring the laptop for something a bit more equipped for what I'll be doing. So now I'm trying to decide whether or not to stay on Windows or switch to a Macbook Pro.  


A few of the factors I'm considering here are price, as getting a Windows with comparable specs to a Macbook Pro would cost significantly less, the ease of migrating work from my desktop to a Macbook if I get one (do I need specific hard drives to be able to move work easily or will I be able to simply plug drives in without any problems?) , and whether or not I would also want to go ahead and purchase Final Cut Pro for the Macbook.   


The question of Final Cut is what's really making me consider a Mac. It's the only major NLE that I haven't at least experimented with before and I really want to play around with it/learn how to use it. But I also don't know how I feel about spending extra money on a new OS just for that yet.   


Any thoughts/ideas on what I should do? "
99egeo,6,2018-08-22,My family is a beast to me and i suffer a lot from that.,joyoflifehahaha,family,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/99egeo/my_family_is_a_beast_to_me_and_i_suffer_a_lot/,"Hello everybody, 

I just didn’t find anyone to talk about my story but my sister, so i wanted to write it down and post it here ! 
I am a girl that lives in a very conservative family, i live in a north African country. My dad is a very hard man and mom is kind of a victim to my dad’s lifestyle. I lived in a house where there are always problems and violence (my dad is a very violent man but was not the only one since i had one brother that has the same character. I didn’t have to live this all by my own, i have a very close sister, she kind of is my best friend unconditionally. 
I have a brother that is extremely generous, he understood the situation and got my sister and me out of that environment, he is kind of a father to us, he helped us a lot financially, emotionally, he encouraged us a lot (he is the person i love the most in this world unlike my other beast brother whom i hate the most in this world). And so we went to study in an European country (not in the same city). Abroad we had so much fun, we acted natural, we discovered ourselves really, we met great people. After 3 years of this, i had to come back since i got a better master in my own country than in the foreign country. My sister stayed. So i came back and got into a school in a big city (different from where my parents live). The problem is that i forgot the reason why i run out of my country, not for schooling but for my freedom and wellbeing. 

So when i came back, my father and my Brother kept telling you are very dumb, stupid because you didn’t study to get a good master and i kept ignoring this. And i went to live alone in that city ( i insisted on that because my parents were so against this). I always try to run from the house, i don’t come a lot on weekends or on holidays, but in the summer after i finished my internship, i should go back for 3 weeks, i am still in the first week btw.

This morning, my mother obliged me to wear sth i didn’t want to wear. And i said no because i don’t want to wear sth that i don’t want to and it’s a basic right, to wear the way i want ( i insist that i wanted to wear a tshirt and non ripped jeans) so they obliged to do so and they began shouting at me and my dad wanted to hit me and said to me that he would throw me out of the window, and also to leave the house (that what shocked me the most). 

What is surprising is that my sister told me 3 hours before the incident that she had a nightmare and described to me the situation as i exactly lived it, but it was for her, she told me that my brother was so a beast with her, and the other brother, that is supposed to be nice, was careless, and dad threw her out of the house and she was shocked and crying and they threw her stuff and she grabbed her things and left. And she told me that i wasn’t in the dream. And i sent her a msg saying i was probably dead or got a suicide. 

Well right now, i find that life is very hard and i am in prison in my parents house and my parents and my beast brother are the guardians of this cage. And i weirdly think, in this sh***y whole, that things are going to get better and feel hopeful about when i will have the opportunity to be financially independent and run from this family forever ! I get excited just for the idea that i can be really in peace far from my family, because it does for me more harm than good."

[Cyber security organization](http://www.iicybersecurity.com/cyber-security-institute.html) experts report that the ***National Security Agency*** (NSA) is taking advantage of an avalanche of job applications to ensure the safety of their workforce for the purpose of innovating towards the future, as a part of a request of the general of the US Army, Paul Nakasone, who has just taken over the [NSA](http://www.securitynewspaper.com/2018/07/04/nsa-started-deleting-all-call-records-acquired-from-2015/).

Fort Meade, headquartered in Meade, Md. has a retention rate of 92%, reported general Nakasone, and receives about 17K job applications per month, of which 40% comes from organizations that promote diversity. The NSA ranks among the top 20 employers of computer science graduates, according to cyber security organization experts, and has won five external honors for excellence in their work. The NSA internship program attracts 9K applications a year from major universities, of which 1K is elected, 280 get an interview, and 70% of the interviewed people get hired.

“But it is the diversity of thought that encourages innovation”, added the general, which is why, as the workforce goes through training and gain experience, their managers continue to press long-term to attract a workforce with different perspectives. That includes recruiting journalists on cyber security organization issues from organizations like ***“Girls Who Code”***, nonprofit organization fighting against genre breach on computer science. “The workforce of the future must be representative of the diversity of our nation”.

Because of the agency’s vital partnerships with industry, academia, research centers, and foreign governments, the NSA’s workforce managers also make sure to maintain “a large workforce that has incentives to develop themselves professionally in this field”.

At a glance at the agency’s structure (information on the size of its workforce is classified, but it is estimated that the NSA employs between 30K and 40K people), Nakasone described a recent test to measure the level of awareness in cyber security organization of its employees, trying to maintain the highest standards in security. “The knowledge gained from America’s experience in the fights against Al Qaeda and ISIS is now being applied to confront today’s threats”, said the general.

Cyber security organization experts from the International Institute of Cyber Security commented that the NSA has also established partnerships with 14 countries and private companies to search for security in new technologies in areas such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, Internet of Things (IoT), encryption and the upcoming 5g communications network, thus showing its level of commitment to innovation."

Everything with weed was totally new and awesome, music, girls, movies, the moments i got with my friends, and all of them were remarkable. But also, when i started smoking weed, i tough it was the ""best"" thing i could have discovered in that time, because for me, it was total fun and no bad consequences.

Then i started having trouble in school (nothing new to me in my life), and then i learned how to go to school high but functional. I had the best year in my life in that school, but then my dad found out i was smoking, we had some issues and in the end, i had to start living with my mom in another city. I tough my life was ruined forever or shit, started going to my new school totally numb, sleeping inside the classroom or skipping classes just because i didn't had any motivation for studying or listening to asshole teachers. Some time passed and i got caught by police with weed and they told my mom by telephone. My mom talked to me, and then 1 month later (yesterday), she busted me smoking in the bathroom with my eyes red as the devil. Then i started thinking how i was making my mom disappointed and not caring about that at all, i was only thinking about myself when i was smoking weed inside our own house, chasing the pleasures weed gives me and everything. I spent some considerable time of my sleep awake and thinking about my life.

Today she talked to me and asked me to promise her i would give some serious effort in stopping weed, because if i don't stop and she get me smoking again she will intern me in a rehab clinic.

That chocked me in the moment because i never tough that would happen to me, and now is so close.

I realized how i was disappointing my mother, and that i was trashing my grades at school, and weed was at the center of it. But i LOVE smoking, i can't say if i'm really an addict, because until now i never tried stopping weed for more than a week or so.

I know i won't stop weed, because for me it is one of the things i enjoy the most in my life, but now i'm feeling so bad because some of the time i spent too high to study or too numb for having a nice talk with my mom or my sister, will not be given back to me. I think i will have to repeat this grade next year, and i know it won't be good at all for me in the future. Maybe i started weed too soon... but now all i can do is learn to differentiate the time i need to focus on the regular life stuff, and the right time to chill and start smoking again.

-

In late 2017, I spent four months Hong Kong completing an internship with the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. I had such a blast, it is hard to believe I almost didn’t go.

Because it was last minute posting, I had already submitted my application to graduate and was well on my way to walking across the stage when I received the offer.

You see, in Economics 11 we learn about a concept called opportunity cost. To put it simply, it is the loss of whatever value you would have gained if you chose the next-best alternative.

In my case, it was a question of whether the value gained from an international internship would be worth the work experience lost by not starting a full time job a few months earlier.

But with a little prodding from my family and a very generous arrangement from both the Simon Fraser University Co-operative Office and Hong Kong Airlines, I decided to go for it.

Thank goodness I did.

**REMEMBER, YOU’RE TRAVELING**

Let’s start with the obvious one: you’re going somewhere new and exciting. While a standard co-op term is typically with a local firm, an international co-op is an exciting opportunity to experience a new company, with new people, in a new place. Take advantage of it by exploring and soaking in the city’s energy.

As mentioned earlier, I was afforded the chance to go to Hong Kong. Now, I lived in the city for a few years in high school so it wasn’t entirely new; still, I was out and about every weekend, bouncing from place to place with my fellow interns.

**MAKE IT COUNT**

Much like a standard co-op, international co-ops give you a chance to use tools that professionals rely on everyday, and with very real results. It isn’t some hokey school project with a hypothetical situation which you navigate through while going through the coursework; no, this is challenging yourself by finding your own solutions to real-world problems. Give it your all, and be proud of everything you accomplish.

At the Chamber, I had the opportunity to learn tools such as MailChimp, NeonCRM, and the Adobe Creative programs with an incredibly supportive team. Furthermore, I had the chance to observe and contribute to projects with tangible effects on the organization’s bottom line.

**GAIN NEW PERSPECTIVES**

Take a look at those around you during your term. Listen to their viewpoints and respect their opinions. They grew up living a completely different life, and probably have some wild ideas. Appreciate them, learn from them, and don’t forget to give your perspective as well. It’s a big world out there, but it grows a little bit smaller every time we share our ideas.

The intern cohort during my term consisted of two UVic students, one UBC, and another from the University of Alberta. Needless to say, we all seemed pretty similar at first. It’s only when we went out to observe the city around us that it became apparently how differently each of us saw the world, and how much we could learn from each other.

**TAKE RISKS AND DON’T LOOK BACK**

You own the results of everything you do, and that can be a little daunting. I’m not going to say that mistakes won’t be made, because they will. But it’s okay if you make mistakes because that’s how you learn and grow. So with that in mind, put yourself out there and don’t hold back. After all, the you’ll be headed back to school after your term is complete so what do you have to lose?

I’ll admit that I was nervous of screwing something up and always took the safe route during my first few weeks. However, my manager was constantly empowering me with decisions and supporting my choices, leading me to become increasingly comfortable doing what I thought was right. I made some wrong choices, but mistakes, once you learn from them, are just called experiences.

**CREATE MEMORIES**

Make the most of every minute, from the moment you receive your offer to when you touch down back home. You are embarking on an experience of a lifetime, so become Jim Carey in Yes Man and take things as they come.

Seriously, I cannot stress this enough. Break out of your comfort zone. Visit a flower exhibition, wine festival, or magic show. Participate a hike, pub crawl, or e-Sports tournament. And if something doesn’t work out? Well, just leave it behind. You’re only here for a few months after all.

You have an unparalleled opportunity to learn, grow, take risks, make mistakes and – at the end of it all – board a plane back to real life.

Just be sure to check the baggage weight limits for your airline because you’ll be heading home with a ton of fond memories.

99ett4,1,2018-08-22,[M4A] A Failing Factory Owner Meets a Desperate Intern [Feminisation] [Romance] [Long-term],clip-clop,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/99ett4/m4a_a_failing_factory_owner_meets_a_desperate/,"Your family has run Garrett's Fabrics for almost 100 years now, passing down from your grandfather, to your father, to you. In the past things had been good. One of the biggest regional manufacturers, you'd produced clothing that had ended up on catwalks and had been spotted on celebrities. 

But in recent years, things have taken a turn for the worst. With growing competition from multinational companies, people aren't buying local. Why spend $100 on a pair of handcrafted jeans when you can get a pair made in a sweatshop for less than half the price? Although your factory used to have hundreds of people working there, now there's less than a dozen, and even they're struggles to justify staying here when their pay-cheques are so inconsistent. 

One night, another sleepless night going over the paperwork trying to make these impossible sums turn a profit, I knock on your door. I'm a young man fresh out of a degree in business management. Fresh out being the operative word, seeing that I ended up dropping out of my course. With no real qualifications, no real family or friends in the local area, and a desire to make *something* out of my life, I've been knocking around every business in the area trying to get *some* sort of opportunity. I don't even want to be paid, I just want an internship, a chance to prove myself and get some experience. 

However, neither of us could predict how our business relationship was going to pan out. We don't know that we'll find a gap in the market, a gap for luxury lingerie and naughty outfits. We don't know that, having no money to hire models, *I'll* be the one trying them on for the photo shoots. And we don't know that, growing ever close and closer, our relationship will go from strictly business to one of pleasure...

---

Hi there! As the prompt suggests, I'm looking for a long-term feminisation prompt between a failing business owner and a desperate intern. 

I always think these prompts work best when we both have some sort of vulnerabilities. Your character will be a failing business owner (male or female, although the former is preferred) who is stressed out from having to deal with these pressures. Perhaps you've got divorced because of the stresses of the job, or your relationship is on the rocks. My character will be a young man (18+) who is effectively homeless and penniless, looking for any opportunity to get my life started. I like the idea of my character viewing yours as a father figure, with the more sexual implications that brings, but if you're not open to that I understand. 

I would like this feminisation and character development to be long-term and gradual, with our characters naturally changing. I envision a couple of events pushing this, including:

* My character not having any clean clothing, so you offer to let me borrow some stuff from the factory. However, it turns out that the only clothes in my size are for women. 

* You offer to let my character stay in your apartment to stop me having to sleep in the factory. 

* I have to dress in some of the outfits/lingerie for a photoshoot as we can't afford a model. 

I would also like elements of slice of life in this too. And I would love to hear some of your suggestions for these events too!

My main kinks are romance, feminisation, incest, cumplay/bukkake/gokkun, D/s (with me as the s) outfits and lingerie, build-up, free use, taking orders, name calling and group sex. My limits are u18s, excessive pain, non-con and skat/watersports.

I try to respond at least once per day, although sometimes real life will get in the way. I write in the first person present, and generally try to write detail, liking around 3 paragraphs per response (although of course that fluctuates). I'm looking for a partner who appreciates detail, and who really likes to develop their characters. In your response, I'd like you to include a little bit about your character, your kinks, and how you imagine this RP developing. Please include a decent amount of detail in your response, just so I can gauge whether we'd work together. I usually leave prompts up a little while before replying, so don't feel the need to rush your response. I'll try and reply to everyone, but short and undetailed messages probably won't get a response.

N.B. and basically all of my past prompts along a similar theme are open too if they take your fancy!"

   * Various animal whistles and calls.
   * Handcuffs.
   * First aid kit.
   * Stun gun.
* **Name of their quirk:** Assist
* **Quirk Type:** Emitter
* **Quirk Range:** 6 meters
* **Quirk Description:** By keeping his hands clasped together and staying within range, he can choose to increase three of the following attributes of a single person: Muscle Strength, Physical Endurance, Mental Aptitude, Sensory Perception, and Confidence. The effectiveness of his quirk is determined by the emotional bond between him and the target, with strangers getting no noticeable effect and close loved ones getting a maximum possible 200% boost.
* **Miscellaneous Quirk Info:** 
   * When he was younger, he had to stay still to use the quirk, but now he has learned to move while using it, although doing so does decrease it's effectiveness.
   * In case it isn't clear, here are some example uses for boosting each attribute.
      * Muscle Strength: attack harder (physically), lift and carry greater weight, run faster, jump higher, etc.
      * Physical Endurance: greater stamina, resist physical damage, slightly higher pain tolerance.
      * Mental Aptitude: Increase both efficiency and speed of thought. Cannot increase memory storage, but can improve memory recall. Lessens chance of sensory overload from boosting perception.
      * Sensory Perception: Increases sensitivity of the five main senses, seeing clearer, hearing softer sounds, feeling fainter differences in touch, more easily distinguishing differences in taste, stronger sense of smell. Essentially, this minutely decreases the JNDs for using these senses. Can cause sensory overload with targets who are not used to it.
      * Confidence: This is the simplest to understand. Decreases anxiety, and increases willingness to take risks.
   * Oscar's quirk is a combination of his parent's quirks, and is different from the quirks of his sister. The part where Oscar has to clasp his hands together is a unique mutation of the quirks.
      * Father: A transformation type quirk that boosts all physical abilities as long as he holds his breath.
      * Mother: An emitter type that boosts the mental faculties of anyone she touches.
      * Older Sister: A transformation type quirk that helps her not get distracted when she holds her breath.
* **Quirk Strengths:**
   * Versatile
   * Great in a team
* **Quirk Weaknesses:**
   * Quirk occupies his hands
   * Consumes energy
   * Requires ally
   * Makes the user an easier target during combat.
* **Special Moves:**
   * Specialize: Boosts 2 attributes instead of 3. This makes each boost stronger, making the maximum boost 225%. This strains energy, and can only be maintained for a maximum of 5 minutes, after which Buffer won't be able to use his quirk for around 5-10 minutes. This is the only special move that is regularly helpful in battle, since increasing a person’s strength without increasing the endurance as well can lead to attacks causing self-damage. That and this is the only special move that leaves buffer with the ability to flee if needed.
   * Expertise: Boost a single attribute instead of 3. This makes that single boost stronger, making the new maximum boost 300%. This is a heavy strain, only lasting 60 seconds before Buffer becomes unable to walk for several minutes. Not particularly useful in battle. Best used to increase perception or intelligence when conducting investigation on a severe time-crunch, or to increase confidence during training, negotiations, or public appearances.
   * ALL OR NOTHING: Boost a single attribute by 900%, no matter the level of emotional bond, for 2 seconds. Lose consciousness for several hours immediately afterwards. Should NEVER be used to boost strength, unless the target fully understands the implications and is willing to pay the price, as the chance of injury is guaranteed and chance of death is great. Best used to boost endurance so a target can tank a single hit guaranteed. A last resort technique. Barely used.
* **Personal Strengths:**
   * Very cooperative.
   * Tries to help often.
   * Very sociable.
* **Personal Weaknesses:**
   * Forgetful
   * Distractable
* **Age quirk obtained:** 6
* **How the quirk was obtained:** Natural
* **Likes:** Animals, RPGs, spicy food.
* **Dislikes:** Being late, being mocked.
* **Habits:**
   * Going off on tangents
   * Repeating himself or stuttering in casual conversation.
* **Fears:** Failure
* **Reason for becoming a Hero/Villain:** ""What else could somebody like me do?""
* **Relationship with peers/classmates:** Not a popular kid, but had plenty of friends.
* **Relationship with Family:** Healthy, but he isn't exactly a family man
* **Relationship Status:** Single
* **Number of Kids:** 0
* **Art (if any):** Sorry, I can't draw.

Ik heb een vraagje.

Ik studeer op dit moment IBMS en ben bijna klaar met mijn opleiding. Ik werk nu parttime bij een marketing bureau maar wil liever werken als programmeur. Ik heb meer plezier in programmeren en wil daarmee aan de slag. Ik wil mijn focus leggen op web development, specifiek front end development. Ik heb HTML, CSS, Git en GitHub al aardig onder de knie en ken de basis van JS. Ik spendeer zo een beetje bijna al mijn vrije tijd aan het leren van programmeren. Daarnaast werk ik aan de curriculum van freecodecamp.com en werk aan projecten die ik in mijn portfolio kan zetten.

Echter ik vroeg mij af hoe reëel mijn kansen zijn. Ik heb geen relevante werkervaring in IT en ook geen relevant ICT opleiding. Ik zag wel verschillende traineeships van bedrijven als Calco en Young Capital waar ze je wel intern opleiden tot IT'er en daarna aan de slag kunt bij een opdrachtgever.

Ik vroeg mij af of jullie advies/tips hebben voor me."

I'm 25, blonde, and am starting to get some muscle on me but live in a small city. Yesterday I got showered real good and took out a butt plug, lubed my hole and started playing with my ass. I opened grindr expecting to see the same 12 faces on the screen. Instead there was a new one, a 42 year old white guy with a hiv status of neg, on prep. I know from his distance that he is staying at the hotel half a mile away.   

Normally I stick to guys around my age but I was real horny. I sent him a message and he wrote back immediately. I asked him what he was doing and he said honestly he was jerking off. i laughed and said I was doing the same. He sent a couple of pictures and he was just an average mid 40s white guy but then he sent a dick pick and it was beautiful. Over eight inches, straight and looked thick. I asked if he wanted help jerking off and he sent his hotel room. Perfect. In less than two minutes I got a hookup.  

I kept in my butt plug in my hole and got in my car and drove over. I knocked on his door and he looked like his pictures, a mid 40s white guy with a dadbod. He was naked and my eyes went straight to his dick. it was just as beautiful in person. I got on my knees right there in the hallway and started blowing him. I couldn't get more than half of it in my mouth until I was gagging and my eyes were watering. It was just too big. I needed it in my hole. It was probably 9 inches and really thick like a coke can.  

I stood up and took off all my clothes. He ran a hand down my back and saw I had a butt plug in and his eyes got wide and he asked if I wanted fucked. I told him I hadn't taken a dick that big but I wanted to try. He smiled and I asked him to get on his back so I could control getting his dick in me.  

I grabbed lube, poppers and magnum condoms before going out of the house and I got them from my shorts on the floor and I put on the bed. I took out the butt plug and started to lube up my hole.  He laid down on the bed and I took a hit of poppers and started rubbing his bare dick on my hole. I could feel it stretching my hole out and I started to moan real loudly. I lubed his dick up and put more lube on my hole. He asked about the condom and I told him let me get him all the way in first. I took another hit of poppers and slowly started getting his dick in me. I got his head in, but had to wait for awhile. I could feel him flexing his head and it made me more horny. I took more poppers and this time made it about halfway before I had to stop. I stayed right there for about a full minute. I could feel his hard dick in me and it was really stretching me out. I took more poppers again and this time slid all the way down.   

My ass has never felt so full.  

I stayed there for a little bit, took more poppers and started to slowly ride his dick. I felt I needed more lube so pulled all the way off of him, lubed him up again and got on my knees and bent over so my ass was up on the bed. I told him to go slow. He asked if I wanted that condom and I told him to just fuck me. He slid in. Jesus he was big. I told him to go slow, and he did. I could feel him pulling almost all the way out and then slowly going all the way back in. 

I am not a size queen but damn his dick felt real good in me. I told him a couple of times to go slower as I couldn't take it hard or rough, and he just kept up a slow steady pace that every time grazed over my prostate and made me moan really hard. I had to bite down on a pillow so I wasn't too loud.

He fucked me for fifteen minutes like that. My back and legs were starting to shake in this position but it felt so good I didn't want to change anything so I just kept right there. I reached down and felt my dick and it was soft as all the feeling was in my prostate and ass. It felt so good. The guy really knew what he was doing too and made sure that any time he heard me moan that he kept doing just that. I felt my hole opening up more and he was able to go faster. The combinations of poppers, his fucking and his pre-cum just really made my ass open up.   

I could hear his breathing change and I knew that he was getting close. I wanted his cum in my hole. I could feel him speeding up and then he started to groan. He didn't say anything about him getting close but I knew he was. His grip on my hips got tighter and he pushed all the way in me and groaned really loud. I could feel my hole getting warmer and knew he had cum in me. That he didn't tell me he was going to cum made it even hotter.   

He kept fucking for another minute and I could feel his dick getting softer. He pulled out and told me to flip over and jerk off. I did, and immediately my hand went down to what feels like a bruised hole. I have never felt my hole so open and my soft dick got real hard when I put a finger in my hole. I could feel his cum in my open hole and it only took a few jerks before I came a huge load all over me.   

He smiled and handed me back my butt plug and told me to put it in so the cum didn't spill out. I did, got dressed and drove the rest of the way home. He sent a message on grindr that he comes to my city once every three months and he needed my number so he could text me. When I got home, I had to jerk off again.  

I'm sitting at work today and I can still feel his dick in my hole. "

Instead, I'm now feeling quite pleased with the devs, and thinking maybe I'll get some of the new purchasable suits, to offer them some carrots along with the threat of my stick.

So what suits are coming for purchase? A new suit, Intern Miko, the return of the Chinese Opera pack, and two more returning suits **that I missed during the firework festival boycott**, Alice's Time Gate and Clover's Ceremony! I don't know if the devs were smart enough to pick these two intentionally, or if they just fell at the right part of the return cycle, but this seems like a great opportunity for some of us to demonstrate we are not only willing to spend on this game, but are willing to buy the **exact same suits** we ignored, as long as the devs are treating us decently.

I'm interested to hear what other players think of this development. Do you think this timing was an intentional experiment or second chance from the devs? Are you planning on buying these two outfits, either to make a point or because you wanted to buy them during the boycott but couldn't?"

99gxev,3,2018-08-22,Career Outlook After College. Looking for feedback,Zuberambert,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/99gxev/career_outlook_after_college_looking_for_feedback/,"I am looking for some advice for what to do to get a job when I graduate college. Here is an overview of my college timeline:

I am graduating college at the end of this year in May 2019. I came into college with over 60 credits from taking AP and college classes in high school. I came in as an undecided student for my freshman year in 2016. Last year I declared as an Actuarial Science-Mathematics major with a computer science minor. It will only have taken me 3 years to graduate to keep college costs low. 

Unfortunately, this puts me at a disadvantage coming out of college because I will not have as much time to take the exams and have internships before I graduate. I have passed exam P/1 and I am taking FM/2 in the spring of this year. When I graduate I will have the two exams passed (possibly 3) and I will not have had an internship. I had to turn down an internship this last summer ( it's a long story but I interviewed for a full time internship but then when they offered it to me they changed it to part time to hire more people) to work full time to pay for school. I am working in college for the math department. I tried to find an internship around my school but it is a small city and there wasn't any offerings for the school year, only summer. Working for the math dept. is the only relevant job I have had relating to being an actuary.

&amp;#x200B;

What can I do to improve my chances of getting a job out of college? Should I talk to a career adviser?

Any suggestions on the types of things that I can be doing now to improve my chances?

I am looking for some feedback and other peoples thoughts about my situation.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR- Will be graduating in May 2019 with 2-3 exams passed and probably no internship, looking for feedback about my current situation.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me know too if you are in a similar position and this thread could help future people like us."

99hv03,0,2018-08-22,Looking for the best way to use $40k-$60k When I graduate in 2 years,ExtremeSalamander,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/99hv03/looking_for_the_best_way_to_use_40k60k_when_i/,"Hey everyone, 

I will be graduating college in about 2 years with a BS/MS degree (Machine Learning) and have a few offers to be a software engineer at some big companies and with great pay. I was lucky enough to get some high paying internships throughout my degree and plan to have a minimum of 40-60k saved. Now I am looking for the best way to use that when I graduate. I will have around 30k in student loans.

Currently I have about 7-8k invested in some long term dividend stocks, use about $1k as ""swing trading"" money (trying to learn a good strategy anyone know great resources?) and keep the rest in savings ( I know this is not the best and has very little return) to pay rent and every day life. Overall I am extremely frugal and have been pretty good at only spending money on essentials throughout college and plan to keep this up even with a high paying job out of college to try and give myself the best starting point in ""real life"". 

&amp;#x200B;

Some ideas that I am weighing are: 

1. Investing in a Roth IRA - downside being that one of my job offers will put me out of the contribution range which means that I could be putting 5500 - 11000 into an untouchable account that I can't (or shouldn't) touch until I retire. Should an unforeseen life even happen that I  need that money, I will need to withdraw with significant penalties.

2. Using the money on a down payment on a house upon graduation. - downside being that it would ""wipe out"" my savings and have it all tied up in that asset instead of diversifying.

3. Instead of buying a house to live in, live at home for 1 - 2 years and save all the money I will be making, then using that to buy a rental property in a great area - downside being the high risk and load of additional work that is associated with running a rental.

4. Using the money to pay off the full amount of student loans - downside being that I know that if I invest this instead, the around 300 a month I would end up paying would have a far greater return over time and 300 a month will not be that much of an issue with a high paying salary even though I know much of that is interest.

From these vote tallies, that democrats opposed both the TPP/TTIP seems rather obvious. Indeed, Obama's main legislative collaborators for his trade bills were republicans, meaning he couldn't rely upon his own party for support. Drawing a parallel to the NAFTA vote - just as it was then, a majority of democrats in both houses voted against the trade bill ([https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/103-1993/h575](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/103-1993/h575) , [https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/103-1993/s395](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/103-1993/s395)). To drive my point home lets just look at the nay votes for the past 4 free trade agreements the US joined. Each passed with the opposition consisting of democrats by a vast majority.

​

**South Korea Trade Deal**

​

SEN/HOUSE nays: DEMS (14/130), REP (1/21)

​

**Colombia Free Trade Deal**

​

SEN/HOUSE nays:  DEMS (30/158), REP(2/9)

​

**Panama Free Trade Deal**

​

SEN/HOUSE nays: DEMS (21/123), REP (0/6)

​

**Dominican Republic–Central America Free Trade Agreement**

​

SEN/HOUSE nays: DEMS (33/187), REP (12/27)

​

As we can see, democrats outnumber republicans in opposition to free trade by a hilariously large margin. As a thought experience if we suppose that the GOP vanished and all Democratic congressmen and senators maintained their positions, none of our recent free trade agreements would have passed. Not a single one. Whereas, reversing the experiment yields additional free trade agreements which have failed. I could not find a single instance during the past 30 years in which a majority of house democrats have voted for any trade bill. When we discard the rhetoric and get down to brass tacks - the democratic voting record on free trade is abysmal. They are completely and totally outclassed by the GOP in this metric. If we only base our conclusions on hard evidence - concrete vote tallies, then there simply is no competition. As our vote tallies have just shown (in addition to the preceding thought experiment), the opposition to free trade, as a significant force, exists only insofar as the democratic party exists within the houses of congress.

Morning - supposed to help the group at school but I woke up at 13:00 so I didn't go. Not like I wouldn't gone if I were on time.

Midday - Playing drums, chilling. Calling potential internships, being denied by all of them, again. How demotivating. Calling and just knowing you're getting denied. Made me throw my phone away after the conversation, it was getting frustrating. I am qualified, have plenty of experience and good grades. Don't I deserve this?

Evening - Playing some sports with roommates. Frisbee was boring, enjoyed playing with the american football, more energetic. Having a couple beers with Ilse, witch was fun.

TRANSLATE YOUR EMOTIONS PLEASE
-
In the evening Ilse asked if I would you like to come over for boozes. She didn't ask the others? Makes me wonder what she sees in me? Am I a romantic option for her, or just a good friend? Either way, despite going in with doubts we actually had a lot of fun just talking. We talked about romantic options, and how she had a crush on someone I knew. Of course I knew who and said so, she is quite obvious in how she shows it. Reminds me of a night when a friend told me she was obviously in to me. I shrugged it off and said she just talked and danced with me because I'm her friend.

All in all I do not wish to pursue a further relation with her. Being a friend like today was good enough. Talking without there being some sort of pressure is more fun.


**22 august 2018**

morning - like I wasn't sleeping

midday - waking up playing some drums, made some real progress with the song. Doing volunteer work for refugees, cooking. Had a lot of fun with Lou and Maxime. Didn't expect that I would click with them that well. We made plans to walk the airborne route on 1 september together just the three of us. Usually I don't stay too long, but today I had a lot of fun talking, even stayed for some coffee.

evening - chilling, listening to music. And as I am writing this agreeing to go out with friends and some other people, we'll see how it goes. I'm going on bike so I can leave early if I like.

EDIT * 

OUT, AND WITHOUT
-
So I went out and yeah it was fun. Could I take the night away if I could: yes absolutely. I've made dumb mistakes, seen people make dumb mistakes. No progression at all. Empty, hollow interactions.

The mistake if made? Yeah I grabbed a friends between his legs with both hands and lifted him up. Absolutely moronic. I instantly felt shitty. As reconciliation I gave him my apologies and asked if he wanted to hit me as hard as he could. So he hit me between my lungs at my rib cage, it hurt, a lot. But I guess I deserved it, gave him my apologies more, saying that was a stupid mistake I made, yet I still feel stupid, that is not me. How can I be like this?

The things I have seen. Lighthearted when you see it then. But now afterwards it breaks me down. Seeing people dance absolutely crazy, knocking people down. Seeing someone grind my friend unsolicited by an older man. She asked for help, at first I didn't understand her, but then I saw the hands around her. The old man grabbing her from behind. I took her hands and dragged her away. It makes me remember what Lou said this midday. About how at work men say and do sexual intimidating things. And how it happens often, it is sickening.

So yeah overal this was a good day. Had fun making playing music. Had a lot of fun doing volunteer work, meeting new people and talking with them. And talking with Lou and Maxime. ~~9/10~~. But going out worsened it. Maybe it is because i'm a bit drunk and tired. But I know this night is going to haunt me. *7.5/10*

Up to this point in my life, I have tried teaching and hated it, partially due to the struggles of my anxiety, and have since been employed as a paraprofessional for about 2.5 years. I mostly work with kids who have horrible home lives and are behind academically in one way or another. I can really relate to them as I struggled a lot when I was younger. It is the only job that has seemed to work with my anxiety and bipolar but I am very underpaid and, in relation to my education level, underemployed. 

Over the summer, I did an internship at an art museum. Long story short, my supervisor is resigning and I interviewed for her job Friday. This museum really loved me and wants to hire me. I would make much more money (comparatively), be using my Master's degree, and be involved in the visual arts which has always been a goal and dream for me.

Problem is, I feel anxious about accepting the role. I would be in charge of volunteer recruitment and management as well as organizing and planning events. In my head, I keep envisioning forgetting some detail and causing the entire event to be ruined. Or being so bad at my job that I am fired and then become homeless.

I know it is crazy sounding but the fear is very real for me. On top of that, I feel horribly guilty for leaving my friends at my current job.

I've failed a few semesters now by failing to remember content and not having the greatest grasp in Calculus, even with tutoring, and I just feel absolutely useless, plus the costs were adding up to my debt. Sometimes I feel like my work ethic makes up for it but my experience compared to a 30 year old simply doesn't compare. (like, if some late 20 year old web dev from Texas can end up homeless here...)

I have a friend who wants to house me in DC for about a month free but longer with rent if I manage to score a job there, but I'm also being pulled by my friends and my family to stay here and I hate to say it but I feel like a pussy now. I can't tell if I'm missing something outside of being inexperienced here, I can't even tell if I'm experienced for *outside* of California, if I'm overreacting (I don't know what to do about money!!), or if I'm not taking enough initiative with myself.

What do I do? I feel miserable, nothing feels like things are for me here, I don't know how to be a college student and I don't know how to get hired here but everyone keeps convincing me there's 'something', I'm just terrible with people so working service is a death wish (I did it before, it didn't go well at all), it generally feels like a complete dead end

Sorry for the dumb rant but I genuinely don't have anyone else to turn to but this subreddit, none of my friends (almost all over 25) has no idea what to do about me and I feel like an absolute burden at this point"

A little about me and my personality. So I'm in my late 20s. I studied engineering and worked at some IT companies. I consider myself an introvert person, I have some self esteem issues for having a really heavy acne problem back in highschool. Somehow it's easy for me to make friends once I get used to a person but I'm never the one to take the first step, also alcohol makes me kinda extroverted. Most of my closest friends I know since elementary school anyway and usually I'm the center of attention. It's wierd I know.

Well last year I was about to leave my country to study abroad. I had said my goodbyes had a big farewell party etc. But in the last second I got a panic attack and decided to stay and try something different for a year. At that time some of my friends were really worried about me and I told them I was fine I just needed some time for myself. Suddenly some of my closest friends stopped talking to me as much as we used to. I didn't really minded at the time but it gave me time to gather myself.

I decided I wanted to give cooking a try. I have been always good at it and a family member has a restaurant. He gave me the chance to intern at his business. I started as a waiter and through the year I learned the different parts of the restaurant business. Still it was a very different kind of job as I was used to. 6 days a week and being on my feet for 7+ hours. When I got home all I wanted was to sleep and on my free day I just wanted time for myself. Obviously I stopped seeing some of my friends and canceling on some social gatherings. Some of my friends simply stopped talking to me.

3 weeks ago one of my closest friends wrote me that she felt abandoned and I told her that I was not abandoning anyone but that it was a very demanding job and the hours were hard on my body (I lost about 22 pounds since I started working in the restaurant and I have always been kinda skinny) and that if I was not eager to go out was because I rather have some down time. She plainly stopped talking to me and I only knew she was mad because a friend in common told me she was. At that point I was fed up and decided to do nothing because I was having a hard time at work. 2 weeks ago I quitted my job at the restaurant ant because of many reasons. The day I quitted I wanted to see my friends but most of them simply ignored me. Just my best friend came. A couple of days after my friend wanted to see me but her girlfriend is friends with the girl that got mad at me and we couldn't see each other. It's been actually hard to see my friend because they spend more time with her and she dosent want to see me.

Tonight I realized that people tend to do that to me. Just plainly stop talking to me. No reason no argument just silence. And I instead of confronting them I'd rather look away and pretend I don't care. 

I know it's kinda selfish to not want to socialize but it's how I am. Most of the time I'd rather stay and play videogames than go out drinking or whatever out of my confort zone. I don't understand why they got mad at me when I rather spend some time alone, they usually go and talk to other people. About their problems (many times it was me since I am a good listener) but I don't need that shit happens. But the days I'd like to see my friends or just hang it's hard when I feel nobody likes me anymore for not being whiny enough.

Am I wrong. Should I apologize to all of them for ""disappearing""?
I kinda feel like I'm a toxic person when all I wanted was time for myself..."

The company I intern at didn’t really invest in much effort in training me, I had to try and learn things by myself, which is fine but that took time. The company would get really mad whenever I made a mistake or took too long on an assignment (even literally within two hours into my first day). I just took it when they yelled at me or questioned me intensively, but sometimes it would be a mistake made by someone else and I would just take the blame. This experience had my really doubting whether or not I will be an honorable civil engineer and has really made me hate civil engineering. I recently graduated last May and this was my first internship. I guess my question is are all companies like this? Do companies seriously just care about budgets and resources? Will it get better?

99ksaa,50,2018-08-23,I (23/F) finally sucked off my anime-loving programming instructor (early 30s/M),FreeuseFuckslutYuri,stupidslutsclub,https://www.reddit.com/r/stupidslutsclub/comments/99ksaa/i_23f_finally_sucked_off_my_animeloving/,"Hello fellow pervs and sluts~  This is my first time posting here, but if you’re on the discord server, I’m yuripiano in there :D also, I apologize for typos - I’m on mobile, and autocorrect does strange things sometimes...

Anyway, I just got back home from my instructor’s house (which happens to be only 4 minutes away from my place lol), and I wanted to share what happened~

So, when I first saw my instructor, I could immediately tell he was... um... quirky? He had a sort of awkward laugh and was very into nerdy things that I also enjoyed, like Touhou and anime in general. When he would teach, he would often use anime characters as examples, and I knew we could get along well.  

As the weeks flew by, I liked him more and more, until one thing lead to another and I found myself masturbating one night while imagining him with his cock down my throat. 

But, who says you should let your dreams be dreams? 

Fast forward a few months to yesterday. I recently got hired for an internship (yay!) and would be moving in a few days, so I knew if I wanted to make this happen, I would have to do it soon... so, I invited him out to dinner, and he agreed for today.

We went out tonight for some pretty good shabu shabu, and I started teasing him asking about some of his tastes and kinks (we... had discussed this before in small bits, but never as the like... focal point of a conversation). He told me some things I didn’t know, namely that he had a diaper fetish, which I’m personally not much into, but hey, my tastes are *way* more extreme, so I would never judge. After we ate, I worked up the courage and asked if he could show me his figurines at his place (he’s a huge weeb with literally 6 *terabytes* of anime downloaded) and maybe watch anime at his place, and he seemed suuuuper nervous but said okay, which made me giggle (half in amusement at his nervousness, half because of my own nervousness).

We watched a few episodes of things like Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid (which he claimed was relevant because the main character is apparently a python programmer) before I started asking him more about his tastes in hentai while I was showing him pictures I liked on my phone. After a few episodes, we transitioned to him showing me his extensive hentai collection as well, and I was sitting on the couch with my head against his shoulder, but he wasn’t... *doing* anything, even while I was trying to hint by saying “Oh, that’s super hot” and “that’s a turn on, haha~”

I was leaning against him on the couch and he was holding a keyboard in his hands the whole time, with me on his left, and I had no access to his crotch and was getting *super* horny at this point. My hand was aimlessly gliding up and down his jeans and my cheek was rubbing against him, but he still wasn’t taking the bait...

So, I finally took his left hand and put it on my head, asking for head pats and I told him his hand was in the way of what I *really* wanted...

... but I was still nervous since he wasn’t making any moves, so I waited another 30 minutes before finally reaching for his crotch... at which point he (very embarrassedly) told me that the diaper fetish hentai he looked at extended into irl too, and he showed me his diapers he was wearing (which was kinda cute, even though I’m not really into it). He guided my hand a bit against them, and I could sort of feel his hard cock under them, but ultimately, they were in the way, and I patted his cock through them and told him take them off~

He left for a minute to take them off and when he came back, we watched more hentai while I stroked him... but I wanted to suck it, and given the angle and the bend of his thick cock, it just... didn’t lend itself to that.  

It felt so warm in my hand, and the scent and the feel of it throbbing against my fingers was driving my wild at this point.
So, I did the only thing natural at this point.

I eventually sank to my knees on the ground between his and sucked him off while he watched an arousing incest hentai, speeding up and deep throating at appropriate times (based on the hentai sounds). His shaft was thick and filled my mouth soooo nicely, and his tip was considerably larger (and squishier!) than anyone else’s that I’ve had the privilege of taking into my slutty mouth.  

After a few minutes of working his cock in my mouth, he gave me... maybe 3 seconds of warning before he came~  it was suuuuper tasty and a bit sweeter than most cum I’ve had, and I savored every drop that came out~  

I... may also have been cum starved... but it was tasty anyway!  So, I waited a few moments to make sure he got it all out, carefully squeezing and whatnot to milk it all into my mouth before swallowing.

And then I figured he would like this since he was such a weeb... I looked up at him, clapped my hands together, tilted my head, smiled, and said *gochisousamadeshita~* (which is like “thanks for the meal~”)
... I should have added an *onii-chan* onto the end of it, but oh well....

After that, we cuddled a few minutes before he drove me home (even though it was only a few minutes away), and when I got out of his car, I told him “Thank you for the meal! And thank you for dinner as well~” before telling him I’d see him tomorrow, hehe~ 

And now I’m here! Typing this up while all but dying of my own arousal, lying in bed with a tummy full of tasty cum~ 
... and shabu shabu. Very, very tasty shabu shabu.

(He also gave me a pair of his favorite diapers to try on if I ever want to, even though I’m not much into that... but who knows, maybe I’ll try them and like it or something hahaha)

Thanks for reading~  
Oh, and feel free to add me on discord if you’re on it - I love making new friends~!  &lt;3"

I went into vet school loving ER and wanting to be a criticalist. I’ve let go of my desire to do a residency. The last 3 months on as an ER vet, I’ve really been struggling. I was comfortable as an intern and do well when I can bounce ideas off senior clinicians but I feel like techs don’t respect me, still see me as an intern, and some definitely don’t find me an intelligent or competent doctor especially when I’m the solo doctor on. Obviously, burn out, depression, and anxiety all play a role in why I’m not good enough but I just find being an attending doesn’t come as naturally as being a tech did. I miss things, make mistakes, and just am not strong yet. 

For those that went into ER either post-internship or immediately after school, how long did it take you to get the hang of things? What tips do you have?"

I take sertraline and it has helped leaps and bounds for school, family, socializing, and every day living. But I started my internship and school started back up at the same time and I can't sleep.

Tonight I had a severe anxiety attack and couldn't breathe and was shaking and crying. I'm exhausted and I have class in a few hours and work tomorrow. Nyquil usually knocks me right out when I can't sleep but I haven't used it because I don't want to HAVE to use it if I get dependent on it.

99ltp4,1,2018-08-23,We were supposed to get married...,Throwaway_7ate9,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/99ltp4/we_were_supposed_to_get_married/,"I met this girl while picking up her roommate for a date about 8 years ago. Things never went anywhere with the roommate, but we all stayed friends on social media and we eventually started talking a few years later. I'd wanted to be with her since the day I met her, but I was shy and afraid of rejection and she ended up dating someone else for three years. Almost immediately after that relationship ended, we started dating. She made the first move, and I was happier than I'd ever been. Six months later she's moved to another city 1.5hrs away for school, and we only saw each other on weekends. After a while she's starting to hate her job and decides to change her major again and practically start over, piling on more student loan debt and stress. I kept telling myself that things were okay between us, even though every time I visited her we argued half the time. This went on for about 1.5 years. I'd convinced myself that all of this was normal, that no relationship was perfect and we'd work on our issues when she finished school and moved in with me and had more time to sit down and talk in the same room. 
Then she convinced me that if we were in a committed relationship then we might as well be married. She pressured me to propose for a few months and I begged her to stop, but eventually I convinced myself that I was as ready as I'd ever be and I bought a ring. She moved back home (other side of the country) for the six months leading up to the wedding to work on planning it and working with vendors and she stayed with her parents through that time. And that's when everything went to shit. 
She was taking online classes while working part time and planning a wedding and it was a lot of stress for her, especially while living at home with her parents who couldn't stop bickering about every little thing. For the first five of those six months, she slowly nose-dived into a pit of anxiety and depression and refused to tell me about any of it. I knew something was wrong and I asked her about it constantly but she'd always tell me she was fine. I stopped trusting myself but kept asking her about it. About three months in, she admitted that she didn't feel close to me anymore, but I was determined to win her back. I loved her more than anything but I wasn't getting any love back. She blamed me and my anxiety and insecurities for pushing her away (issues I didn't really have in this context before all of this) But I didn't want to give up on her. After five months, she finally admitted that it wasn't just me, she admitted to her nosedive and we agreed that it wasn't a good time to get married. A week later, she told me that she finally agreed to call off the wedding because she didn't have the same desire to fix things that I had... She basically told me that she'd already given up on the relationship at that point, and that's what broke me. 
We tried to make it work for several more months and things were great for a few weeks after calling off the wedding, but she took an internship in another state instead of moving in with me or at least nearby again, and everything quickly went back to shit. She was working long hours and any time I tried to talk about things that bothered me in our relationship, she belittled my problems and made it out to be my fault again. I waited it out for a few months before finally deciding I couldn't take it anymore and I broke up with her. I couldn't handle being told everything was my fault, that all my problems weren't that bad compared to hers, and that I was constantly overreacting to everything. 
I hate that I hurt her. I think she was really blindsided by the breakup and horribly hurt by it. She would've finally moved in with me a couple weeks later but I just couldn't do it anymore. I wanted to wait for her to move back but I felt like I was leading her on and hated myself for it. We haven't talked much since then, which has been good. After the breakup, I felt a huge weight lifted off my shoulders and I felt great. I deleted all her friends and family off all social media, but for some reason decided to keep her. It's been about 4 months now, and I keep thinking I want to move on and find someone new, but I also wonder if I'll just project that crap on a new partner. All my insecurities are going to come creeping out and I'll ruin something good before it even gets going. I wonder if I can really be ready to move on if I compare all the women I meet to my ex. I don't understand how to gauge my own readiness to move on...


TL;DR: My fiancee treated me like an afterthought for almost a year, I broke up with her, and now I'm struggling to move on, even though I'm happy to be out of a toxic relationship. 

Edit: I have a bad habit of making it sound like it was entirely her fault, but there were destructive behaviors on both our parts. I was angry and petty in response to her behavior, like if she'd respond in nothing but one-word texts, I'd do the same hoping she'd notice and feel bad and apologize and make an attempt to communicate better. It never worked and if anything it just worsened the divide between us."
99mfh3,1,2018-08-23,SEO Training Institute in Bangalore,chandruu9,u_chandruu9,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_chandruu9/comments/99mfh3/seo_training_institute_in_bangalore/,"  I wanted to gain expertise in SEO skills and techniques and started to look out for the Best [**SEO institute in Bangalore**](http://www.digitalacademy360.com/seo-training-institute-in-bangalore.html)**.** In order to make a right decision, I explored on the factors that can be considered before choosing the SEO course and Institute.

It is an ideal practice to check the SEO course outline in order to acquire the desired skills to equip you to work in SEO projects. The Course must have SEO practical sessions and simulated versions so that the students can understand better. The students must be given a chance to create and optimize their own website so that they understand the importance of SEO.

**SEO Training methods and Teaching Approach**

It is better to check out for institutes which can offer SEO training with an objective for enhancing the career of students. The key is to look out for institutes which has minimum batch size so that the interaction between student and faculty becomes easy. The approach of the institute should facilitate and promote one to one attention for each trainee by providing backup classes.

Before joining the SEO course, it is better to do an analysis and a background check of the institute. The factors to be considered are the reason for students choosing the institute, the age of the institute, the training classrooms and tools. Please ensure that you compare the SEO institutes and courses on the same parameters.

**Fees structure**

Update from my post yesterday. I have secured the internship (received the phone call today) and I will be relocating and starting early September. As previously stated, the loan is to pay the **security deposit and first month's rent** in advance.

I will be **earning a monthly salary** which will be used to **repay the loan in full with interest**. I am open to negotiating the monthly repayments, my prefered repayment is as follows:

I’ve had my fair share of creeps but this one definitely wins as the worst... (very long...)

I was moving to another city to start a summer internship during my first year of university. After looking at a few places, I decided to go for an international flat share with other people around my age. I was sharing a flat with 5 other people from all over the world, everyone seemed pretty nice at first. 

There was this one guy though who was a little off... he was over 6FT and quite overweight... seemed at first like a gentle giant but that opinion quickly changed. 

Things started to get weird when the “gentle giant” would be in the kitchen every single night when I got home from work and would just sit and watch me having dinner... it went from just watching to then buying me cakes every day... I would always reject them but he would insist and put them in the fridge for later. After a while he told me he thought I had lost weight and wanted me to look as ‘perfect’ as I was when I viewed the flat (first red flag).

I started to come home from work later and later to try and avoid him, but he would always wait for me in the kitchen. He would make conversation about his home country (Pakistan), speaking about how the town he was from was badly bombed. When I told him I was sorry he had to go through that he responded with some pretty creepy terrorist sympathising comments... (second red flag).

One evening I came home and he was on skype with his family. Turns out his mother was trying to get him to agree on a bride for his arranged marriage but he was protesting against all of them. The following day he came to me and said he told his mother he had found a bride in the UK, and it was me... he wanted me to convert to islam and be his wife?!? I obviously rejected that offer and told him I was absolutely not interested... 

Cue the stalking... he would mysteriously be outside my internship as I was finishing, in the supermarket at the same time as me or on the same bus in the morning (we worked on opposite sides of the city). 

I moved out of the flat a little bit after all this and went back home, hundreds of miles away, Feeling very glad to be away from him. But that wasn’t the end... I was bombarded by creepy messages every day asking how I was and where I was... telling me he loved me and wanted to be with me forever. I ignored every single message from him until one day he sent me a picture of himself next to a road sign pretty close to my city... this went on for a few days, sending pictures of landmarks etc. I was completely freaked out feeling pretty certain this guy was going to hunt me down and make me his wife. 

After another string of abusive messages my friend replies to him pretending to be my boyfriend and that he should leave me alone. The “gentle giant” responds with, “I will ruin both of your lives. I will give you bloody dickhead and bloody asshole. I will smash your back doors in” Lovely... the messages continue like this for a few days before I finally block his number. I got phone calls and texts from random numbers for weeks after that, still claiming to be near my city and knowing where I was... I  blocked each number and then things suddenly went silent. 

I didn’t hear anything from him for a solid year before the messages picked up again, then stopped as randomly as they started. This is now 5 years on and I still get messages out of the blue about being in love with me from random numbers/Facebook accounts saying it’s him.

Not so gentle giant, let’s never meet again... 

TLDR; 
“Gentle giant” wants to make me convert to islam and become his wife, stalks me and then vanishes."

Last night, I saw a post on Instagram from a girl I know that my friends is really close with. It was a long winded post about how Amazing her day was because how things have been awful for her, being lonely, things going wrong, etc. 

I was just so confused because this girl had 200-300+ likes in hours, goes out to bars, and the guy friends that go with her buy all her drinks.

99nms5,2,2018-08-23,I (22M) am ending my first serious relationship and want to keep it as amicable as possible with my ex (24F)- any advice?,Bosscroft,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/99nms5/i_22m_am_ending_my_first_serious_relationship_and/,"**Background**: My girlfriend/ex (not entirely sure which is most suitable at this point) and I have known each other for 3 years, in a relationship for 2 1/2 of that. When we met I was very athletic and had good self confidence, she was even more outgoing- grew up in the Netherlands so loved a good rave and meeting people. Met in her final year of uni, she has been graduated for 2 years, living in London. I am still at uni, just finished an internship in London. We have had a very good relationship in terms of support and communication. Actively involved in her family and activities and vice versa, have discussed our potential future together at length, marriage and beyond. I am going back to uni for my final year in October.

**Development**: Issues have been developing for a while, mostly to do with health issues I have been having, most notably IBS, depression and chronic fatigue (fun pick'n'mix right?). As my health deteriorated we made adjustments to our routines, she went out with friends without me sometimes and we were happy with that, then she graduated so we were mainly limited to seeing each other on weekends but all seemed fine. 

When we were both working in London last year everything was great, until she admitted she had got with a guy in a club just before we started officially going out- this really messed with me as she had always been very strict about cheating (if you cheat on me I'll cut your balls off, only slightly sarcastically) and I made it clear that any further issues would end it. 

We managed to move on with lots of open discussion, then I discovered she was doing drugs when going out with her friends on weekends (I wasn't going as my symptoms flared up with alcohol), which I said I wasn't comfortable with as I didn't know how they would affect her personality and boundaries.

**Current situation**: Since then she has been testing my patience more, doing weed etc (I avoid all drugs due to my health issues) and on Saturday I went to her house for the weekend to be greeted by her crying saying she had been unhappy for a few months and had done ecstasy and got with another guy (friend of a friend) in a bar. I said that was inexcusable, if she had told me of her worries as she had previously we could have worked through it, but that boat had sailed and we agreed to move on separately. I stayed the night so we could discuss further in the morning with clearer heads then left.

As with many posts like this in r/relationships, I am still in love with her and she is my best friend and core source of emotional support. Her family were very encouraging of our relationship, her mum calling me her son-in-law for the last year or so, and our friendship groups are now almost completely identical. She appears to severely regret her actions and wants to stay in touch in case situations change and we may become more compatible in the future.

 My questions are:

- Have I made the right choice sticking with my morals or am I cutting off my nose to spite my face by risking my friendship group and support structure?

- I want to remain friends with her so that if we cross paths again in the future through mutual friends we can get along without it being awkward; is this sensible or will risk emotional instability?

- We are currently having a week long period to wind down, talking to each other to tie up loose ends etc. Would it be sensible to cut off communication completely, which I am concerned may make things difficult next time we talk/ see each other, or just try to wind down to friendship level?

- How explicit should I be with how badly she has betrayed my trust and crushed my self belief? I am being very cautious not to be rash as this is a very fine line we are walking from serious relationship to positive friendship.

- Is offering the option to potentially try again in the future a mistake? I am aware cheaters never change, but I have never been this close to anyone and the thought of losing all the effort we have both put in over the last 3 years is really depressing.

- As I've said, this is my first breakup and my already fragile mental health is taking a beating. Any advice on coping/ moving on would be much appreciated 😅

**TL;DR** my girlfriend cheated on me and did things I had explicitly said I was uncomfortable with, so despite wanting to be with her I have ended our relationship. Looking for advice on how to remain amicable to avoid losing our mutual friends.

99non2,171,2018-08-23,An Unofficial Timeline: Update 1.3,chaotickairos,BokuNoHeroAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/99non2/an_unofficial_timeline_update_13/,"**Introduction and Methodology**


Hello everybody! It’s been a while. The sub has grown massively since I first posted my timeline, so it seems like there will be a lot of people who are unfamiliar with it. I’ll briefly introduce how this works, and those who are familiar can skip to the patch notes!


Generally speaking, Japanese high schools follow a trimester system. It is possible that UA might be using a semester system, but so far the dates have aligned with the trimester systems, so we will assume as such. We will adjust accordingly if it proves to be a different case.


Term 1 starts in April, usually the second week, and runs to mid-late July. Students usually have August and sometimes parts of surrounding months off.


Term 2 starts in September and runs to late December. Winter break is usually the last week or December and first week of January.


Term 3 runs from January to late March, when we have a break before the school year starts. There are a few ways we can tell where events in the story take place. First, in relation to each other. Horikoshi will usually tell us how far apart events in the story happen to each other. The second is through known events in the Japanese school schedules. For example, the dates when students change uniforms is a set time. While we can’t pinpoint the exact dates of the story events, we can still narrow down events to the week or so.


**How accurate is this timeline?**


Shortly after I posted this, I was linked to a timeline from the official guidebook, [here](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/250678661064294411/362031037745856513/image.jpg?width=1552&amp;height=1164). The guidebook timeline is very vague, and only goes up to the beginning of summer break, but it does confirm that everything I had written up to that point was completely accurate. The only difference is where it places the training camp during summer break. I’m not sure if they’re suggesting it takes place in July (which is mathematically impossible due to the information Horikoshi gives us in the manga) or by putting it in the arrow as opposed to the actual main part of the month where all other events are placed that they’re trying to say that it takes place during summer break but not necessarily in July. (I’m still going with my timeline because the math fits. YMMV)


**Why does this matter?**


Using a timeline, we have a way of figuring out how much time had passed, and how much time could pass in the rest of the series. We also can use it to guess events that might happen using our knowledge of the school system, or how long the series might be. Also, it's just fun! It's good for speculating, and fic writers. 


**Patch Notes:**


•	Timeline is now accurate to chapter 194. It might not be 100% accurate as I’ve had to do some more guesswork than usual. However, I’ve decided for now to firmly place the Pro Hero arc in November. I’ll talk a little more about my reasoning later. 


•	I’ve placed extra material, such as the movie (tentatively) and light novel chapters into the timeline. Since the canonicity of these supplemental material is debated, I’ve placed them in italics. I’ll add more as they get translated. So far, only light novel 3 is fully translated. I also haven’t touched vigilantes yet. I’m not sure if I ever will. 


•	To do: My goal was to add in flashbacks into the timeline, but unfortunately I was unable to get to it due to some extenuating family issues. I’m going to have to reread the entire series to make sure I’ve got it right, and I just haven’t had the time. It should be there in the next version update!

* 	Day after encounter: Chapter 70. Class occurs.


**END OF TERM 1: Early to Mid July.**


Notes:


Term 1 takes up about 65 chapters. At some point between this point (chap 70) and chap 80, Horikoshi proclaimed that the series was around 20% done. We are unsure of the exact date the interview took place, but I’d guess in between chapter 70 and chapter 80 as a rather loose estimate. Season 2 ends here.


**SUMMER BREAK BEGINS**

Chapter 4 covers the 1-A and 1-B girls having a get together that night. Chapter 3 is, as far as I know, untranslated but presumably takes place this day as well.*

* 	School Trip, Day 2: Early-Mid August: Chapter 71-72. Students work on upgrading their quirks. Villains begin to gather. *Light Novel Chapter 5 covers a arm wrestling match/pillow fight between the 1-A and 1-B boys. Chapter 6 occurs later that night.* 


* 	School Trip, Day 3: Chapter 73- 83. Training continues. Villain attack occurs during the test of courage. Bakugou is kidnapped.

* 	I day later, 2 days since kidnapping: Chapter 83- 94. Izuku is released from the hospital. Kamino Arc occurs.


* 	1 day after Kamino, Mid August: Chapter 95. All for One is incarcerated, Izuku and All Might meet on the beach. The end of the age of All Might.


* 	In the week after Kamino, Mid August: 96-97. Home visits occur. Students enter the dorms. *Light Novel 3 Chapter 1 occurs. The teachers go out for drinks.* 


* 	11 days before Term 2: 98-99. Students move into the dorms. Dorm room contest occurs. *Light Novel 3 Chapter 2 details the move in process.*

* 	*Light novel 3 chapters 3 &amp; 4 occur at some point between now and the Provisional Exam. 1-B visits 1-A’s dorm. 1-A tells ghost stories and get into trouble.*

**CURRENT ANIME STOPPING POINT. MANGA SPOILERS ARE UNMARKED PAST THIS POINT.**


* 	1 Day before Term 2, Early September: Chapters 102-121. License Exam occurs. Twice’s backstory is revealed, Overhaul is introduced. All Might meets with All for One. At night, Bakugou vs Izuku occurs. (Note: This occurs roughly 2 weeks after Kamino, placing AFO vs All Might in Mid-August. Generally, Term 2 starts the first week of September.)


**END OF SUMMER BREAK- First week of September.**


Notes: Summer break runs for 50 chapters. Calculating when the arcs take place is difficult, and I was forced to count backwards from the end of break in order to measure things. I’ve already brought up the issue of the accuracy of the School Trip Arc’s placement, but license exam and all the arcs relative to each other should be accurate.

Ending Notes:
	

I decided to place the Pro Hero arc in November due to the fact that the season seems to have officially changed in 194. With the introduction of winter costumes, and because Japan considers December to be the beginning of winter, I think that it’s safe to place the joint lessons in December. The season could have easily changed earlier, but with the info we’re given, I’m not really able to pin down the exact day. 



Other points of interest: So by this point, we’ve reached enough chapters to surpass 20 volumes, which was Horikoshi’s original plan for the series. I like to place these sorts of numbers in notes so people can have it for speculation, but I also feel like this is the perfect example to show that original plans and numbers never quite line up with reality. From various interviews, we know that the most recent arc was some kind of turning point for the series, so take that as you will! 

All in all, this was a rather short update, sorry about that. Hopefully next update I'll finish up all the flashbacks and then it will be complete, except for new content. Have fun, and happy speculating!

Edit: The formatting was atrocious so I fixed it. Sorry!"
99nvja,14,2018-08-23,Toxic Environment - My Opinion as a Product Manager,tayloed,ProductManagement,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/99nvja/toxic_environment_my_opinion_as_a_product_manager/,"A lunch topic came up recently with a former intern about toxic environments and how to deal with them. She is dealing with this at her company. She was surprised to hear that her ""wonderful internship experience"" at our former employer was in my view a toxic environment.  She had no clue that I was experiencing toxicity because I refused to let it filter down to the team.

Everyone has an opinion on what makes a toxic environment but here are some indicators:

* Poor leadership
* Death march projects
* Politics &amp; Cliques
* harsh belittling or inappropriate speech patterns
* Long work days without consideration of the staff personal life
* no opportunity for job growth, promotion, new opportunities
* You don't feel fulfilled

The operational question is what should you do as a product manager?

My general and strictly personal opinion: Any adult can deal with hell for at least one year.  So if you are thinking of leaving a job before a year has completed there had better be a very good reason that you can document and show in your future job interviews. I regularly form a hypothesis that any resume that has less than 1 year in any job is lacking something and then try to prove or disprove this in the interview process. This assumes that they even get a chance to interview.

How then do you deal with the toxicity? Here are some of my tips that I have used.

1) As long as it depends on you, do your best.

    Do your job to the best of your ability in the time allotted. Use one of my favorite sayings ""Illegitimi non carborundum.""

2) Change things you can.

    You can always find something to brighten the environment. Sometimes it could be something simple like bring in flowers or cupcakes (donuts are so cliche). Hand-write a thank you note. Call out something that someone did as positive in a meeting.

3) The barbs are symptoms, not the issue

    When someone throws out a barb in a meeting, email, or slack don't respond in kind. Recognize that it is likely an expression of frustration. And if it isn't, see ""Illegitimi non carborundum.""

4) Find something to learn.

    We don't know it all, or possibly don't know anything. I'm told that often by teens. There is always something to learn.

5) Never Quit

    What? Yes I mean never quit. But always have a plan to take your positive attitude and your career to the next level that is right for you. It is OK to move to something better, but don't just outright quit.

6) Quit quickly if legal, ethical, or safety issues are involved

   Yes, I just contradicted myself. Oh well. Don't care. Deal with it. Ethics is more about your personal life but it has broad-reaching benefits to our society too. Safety (physical and emotional) should never be compromised. Make sure that you keep documentation on the reasons for your resignation. As for legal - know what is legal and illegal in your projects. You don't want to have the cops showing up at your door.

\----------

**Lastly:** ""I don't feel fulfilled"" .... ""I'm not living up to my potential"" ... ""They don't recognize my contribution"" ....

Sorry to say this - the problem is likely you. As Captain Jack Sparrow said  “T*he problem is not the problem. The problem is your attitude about the problem. Do you understand?*”  Change your attitude and go back to tips 1-6."

99nx7j,53,2018-08-23,(Long) Backyard June Wedding Recap + Budget + Details,mastercraftspanda,weddingplanning,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/99nx7j/long_backyard_june_wedding_recap_budget_details/,"It's been two months since our wedding and I am finally getting around to this here recap. Recaps are always my favorite posts on weddit and I always found them so helpful (and joyful!). So, hopefully there's some useful information here. Or whatever, just some [pretty pictures](https://imgur.com/a/oA6dOL7) :)

**Background:** Engaged Halloween 2017, married June 16, 2018. Together almost three years now!

We were discussing our wedding from the beginning and ended up picking my hometown pretty naturally after some talk of other spots. It just made sense as it's super gorgeous, combines ocean and forest (our fav environments) and my family has connections there so we were able to get some deals along the way. I also have worked in the wedding industry there so I knew all the vendors and basically how it would work.

After two anxiety attacks post engagement, I realized I had no interest or mental bandwidth to full-on plan a wedding while also going to grad school full time, trying to get an internship, and plan out my career future. Neither did my partner (he was the one who wanted a wedding) who worked full-time. However, my mom DID very much want to plan our wedding. I know this could be a recipe for disaster, but it was totally wonderful. She fully took over our planning. We made a budget spreadsheet and did have several regular phone meetings \~1 hour but she did all the logistic calling and organizing. She would send me a message like ""I need two rolls of white paper, 20in or wider"" and I would order and ship to her. As she lives in the town of the wedding and we are 4+ hours away it was very helpful to have her do all this for us and she did an amazing job. She is magic.

&amp;#x200B;

Invited: 98

Declined:22

Attended: 76

I did an rsvp breakdown post earlier; you can check it out in my history if you want more details on this. We tried to keep things somewhat small, but to me small would be 12 people, not one hundred; our final number still felt big. Also being in my home town was a challenge as pretty much everyone there would have loved to come, but a 500 person wedding was not in the budget nor was it what we wanted. So we mostly stuck to people that both of us had met. There were a few exceptions but this gave us some good parameters for invites. We also were able to invite a few more people closer to the date when we knew there were a fair number of declines and that was lovely.

&amp;#x200B;

**Original Budget: $20,000**

**Final Budget: $18,300**

This was surprising to me. I thought we'd be way over. However, this doesn't include honeymoon or rings - only one each, exchanged at engagement. With those it would be over the original budget.

*A note: we paid for the wedding and rings ourselves. I saved up haaaard at the beginning of our relationship since I was going to start grad school and make zero money and I wanted to be able to contribute to our wedding. $20k was a number we felt comfortable (sort of- I still balked at the idea of dropping it all on the day) spending, and felt like we could manage. We split it approximately evenly, since our finances weren't combined at the time, but it was sort of a whoever was available to send the check/venmo/get cash would do so, but it all felt like it was from us. My parents were unable to give us financial assistance but obviously did a lot of physical and mental help, and allowed us to use their home which was huge. His parents bought and bring a bunch of wine that we didn't expect which was very welcome but other than that it was on us. This may have made things much easier politically, as we had final say on almost everything.*

**Paper goods**\- $190

As an artist and graphic designer, there was no way I was going to skip on doing this, but I wanted to try to stay relatively budget. Partner wanted them to be fun and colorful. I wanted them to be different from all the ones I've done for friends and clients. Turns out that meant leaning hard on our spirit animals (Panda and Dolphin) which became a motif that was used through the wedding and actually throughout our relationship. We used CatPrint and I was able to use leftover envelopes and grabbed up a big stash of stamps whenever I saw good ones. This also included custom return address stamp and decorative logo stamp.

**Ceremony** \-$700

We booked Cypress Grove, a circle of trees on the headlands with a natural arch made of branches, and the ocean behind it. We had a neighbor offer their property for free but we walked into Cypress Grove and my partners jaw dropped. He wanted ocean. I wanted forest. It is spectacular and felt very special,  especially because I later found a polaroid I took a decade earlier of this very circle of trees with the note ""I want to get married here"" on the back. Also my parents were married about 100ft away on the same headlands so it felt right.

It was a pricy fee for essentially 30 min but you get the location for the whole weekend (Friday-Sunday) and it's a State Park so I felt ok about the $$ fee for this. Not included is the chairs and benches which are lumped into rentals in the reception category but they were about $150

**Reception**\- $6,595

* Venue- free (parents backyard)
* Rentals- $3,915
* Charcuterie, Dessert table- $525
* Bathroom caravan- free
* Catering- $1,600 (local taqueria, this covered three kinds of tacos, chips, salsa and salad and it was SO YUMMY and made excellent leftovers we had for dinner on Sunday too)
* Drinks- $555

Notes: We paid for rentals in full on signing contract so we got a discount for that along with a friends and family discount of 10%. I've known the owner of the local rental company forever. His daughter and I are childhood friends and it was also very helpful (for them and us) that they could set up on the Wednesday and Thursday before and didn't have to take down until the following Tuesday.

The bathrooms were a gift. My father did some work as a gift for the owner and so they didn't let us pay for the bathrooms. They were so cute (looked like a little house! and had lights and art and running water etc.). It really helped to have bathrooms in the yard and not worry about strain on the house bathrooms.

**Bride &amp; Groom attire**\- $2,632

* Groom- $588 (asos 3 piece suit, reception blazer, shirts, DIY tie from brides dress fabric)
* Groom Tailoring- $440 (custom vest back and tailoring of pants and both blazers)
* Bride- $940 (custom green velvet dress, and mother’s wedding dress remade as rehearsal dress)
* HMU- $664 (Bride, BFF/MoH/Officiant, makeup for MoB and hair for MoG)
* Bride’s Wreath- $0 (made by mom, mom's bff and my bff morning of the wedding from plants picked in the garden and forest. They checked the meaning of each item to make sure it was positive.)

**Decorations**\- $1,135

* Yard- $370 (my parents spent every weekend of our engagement working in the garden to make sure everything was blooming and perfect. This amount covered paying someone to come in and weed the yard and a load of manure for all the flower beds in March. I loved writing a check with 'wedding poop' in the memo line cause I act like I’m 5!)
* Flowers- $0 (ferns and greenery picked from forest day of by groom)
* Paper Plates/Napkins- $45 (for cocktail hour and desserts)
* Wedding Flag- $100 (getting custom flag made from our StD was the BEST CHOICE!)
* Additional Decor and Signs- $620 (not good at keeping this itemized but it includes 7 felt letter boards, fringe and tassel garlands, piñata supplies for DIY piñata, balloons, two large signs for ceremony and reception venues, photo guest book and other misc items.)

**Vendors**\- $6,069

* Photography- $4,464 (engagement shoot, 8 hours at wedding and hotel room for photographer. *We LOVED our photographer and both had her as first choice from my spreadsheet of 50 possible photographers. She was at the top end of our budget and we sort of picked our date around her availability but she was 1000% worth it. So wonderful to work with and her photos are spectacular so this very much felt like the category that we splurged in.)*
* DJ-$100 (local DJ for 2 hours, he kinda didn't do much and it was a mess, more on that later, but we'd also asked my cousin who is a pretty big deal EDM DJ to do an hour set at the end as a gift.)
* Day of Coordinator- gift/$450 (a family friend who is a wedding planner offered to Day Of for us for free but we gave her $450 cash with her thank you card and a really nice bottle of wine)
* Transportation- $180 (last min choice to book a shuttle van for 3 hours. Very good for piece of mind as there are no uber/lyft/cabs in the area. A few people used it, including us to reach the after-party bar.)
* Servers x3-$375 (one local caterer and 2 high school girls)
* Dance Lessons -$100 first lesson, we did not end up going for more after and just winged it
* Ceremony Musicians- gift/$200 (flute and cello, another last min choice after panicked question posted here. My mom sorted this out in 20 min; thank goodness for a tight local community and everyone there knowing me since birth)

**Additional**\- $1,278

* Gifts -$680 (necklaces for our Wedding Fairy and Officiant/MoH/Bff and my parents)
* Wine- $163 (Thank you wine for friends who gifted us their cottage in town for our whole stay)
* Insurance- $100
* Rental Car + Gas- $230
* Certificates/license- $105

**Things that were amazing!**

*Ditching all the traditions we didn't resonate with us* \- No wedding party, no bouquet or garter toss, no cake, no flowers, minimal gender references other than attire, green dress, among many others

*My dress*\- Can't say enough good about both non traditional (green) wedding dresses and going custom. I lucked into finding the most amazing person to bring my vision to life (if you are in the Bay Area and looking for a custom gown let me know, she's spectacular). I doubted my choice a lot and worried I was missing out on some classic wedding experiences by not shopping but in the end my dress was amazing, felt like me, and also special; it was totally affordable and one of a kind. Best part: it's currently getting hemmed to knee length and I will wear it for birthdays, holidays, anniversary and pretty much every occasion I can think of in the future.

*Ceremony*\- Writing our own ceremony was so meaningful. Everyone told us afterwards it was the most special and personal wedding they had been to. We had multiple requests to get a copy to read. It was very tailored to us and our love story and also our long discussions on what we intended marriage to be and what kind of partnership we were building. The declarations of love and vows were very personal, ranging from serious to funny to heartfelt, with a dramatic flair. We were able to include a vow for all of our guests which was particularly special.

*Mom as wedding planner*\- can't rave about this enough, although I recognize that doing this is VERY dependent on the mom in question. She really made the wedding happen and made it as lovely as it was. She listened to what we wanted but was also totally able to take the lead when it wasn't something we felt strongly about.

*Having my partner help plan* \- While he was not interested in every aspect, he was involved in many aspects of planning, ranging from decision-making to logistical tasks to creating and curating spreadsheets. He set up and wrote most of the wedding website. We set up a joint email account so that either of us could respond and both of us were in the loop. He wrote his declarations of love and vows, first. He told my planner mom to include him in comms. He approved most major decisions. It felt reasonably fair and equitable and helped calm my anxiety that all the pressure was on me.

*The Cottage*\- Having a house of our own for the week of the wedding was a huge boon. We had planned on getting a hotel room at the hotel with everyone else but someone offered us their vacation home/cottage and it was the most wonderful thing. This was such a special gift.

*Local Flavor and Favors*\- My hometown really made this magical. It's a very tight community (my high school class was 18 just for size context) and everywhere we went someone knew it was our wedding. The whole town did everything they could to make my partner feel welcomed and it was truly a community wide effort which made the week leading up to it as we were getting everything read so incredibly positive and love filled.

*Getting ready together*\- My partner and I never felt the need for distance pre-ceremony and I in-fact felt much more secure knowing I would be with him before. I am a worrier and suffer from extreme social anxiety and he is so good at calming me and making me feel comfortable. We got ready together at our cottage with just the photographer; she took detail photos and chatted with us while we got dressed. We then took off for photos in the woods and on the headlands before meeting up with our family. After family photos we went back to our cottage for a bit to wait for all the guests to arrive at the ceremony location. We meditated, shared a bowl of cereal (Peanut Butter Panda Puffs cause they are the best) and just sat together grinning. When we got the go signal from our coordinator, we walked to the ceremony location together, just the two of us. It was less than 10 minutes and we walked past so many places from my childhood and memories. Arriving to our wedding ceremony together felt really good. It felt like how we wanted to begin our marriage.

*Ceremony Music*\- A week out from the wedding we realized we had no music at the ceremony and panicked. Called planner mom and she got back to me within a half hour with four options. We picked the flute/cello duo and they let us pick from a long list of songs for our processional/recessional (I Can't Help Falling in Love and Happy Together, for reference; can't listen to either without weeping) and played pretty celtic/elvish/fantasy feeling music before the ceremony while guests arrived. I am so glad we decided to add this at the last minute.

*Wedding Piñata*\- 10/10 would do again. It was my one ask and I'm so glad my partner was on board.

**Things that didn't go very well**

*HMU*\- There weren't a lot of options in town for this and it's so far away from anywhere that bringing in an artist for this would have been $$$$ in travel fees. The only other option I could find was $1000 MINIMUM just for the brides makeup and that felt crazy to me as someone who wears nothing but mascara usually. The vendor we ended up going with was fine, she did a good job at the minimal, looks-nice-but-not-all-makeup-y look that I asked for, and she did lovely makeup for my mom and bff as well. However, communication with her was awful. She took weeks to get back to us and was very reticent to do a contract with us. My mom had to go in in person to get it because she didn't get around to emailing.

Then, on the day of, I was done a bit late after I had been bullied into getting my hair done too. I was just gonna brush it and plop the flower crown on because my hair does what it wants + wind meant nothing would stay long anyway. We had to be really insistent to pay and get to leave. BFF and mom were still there getting their stuff done but my partner and I had to go get dressed for photos. They told us that we had to pay the makeup artist and her friend who came in to help with hair separately. This WAS NOT part of the contract and it was very stressful and confusing, especially because they couldn’t give updated totals quickly. They were super lax and casual about slowly meandering over to do the math on this and we were frazzled and getting texts from photog and day of asking where we were.

I wish we had just handed the envelope with the check+cash tip to my mom and said ""gotta go, sort this out for us."" Instead, we stayed for THIRTY MINUTES sorting this out. It put us way behind on photos and made me really frustrated. We also paid for MoG hair as she had said she would come but then she never showed. I checked with her month and week before and the day before at the rehearsal. Also texted to remind her (no cell reception didn’t help) but it's a small thing and not the end of the world. In hindsight I should have gone with my friend who does makeup very well just me at our cottage and plopped the wreath on my head and got going.

*Ceremony*\- While I ended up loving our ceremony, I did not enjoy the process of writing it and getting it together. We asked my best friend, who also introduced us, to officiate for us. She said yes, but then due to miscommunication or something she ended up being pretty absent from the planning. My partner and I spoke at length about what we wanted to include in the ceremony. He drafted his vows and declarations of love first, which helped set the tone and I followed . But none of had the initiative to write the main script.

I ended up sitting down six weeks out, binging real ceremony videos and transcripts, and then writing out the first draft of ours one very tear filled afternoon at the coffee shop across the street from our house. I wish there had been clearer communication about who would write the ceremony and perhaps a timeline with deadlines as leaving it until the end was no fun. Still we got an amazing ceremony in the end and I was rather proud to have written it myself.

*Photo List*\- Our photographer was amazing and the photos are so completely beautiful. However, I do wish that I had thought more about who I wanted to get photos of and with during the wedding. I was sort of lax about it but there were people I rarely get to see who are incredibly important to me and I should have made a more detailed list of shots so that I would have made sure to get photos with them. Sadly, there are some people that I have ZERO photos of. This is on me but still makes me pretty sad.

*Music/DJ*\- My mom got a local kid (not a kid anymore I guess but I used to babysit him so he feels like a kid) to DJ the dinner and dancing up until my cousin took over. However, neither my mom nor my cousin communicated with him well, so he didn't have our list of songs for dances, and didn't know names of people. He didn’t even show up when we expected. He didn't play much of anything from our meticulously gathered playlist (which I still listen to today-it's good) from guests’ and our favorites. He played the full song for our first dance instead of just through the first verse, so we were stuck dancing through the whole thing. Luckily we are super good at winging it and just dancing and having fun but it felt awkward. Then it turned out he only intended to stay until 7:30 and the reception went until 10pm! Again, so so lucky that my cousin is so awesome and stepped in to DJ our whole dance party. She had prepared an amazing electronic set of her own stuff which really got the dance floor going and then played a great mix of other music after to close out the night.

**In closing!**

Whew this is so long. Congratulations if you have actually read all the way to the end; I am impressed.

I was someone who didn't want a wedding but engaged to someone who did, which seems to be a common situation around these parts. I really really really wanted to just elope in the woods with our immediate family and be done with it. I love weddings as a guest but hate being the center of attention and I have social anxiety. As a designer, I felt there was an unachievable expectation on me for the beauty and perfection of what my wedding would look like.

But, consider me a convert. We were sitting at our sweetheart table during dinner just looking out over everyone eating their tacos and drinking wine and laughing and talking and realized that there were all these amazing connections happening between parts of our lives that had never intersected. Friends of mine who live far away meeting his cousins, or my childhood neighbor and pen pal chatting with my grad school studio mate. It was so special to start our marriage surrounded by people we love.

I wish I hadn't stressed about everything being perfect. I wish I hadn't worried about what a wedding 'should be' and 'should look like' because you know what: it was ok that there was not a single flower on the tables, or that my dress was green, or a hundred other things I worried about leading up to it. I am so grateful for all the helping hands which brought together all the bits and pieces to make the perfect wedding for my husband and I. I am honored to have so many special people who came so far to celebrate and share in our love.

Also this community here was a total lifesaver. It was my happy place when I got stressed or worried and I always felt so welcome and supported. Thank you all for all of the help, positivity and good wishes! I'm kind of sad it's over cause it seems like I have no reason to be on weddit anymore, though I'll probably linger around for a while. But if anyone is in the Bay Area and wants to chat weddings, let me know!

99o093,12,2018-08-23,Dear r/parrots. Can I please ask for some help?,KittFurlong,parrots,https://www.reddit.com/r/parrots/comments/99o093/dear_rparrots_can_i_please_ask_for_some_help/,"Hello every one!

Tuesday I just full filled another special dream of mine when it comes to birds. I bought a sun conure girl (only couple of months old). The seller took me for a tour at his place, showed me the parents and all his other beautiful birds. The tour included a Golden Parakeet flock, Scarlet Red and Pink macaws. A pair of cockatoo's (not sure what specie they were, but their crest was not yellow, just white). And a flock of pigeons. It was really an awesome experience and we had such a great talk together. I got documents that includes the DNA test confirming she is female from the seller.

I named my sun conure girl Herbie. Some of you might recognize the name as it is inspired by the Disney film Herbie from 1968. Owning and handling birds isn't totally out of experience. I studied zoo keeping with great interest in avians. I had the pleasure of having an internship in a bird park where I handled different macaw, cockatoo's, tucans, conures and eclectus species. I've had budgies for about twenty years in my childhood and youth and four years ago I got my first cockatiel, which I currently have three of.

I've made sure to brush up and read about the sun conures, but it's still worlds apart from dealing with them wild to having one as a pet. Right?

So I could us my help with some advice. So here is a list of questions that I have.

1. Herbie doesn't like when I have to leave the apartment and put her in the cage. It doesn't happen every day and when I do I have made it limited since she's still settling down in her new home. Unfortunately she screams out for me and she does that too when I go to bed. I always talk with my birds and let them know I'll be back home soon again. I've tried to play some calm jazz music today when I went out (was only gone for an hour). But that did not work. I know all of this as my brother informed me (he lives here too). So what can I do to help make Herbie feel safe and teach her that the cage is not bad or that I don't care for her. My birds cages are in the same room as I sleep in. Unfortunately there is no where else I can put the cage.
2. What way should I do the training? I've seen people using clickers for their birds. What is a good reward to give them to give positive reinforcement (avoiding feeding them unhealthy treats as reward). And what do I do if she does something she should not do? For instance, she likes to bite on my glasses, but I really don't want them to break.
3. What is ideal toys to keep her active and entertained? At the moment she only have these rattle balls that contains bells inside. My cockatiels loves playing with wooden chop sticks and Herbie has enjoyed these as well. I want to make sure I offer her something safe and something that keeps her from becoming too bored.

If you have read this far, I just want to thank you for taking the time to do so. I look forward to hear what you guys have to say."
99o40m,56,2018-08-23,Completed both my summer fitness goals today!,korra767,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/99o40m/completed_both_my_summer_fitness_goals_today/,"I started this round of weight loss right after my Spring semester ended. I had just gotten out of a bad relationship and was heartbroken. I looked in the mirror and felt terrible. I avoided weighing myself during the semester because I knew it would be bad. I ate fast food at least once a day, drank soda almost every day, and just generally found comfort in food. Finally I weighed myself at the beginning of the summer. I was the heaviest I've ever been - 180 lbs. 

I was in a new state for an internship, so I was ready to make some changes. I set two goals:

1. Go from hating running with every fiber of my being to running a 5K in under 35 minutes.

2. Reach 160 lbs.

I knew my eating habits had to change, so when I started my summer internship I focused on rarely eating out and never drinking soda. I started dropping some pounds but hit a plateau around 172. After a frustrating couple of weeks, I decided to start CICO. Myfitnesspal told me 1500 calories. I thought I was going to die the first couple of days but got used to it surprisingly quick!

Meanwhile I ran about 3 times a week following C25K. I had to repeat a couple of days but before I knew it I had run for 30 minutes straight! 

That's really all I did to change my lifestyle. I still eat pizza, mcdonalds, and icecream, but I eat a LOT less! It honestly makes the food taste so much better because I earned it. I saved my calories all day for this bowl of icecream, so I'm gonna freaking enjoy it!!! I still hate running, but my stamina is a lot better and I'm looking forward to being able to play intramural soccer in the spring! 

Anyway, so today I got up early before class for a run. I was excited for my weekly weigh in this morning because I had been particularly good this week with calories. The scale surprised me by reading 156 lbs! Last weeks weigh-in was 160.8! I know it's probably just a fluctuation but at the very least this means I am officially under 160!!!!

Riding this high, I jumped on the treadmill and punched in to run a 5K. I haven't officially tried to run a 5K all summer because my pace has been pretty slow and I'd all but given up on goal #2. As per usual, about 2 miles in I wanted to give up real bad. ""But how good would it feel to run a 5K before class this morning?"" I asked myself. I kept running. ""Just run 0.25 more miles. Now 0.25 more."" Before I knew it the treadmill stopped and the time read... 34:04. HOLY SHIT. Goal #2 completed!!! On the same day!! 

So I've completed both summer goals! Technically school started on Monday, but I'm so happy. It's been a rough week so far, and I really needed this win. I'm only down 20 lbs so there isn't much transformation, but I'll post progress pics if anyone asks (and if I can figure out how imgur works haha). 

Keep pushing everyone!! We can do this!!"
99o7x9,7,2018-08-23,Bad internship experience and negative performance review. I need to rant.,themainevent505,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/99o7x9/bad_internship_experience_and_negative/,"Hi everyone,

My internship ended about 2 weeks ago but I can’t shake the negative feelings that I walked away with, and I need to rant. I also have some concerns about using references from this internship and would love some advice.

Some background - I just completed a business internship with a Fortune 50 company that is known for providing one of the “best” internship experiences. In my area, interns were given their own projects and were assigned an individual manager and director to oversee their work. This post is pertaining to the performance review I received on my last day where I was completely blindsided by the highly negative feedback given to me.

About 3 weeks into the internship, I began realizing that my intern experience was vastly different from the experiences of my peers. I made friends with other interns, and their managers were setting up multiple one-on-ones per week with them and including them in frequent meetings pertaining to their projects. I met with my manager only 7 times throughout the summer, and I had to initiate a couple of those. At times, an HR representative would check in with us to see if we were having regular one-on-ones with our managers. I never spoke up, which I regret, because I didn’t want to cause trouble for my manager. Now I realize that I was overprotective of a manager that wasn’t invested in my success.

I had a huge lack of guidance for my project compared to other interns, and I was often flying by the seat of my pants to determine when/how my work would get done. In addition, 3-4 weeks into the internship, my manager decided to change my project topic (this topic had been set since January). I went along with this despite being anxious about losing several weeks of work. Well it turns out that the new topic didn’t go the way my manager planned, so she changed things back again about 2 and 1/2 weeks later. I lost about 3 weeks worth of work due to this, and I believe it was apparent in our final presentations when mine seemed less developed than the other intern projects.

Now regarding the performance review. Some things said to me included:

1. My manager said a weakness was my Excel skills. I was a bit shocked when I heard this, as I have taken an entire course on Excel and used it throughout the summer without issues. I asked if she could clarify an instance where she saw this weakness. Her response was that she once saw me point to cells while working on a spreadsheet with my finger which “showed her that I didn’t know how to sort data.” Um, what? I know I should have defended myself here, as this feedback was utterly inaccurate and speculative.
2. My manager said a weakness was that I had issues with time zones when scheduling 2 phone meetings throughout the summer. Again, I was shocked when she brought this up, because she was aware that one of the errors was due to the person on the other end (they thought we were in the same state even though we weren’t, and they scheduled the meeting accordingly). The second error was indeed my fault - I called in an hour early, realized my mistake, and simply called them back an hour later at the correct time. At the time this occurred, I apologized to my manager and director and they said “it’s ok” and “time zones can be confusing.” Apparently it wasn’t ok.
3. My manager said I lacked in entrepreneurial attitude and lacked in creating value. She said this was due to me showing lack of initiative in escalating situations that involved resources from outside parties. However, I DID escalate the situations as much as I could, which often involved 5+ emails to the same person before they would respond. From the beginning, my manager made it blatantly clear to me that she was busy and overworked, so I thought I was doing her a favor by not updating her on every single correspondence and detail of my day and instead carrying out my work on my own. 
4. My manager said I wasn’t engaged with the team. I am an introvert by nature and I like observing more than participating in endless small-talk conversations. In addition, my desk was very separated from my team’s cubicles, so I couldn’t jump over and chip in every time I heard someone talking. I will admit that I had a hard time being engaged with my manager, but she also seemed entirely disinterested in me. However, I felt that I actually did form relationships with about 5/11 of my team members, and I genuinely enjoyed my time with them. Hearing my manager say that I wasn’t engaged made me devalue and doubt the friendships I believed I had made. My manager even directly said “There were probably times during the summer where you had questions but I was busy. Maybe if you had formed relationships with other people on the team, then they could have helped you instead.” Not only was this a shady remark, but it was not the responsibility of other associates to guide my project, nor did they know what my project was about beyond the surface level.

The only positives my manager mentioned were that I had good penmanship (really? this was laughable in my opinion…), I was thorough, and that I had a good moral compass.  

A couple of things really bother me about this whole situation. First is that NONE of these concerns were brought up to me over the course of the summer; based on the times I actually got to meet with my manager and director about my project, they seemed pleased at the time. If my manager and director had perceived issues with my performance, I would’ve loved to have received feedback along the way as opposed to being told every complaint on my last day. Second, I hate that I didn’t defend myself against some of this feedback that was blatantly inaccurate. Performance reviews are so tricky because the higher-ups come in prepared with what they’re going to say, but you have to just roll with the punches. I was so flabbergasted by the end of the review that when my manager asked if I had any feedback for them, all I could say was that I enjoyed my experience and learned a lot (which wasn’t entirely true, and I should’ve instead used this opportunity to address the poor management that I experienced).

I am beginning to apply for full-time positions now, and I am weary of putting down my manager or director as references for this position because I don’t want these pieces of feedback (which I feel do not represent me or my work AT ALL) to come back to haunt me. Sorry if I sound whiny, but I have many regrets about taking this internship, and I wish I had worked for a different company "

In the past things had been good. One of the biggest regional manufacturers, you'd produced clothing that had ended up on catwalks and had been spotted on celebrities. 

But in recent years, things have taken a turn for the worst. With growing competition from multinational companies, people aren't buying local. Why spend $100 on a pair of handcrafted jeans when you can get a pair made in a sweatshop for less than half the price? Although your factory used to have hundreds of people working there, now there's less than a dozen, and even they're struggles to justify staying here when their pay-cheques are so inconsistent. 

One night, another sleepless night going over the paperwork trying to make these impossible sums turn a profit, I knock on your door. I'm a young man fresh out of a degree in business management. Fresh out being the operative word, seeing that I ended up dropping out of my course. With no real qualifications, no real family or friends in the local area, and a desire to make *something* out of my life, I've been knocking around every business in the area trying to get *some* sort of opportunity. I don't even want to be paid, I just want an internship, a chance to prove myself and get some experience. 

However, neither of us could predict how our business relationship was going to pan out. We don't know that we'll find a gap in the market, a gap for luxury lingerie and naughty outfits. We don't know that, having no money to hire models, *I'll* be the one trying them on for the photo shoots. And we don't know that, growing ever close and closer, our relationship will go from strictly business to one of pleasure...

Hi there! As the prompt suggests, I'm looking for a long-term feminisation prompt between a failing business owner and a desperate intern. 

I always think these prompts work best when we both have some sort of vulnerabilities. Your character will be a failing business owner (male or female, although the former is preferred) who is stressed out from having to deal with these pressures. Perhaps you've got divorced because of the stresses of the job, or your relationship is on the rocks. My character will be a young man (18+) who is effectively homeless and penniless, looking for any opportunity to get my life started. I like the idea of my character viewing yours as a father figure, with the more sexual implications that brings, but if you're not open to that I understand. 

I would like this feminisation and character development to be long-term and gradual, with our characters naturally changing. I envision a couple of events pushing this, including:

* My character not having any clean clothing, so you offer to let me borrow some stuff from the factory. However, it turns out that the only clothes in my size are for women. 

* You offer to let my character stay in your apartment to stop me having to sleep in the factory. 

* I have to dress in some of the outfits/lingerie for a photoshoot as we can't afford a model. 

I would also like elements of slice of life in this too. And I would love to hear some of your suggestions for these events too!

My main kinks are romance, feminisation, incest, cumplay/bukkake/gokkun, D/s (with me as the s) outfits and lingerie, build-up, free use, taking orders, name calling and group sex. My limits are u18s, excessive pain, non-con and skat/watersports.

I try to respond at least once per day, although sometimes real life will get in the way. I write in the first person present, and generally try to write detail, liking around 3 paragraphs per response (although of course that fluctuates). I'm looking for a partner who appreciates detail, and who really likes to develop their characters. In your response, I'd like you to include a little bit about your character, your kinks, and how you imagine this RP developing. Please include a decent amount of detail in your response, just so I can gauge whether we'd work together. I usually leave prompts up a little while before replying, so don't feel the need to rush your response. I'll try and reply to everyone, but short and undetailed messages probably won't get a response.

N.B. and basically all of my past prompts along a similar theme are open too if they take your fancy!"

99qe9x,2,2018-08-23,I (27F) am unsure if I want to commit to a long-distance relationship with my partner (30M),calliecart73,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/99qe9x/i_27f_am_unsure_if_i_want_to_commit_to_a/,"Hey redditors.Throwaway account because I’ve been discussing this with friends but would love some perspective/advice from people with similar experiences who aren’t biased towards a particular outcome. I’m new to this, and it’s fairly long, so please bear with me!

I met my partner 5 months ago, and we clicked instantly. After approximately 2 weeks of dating, I found out that I got accepted into my dream Masters Program in a different state (6 hours away by car). I let him know immediately, and told him that I would understand if he didn’t want to continue. We both took time to think about it, and decided to see where the relationship would go. Our attitudes were pretty similar – even if the relationship was short-term, we thought it was worth a try, and we’d approach the distance question later on. 
 
The distance question is now looming and causing us both a great deal of anxiety. It’s going to take me a year to finish my Masters program, and the job opportunities in the city where I’m from are few and far between. Career-wise, it would be more logical for me to job-search in the city where I go to school, but I am flexible and am willing to move anywhere where I can find something stable (and in my field). Relationship-wise, I think a connection like the one we have is very rare for me, and I am not ready to quit, even though I know the odds may be stacked against us. I think giving long-distance is worth a try, and I’m willing to put the effort in to make it work.

However, we’re both concerned that it’s pretty early in the relationship to be making the commitment of being in an LDR for a year (and potentially longer depending on internships, etc.). He is staying in the city he is based in indefinitely because he has a great job in his field and really enjoys his current lifestyle. We’re both worried that we might invest all of our emotional energy into an LDR relationship for a year, only to decide that we’re going to stay in our respective cities, which would undoubtedly hurt a lot more than breaking things off now while we still have the opportunity to preserve a friendship.

I’m torn because I honestly cannot picture my life without him in it (even though the relationship has admittedly been short), and as I mentioned previously, I’ve been looking for someone like him for a long time. He’s torn because of the uncertainty that will follow my Masters program, and he’s unsure that I’ll be moving back home, which makes him extremely hesitant to commit to something that might be doomed to fail. I absolutely respect his POV and would hate to force him into a situation that he doesn’t want to be in. I would consider moving home if there was an enticing enough job there and if our relationship became more serious during the distance (it’s serious enough now, but it’s still early).  

Is it worth it to do a long-distance trial run and see how we feel? Or better to break it off now while we’re in the same city? We’ve talked about breaking up during long-distance, and he prefers not to drag something out and then have a breakup conversation over the phone while I’m in the middle of an extremely demanding program. 

On the other hand, a part of me believes long-distance could be good for us and make us stronger, and that we’re doing all this worrying for a situation that is quite manageable if we both commit to it.

Neither of us knows what to do, and I fear that we’re both blinded by how much we like each other and aren’t looking at this from the most logical point of view. I know long-distance situations can be received negatively on these subs, but any input is appreciated!! 

TL/DR: Boyfriend and I unsure about committing to long-distance because I’m going away for a year and we’ve only been together for 5 months. Do we try a LDR?"

99rivc,1,2018-08-23,"Me [22 M] with my GF [21 F] of 2 months, she wants to take a break and I don't know what to make of this.",EfficientWind,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/99rivc/me_22_m_with_my_gf_21_f_of_2_months_she_wants_to/,"Some backround first, we used to date back in 2016 for a couple of months but had a falling out and broke up, I really don't remember the exact details but I was seeing a psychiatrist and wasn't all there emotionally from all the meds, she went back to her ex of 2 years and we never spoke again. I haven't seen my psychiatrist or taking any meds in 2 years, I feel great and all that is past me. 

She hits me up back in June and asks me out, I agree and we start dating again under the premise that se ""wants to do things right this time"" I'm all for this and ready to invest myself in this relationship, she also assures me that her ex is no longer in the picture and we can start working on our own thing, I of course am very cool with all this and we become a formal couple.

The first few weeks of the relationship she's really invested into me, texting me and calling me and being generally all lovey-dovey, I of course reciprocate this and we're both having a fantastic time, until 3 weeks ago when she stops being this way. I of course ask her about her change in attitute towards me and she assures me everything is fine, that she's just busy with school and work, I take this well and wish her the best. 

Well, yesterday she texts me and says that we ""need to talk"", we were on the phone for a couple of hours and discussed several things. First she made me know that she wasn't very pleased with me due to certain things, the first being that I have a car and she doesn't and she expects me to pick her up on all our dates, now she lives on the other side of town, I go through an entire tank of gas every week and gas is very expensive where I live, we are both students and I have no time to work, I say that I can make an effort to pick her up everytime if she contributes with some money for gas, she's semi-on board with this.

Now, her job is an internship where she only has to do 180 hours, she would be done by next week, but she wants to continue in order to make money and get more experience, I'm fine with this and make clear that we can make some time to see each other during the weekends. She also wants to see her friends and I want to see mine but we're willing to compromise. She tells me that she's feeling pressured by me to spend all her free time with me, I reiterate that this is not the case and that we can reach a compromise.

The third thing we discussed was the fact that she wasn't all lovey-dovey with her texts and calls anymore, she assured me she was just busy and didn't have the time to be that way all the time, I just asked her to make a bigger effort on that and she agreed. 

Now, this all sounds pretty cool right? We're communicating and reaching agreements, and things feel great, until she hits me with this: She says she's not completely over her ex, and that she has been feeling depressed quite lately, she wants to set her heart right before continuing with me, and wants to take a break, again I'm okay with this, as long as we're not allowed to date other people while on our break, she agrees to this, she says she will contact me when she's ready, and we hang up.

All these issues she had kept to herself for weeks and just closed up to me, despite me asking several times if anything was wrong, I urged her to share these things with me so we could solve them one by one, instead of them piling up inside her and having her explode on me like this. 

Now this is where I'm feeling conflicted, I have absolutely no idea how long a ""break"" is, and I'm not sure if I want to wait months for her, I'm scared that when the break ends she will still keep things to herself instead of sharing them with me and that we will drift apart eventually, this is honestly way too draining on me and I feel terrible about the whole thing. I feel like she hasn't considered my feelings at all, what does r/relationships think about this whole ordeal?

tl;dr: Gf wants a break due to some issues that she kept to herself for weeks, I agreed to compromise and solve them but she still wants a break to sort herself out, she still has thoughts about her ex and is feeling depressed and will be talking to someone.

Thanks for taking the time to be here! I'm applying to law school this fall, and, as a caveat, I've done my research, talked to multiple lawyers, and decided that, despite the grueling nature of the profession, I want to do it. 

As I research programs, I notice that some have fairly robust courses in bioethics, health law, and health policy. Given my background in philosophy, especially ethics, I've always found ethical issues in medicine very interesting, but I don't know any lawyers who work in or around healthcare.

I'm curious about a few things:

1. What do lawyers working in or around healthcare do? (I realize this is a very broad question, but I'm curious what career avenues there are).

2. For those career avenues mentioned above, what does the practice look like from day-to-day? I'm particularly interested in in-house positions with hospitals or healthcare providers.

3. If a law student is interested in working in this field, what things should she do to prepare herself in terms of courses, internships, 1L/2L summers, etc.? 

4. As a fledgling lawyer, what sorts of jobs are individuals interested in this field trying to get to set them up for more niche positions, like an in-house position in a hospital?

Thanks again for your time and answers! My apologies if my questions display any ignorance, hopefully what I'm asking isn't terribly vague."

I have a really good professional job that has a lot of decent marketable skills, but I started with an internship and have been there a little over a year now and still am not making enough money to move out.

My mother has not been as much of a help as I originally thought she would be. I feel like the only responsible person in this household. All she does is work, go out with her friends, and watch tv. 

I do all of the cleaning aside from the dishes, all of the grocery shopping, all the cooking, take care of the dog that she got and said would be a ""family effort"" but doesn't take care of aside from buying him food. As well as raise my son. And she's a massive hoarder as well, so cleaning is a day effort, not a few hours kinda effort.

I've tried talking to her about all of these things these past 4 years. Trying to propose simple solutions to make it easier on me. (Taking shoes off before we enter the house so I won't have to vacuum as much, reduce the amount of stuff she buys so there is less clutter, that kinda stuff) but she doesn't go for it.

Her idea of problem solving is to make up excuses why she can't do it, lie or ""misremember"" an incident, place blame, essentially anything she can do to not do anything, and justify not doing anything.

There's been many more incidents of her not being responsible throughout the years, and a lot of rage worthy behavior. But I can't fit it all one post without making this more of a novel than it already is, so I'm just going to talk about these last few weeks or so.

The house has got a massive flea infestation. I've been spending my weekends trying to combat it on a budget but to no avail, it's getting worse.

The other day I was at my boyfriends house and saw a flea on his pillow. I was mortified. I'm transferring fleas now. I'm worried that I might infest other places as well. Like my office or my sons daycare. 

I brought a game plan to my mom, capstar the dog, flea bomb the house, and then regular flea medication to prevent this from happening again. I can't afford all this so I need help.

She had every excuse in the book. ""People can have fleas without having animals. Just because your boyfriend had a flea at his house doesn't mean you brought it there. I haven't seen many fleas.""

After an hour of trying to get through to her how much of an importance this is, I gave up and went to the store and packed up the dog and she took my son to his great grandparents and I flea bombed the house.

I knew this wasn't going to rid them all in one night. But I was hoping it would be a breather for a bit so I wouldn't have to worry about it until tomorrow when I get my next paycheck and can really afford to crack down on these fleas.

It seemed to work alright. Until I got home from work this evening. They're still here in large amounts. So while I thought it would be a breather for maybe a week or so, it was only a one night breather. Ontop of that my mother ate some cooked chicken I have saving in the fridge for my son and me tonight. As well as some slices ham I bought.

But to top all of this frustration off, I realized my favorite rug that I had left outside to wash (because of the fleas) was gone. I asked her where it went and she said she thought I put it out to take to the dump so she took it to the dump two weeks ago. I've been so busy with work and flea combat I hadn't even noticed it wasn't where I had left it.

I'm so crushed. I bought that rug for $2 at a yard sale and it was a very beautiful, expensive rug that I was excited at the thought of putting it in my own place one day. I honestly loved that rug.

I can't even find anything that could come close to it online. Even if I did have $600 to spend on a new rug.

I'm frustrated at my life in this house. But there really is no escaping it in the immediate.

But the more frustrating living with her gets, the more I've noticed myself fall into a depression about it. I'll be fine for awhile and then stuff like this will happen that just makes everything so much harder on me, and I just feel so hopeless. Like this will never end. And all I want to do is crawl into my bed and forget about the world.

The ironic thing is, my sons never really been much of a hinderance in my life. I know that's where people tend to point when they talk about struggles and hinderances. But actually he's a very easy going kid for the most part.

My own mother is the one that makes everything so much harder to accomplish. 

I don't want to raise my son in a household like this. But I also don't want to jump out before I have my ducks in a row.

I'm just honestly feeling so defeated right now.

I sit with the rest of the lots waiting to be put up for auction in a small room behind the stage. Gradually the room emptied as, one by one, each of us was summoned to be taken out in front of the crowd of wealthy potential owners. Through the door we heard the gasps and applause get louder with the improving quality of each lot and buzz of excitement and anticipation growing. Eventually I was left alone, and naked, waiting to be brought in front of the expectant crowd... Quite why I am up for sale is up for discussion but once you buy me I have to do what you tell me to.

I like the idea of being tied to a chair and blindfolded while a woman has her way with me. I'm not talking about heavy BDSM but more being teased and used and giving up some control. When I think about this I'm usually naked but I can be clothed if you prefer. For instance you might be my girlfriend adding a kinky new side to our relationship, you might be her friend who wants to fuck me instead, maybe you are my boss and you decide you want to use the new intern or maybe I don't even know who is doing this too me. Let's talk and see what we come up with.

**For F:**

This can start a few different ways. I will outline a few but feel free to jump in with anything around this theme. The exact setting is up for discussion; I have written it like it is ancient Rome/Greece but it could easily be Egypt, the Aztecs, the Inca or a more modern cult setting. I live in the temple of the God of fertility. I have been specially chosen by the priestesses to be part of the ritual for worship. To bring peace and fertility to the city the priestesses must make ""sacrifices"" the most common of these is that they must cum on the alter and to do so they use me. I have been blessed with a huge cock and an ability to stay hard for as long as needed and cum over and over again, perfect for busy program of worshipping that happens each day. Powerful women also come to the temple looking to worship and give their offering to the Gods. It is my duty to help them reach the heightened state of consciousness needed to do so. It is also said that my cum has special properties and women will come to receive a blessing from me (and publicly so all can see how pious they are). Some even see me as a physical embodiment of a God or demi-God myself; to be worshipped and pleased in my own right. Or you could, of course, play the Goddess herself come down to Earth to fulfil some prophecy or accept a sacrifice. Again this very up for discussion and there are many different ways this could be taken with me playing either a submissive (preferred) or dominant role.

To the generic ""why do you want to work for us"", ""what's a weakness that you have and how do you overcome it (or whatever)"", what mistakes should I try to avoid and what ""weaknesses"" could be redeemable qualities or how should I be thinking to answer a question like that as well as possible?

99sqs9,1,2018-08-23,SAT Study Plan,TestMagic,TestMagic,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestMagic/comments/99sqs9/sat_study_plan/,"Updated and expanded our overview of an SAT study plan. [Also online at TestMagic](https://enroll.testmagic.com/blogs/news/sat-study-plan).

Today I’d like to focus on one of the most common questions that I hear from parents who are contacting us for the first time: How to prepare for the SAT. It’s a very general question, and there are countless specific details that could change your approach. For example, some students will focus on an extracurricular more than on their SATs (such as a sport or an internship), while others may try to get the highest SAT score possible to maximize their chances at a few colleges they’ve selected. That said, the following should be a good starting point for starting to develop a good study plan during your SAT prep, and at the very least for some people, will help make sure you don’t get caught by surprise when the time comes to apply to college.

## Summary

* Tenth grade is a pretty good time to start prepping for the SAT. It’s not too early or too late.
* Before you start, get your baseline SAT score.
* Work from [official SAT tests](https://enroll.testmagic.com/blogs/news/download-official-sat-practice-tests).
* Practice, review, repeat.
* Keep track of your performance, scores, questions missed and questions that confused you.
* Expect to spend anywhere from 10 to 1,000 hours prepping. (Or more. Or less.) At the very least, be sure to take at least one practice test before the real thing!

If you need more information, read on.

## When to start prepping for the SAT

While it may sound like a pretty straightforward question with a clear answer, the optimal time to begin your SAT prep really depends on several important factors, including, for example, what colleges you plan to apply to and how much you need to improve your score. For example, someone who’s scored 980 on the PSAT and hopes for a 1300 is quite different from someone who has scored a 1400 on the PSAT and wants to raise her score to the 1500s. However, in a word, earlier is usually preferable to later, and you want to be sure to leave plenty of time to prepare comfortably.

First, let me give some background on what I see here at TestMagic. If you averaged out the school grade during which most of our students start prepping for the SAT, you’d see that a good chunk of our students start in the middle of 10th grade. Of course we have plenty of students who start in 11th grade and a small number who start in 12th grade, and we also have a few students who start even earlier, such as in 9th grade. (Of in middle school--we have had a small number of students who want to take our course in middle school for a couple of reasons. The two main reasons for preparing for the SAT at such a young age are one, preparing to take the SAT for CTY, Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth, and two, visiting from abroad for the summer and taking our course while here in San Francisco).  


But again, the most common age to start for our students is sometime in 10th grade. This is a nice time to start because it’s plenty early in case something comes up (Oh no! I need to study more trigonometry!) and starting in tenth grade also alleviates some of the pressure of junior year, when students typically feel the most stressed, especially near the end of the school year, when final exams, AP tests, SATs, ACTs, and SAT Subject tests all happen around the same time.

Oh, every now and then we work with people who have only a couple of weeks to prepare, sometimes because they didn’t realize it was such a big deal to get ready for the test or because they’re too busy. It goes without saying that this situation is less than ideal. (But not hopeless!)

## SAT study plan

First, I just want to say that there are a zillion variations of the plan that follows. I suggest you try what appeals to you, and add in whatever I’ve not mentioned that works for you. (Remember, every student is different, and what works for one person may not work for another.)

### Step 1: Establish your SAT baseline

Your SAT baseline is your starting SAT score or current level. Knowing your starting score is vital for many reasons, but especially if you have a goal score or will be working with an SAT coach.  


Quick note: I suppose theoretically you could start your SAT prep without taking a diagnostic SAT—you would just do your prep, and when you take your first practice test, you would get a score. But a lot of people like to know their level so that they have a clearer goal.  


To get your baseline SAT score, simply take an official SAT under simulated conditions—[download an official SAT](https://enroll.testmagic.com/blogs/news/download-official-sat-practice-tests), set aside about four hours in a quiet place, and time yourself for the test. Be careful about not getting distracted! Consider doing it with a friend to keep yourselves honest, so to speak, or go to a public library to take it. (TestMagic also administers practice tests onsite if you feel like you might get distracted at home.) In some cases, using your PSAT score will work almost as well to establish your baseline, especially if you’ve taken it recently.  


Finally, record your score somewhere, either on paper or in a spreadsheet.  


Now to the next step—the actual studying.

## The SAT study plan

It goes without saying that the bulk of your SAT prep will consist of studying, reviewing, and practicing. Whether you’re self-studying or studying with a course or tutor changes the process and materials a bit, but in general, you’ll need the following:

* The official SAT tests (fundamental)
* A good SAT manual (helpful, if it’s well-written)
* A good dictionary (crucial; my favorite is the Merriam-Webster dictionary, but the American Heritage and Random House collegiate dictionaries are fine for test prep)
* Explanations of the questions on the official SAT (helpful)
* Video tutorials, such as those found on Khan Academy (helpful, but not vital)
* Nice tools—a pretty (physical) notebook or computer document, a nice mechanical pencil, a nice eraser, a graphing calculator, snacks, a water bottle, headphones, etc.

Your basic study plan involves a combination of learning the material on the SAT (with books and videos), reviewing, taking practice tests, and reviewing those.  


A sample plan of study would be something like this:

* 4 hours: Take your diagnostic SAT
* 2-4 hours: Review diagnostic SAT; find areas to improve
* 2-10 hours: Review SAT concepts in your manual or from the test. For example, study vocabulary, practice combinations and permutations, review punctuation rules, and so on.
* 2-10 hours: Study SAT concepts again. Repeat two to six times.
* 4 hours: Take your next practice SAT to see how you’ve improved.

That is the basic cycle of improving your SAT score.

We’ll begin the discussion of materials in a bit. (I will do more in-depth reviews in the future)

## Variations of SAT prep

I started teaching in 1991, and one thing I learned right away—teachers need to employ a variety of techniques in the classroom. Here are some variations on studying that I’ve successfully used:

* Take the test untimed. This is actually an extremely helpful technique, and I highly recommend that at least in the beginning of your SAT prep, you take a couple or several tests with no time limit. Why? Simple—it’s important to know which questions you’re capable of answering regardless of time limit. For example, if you can get through a tricky math problem in ten minutes, then you should work on improving your speed. But if you can’t do it at all because you haven’t studied that material in school yet, then you would need to work on building your foundation for the test.
* Instead of taking a full-length test in one go, try taking each section one by one. Some people can’t concentrate for four hours straight. Or if they can, they certainly don’t enjoy it. If you find that you can’t sustain your concentration and mental energy for four hours, consider taking the test a section at a time. (But of course, you need, at some point, to get used to taking the SAT under realistic conditions.)
* And here’s a radical notion: During school, starting in middle school, pay extra attention in class, especially your English, History, and Math classes. Take notes, look up words you don’t know, and review everything. Do that for a couple of years, and you’ll be really well prepared for the SAT. And your grades should improve as well!

## What materials to use

There are a lot of great materials available, but unfortunately, there are probably more materials that we sometimes call “score harmers”, i.e., material that was hastily thrown together just to sell books and contains inaccurate information. (The big publishers are most guilty of this, though now in the age of the Internet, they’ve gotten better in this regard.)

Of course, [the official SAT tests](https://enroll.testmagic.com/blogs/news/download-official-sat-practice-tests) are vital. You can’t prep without them.

For books, videos, courses, tutors, online courses, etc., check reviews online. From my experience, most teachers genuinely want to help their students, so don't fear reaching out to people to ask questions or gauge the fit with the tutor you might work with. Of course, [TestMagic offers live SAT courses in San Francisco](https://enroll.testmagic.com/search?q=sat+prep).

I know this section on materials is a bit short, but at some point in the future, I’ll review some of the better known options to review them.

I've looked around online but feel like a forum is the best place to ask about this situation. I had an internship in Switzerland earning me a couple thousand dollars (equivalent) that is currently sitting in a Swiss bank account.

My question is: what should I do with the money and the account going forward?

If I decide to close the account and move the money back to the US, what are some best practices to avoid getting hit with wire transfer fees or bad exchange rates? I have a small credit union in the US right now, so I anticipate having to get a bigger bank to be nice to me about this. Any suggestions on banks that are good about foreign currencies?

Should I consider keeping the money and the account there? I travel to Europe frequently, so there is some benefit to having an account with Euros access (can use both Swiss Francs and Euros with it), however I don't anticipate living or working in Switzerland again in the near future. I am involved in a German organization that involves having to transfer Euros a few times a year, usually resulting in fees when I use my US bank. But I'm not sure if those few occasions are worth keeping the account over.

I would appreciate the perspective of anyone who's been in a similar situation or can offer some advice on these topics – thank you!"

I'm new here and I needed an anonymous place to open up and get some advice so I can continue to stay strong on my journey to become mentally and emotionally healthy again. 

Some background (Long, so thank you for your patience): I'm a food scientist and I am known to be highly ambitious, intelligent, organized, hard working, and friendly. The companies I have worked at have not been the best and I didn't realize I have been struggling with depression through work-related issues throughout the past 3 years until just a few months ago. At the first company I have worked for, I dealt with a number of different issues. I supervised a team of technicians and one purposely jumped the chain of command and tried to get me and my manager in trouble with our boss (director) about an issue that was not brought to our attention. People from other departments never worked well together and almost everyday, someone from another department would not be happy about a document I emailed out, so the receiver would point out something minor she wanted me to change and cc everyone from management and the CEO of the company. I grew anxious and nervous throughout my time there, which didn't help because I ended up making so many more mistakes with a good chunk of documents I sent out weekly...and this resulted in frequent emails sent to me about things I needed to change with management cc'd. My boss was a nightmare to put up with. Everyone is a little afraid of her and she grew to dislike me more and more overtime, and I never knew why. She went out of her way to avoid me during the company xmas party, even though I called her name and was walking towards her so I could introduce my BF and meet her husband. She'd get mad at me about the most minor things. She hovered over my shoulder (not uncommon) one day and said my desktop wallpaper was inappropriate, to which I replied that it was one of the windows' default wallpaper. Overall, culture was very toxic, you couldn't trust most people, management was poor, and no bonuses are given. The company didn't give performance reviews at all, but I was shocked when my boss pulled me into HR's office out of nowhere. She had a document filled with a list of seemingly ridiculous minor reasons (more like excuses, really) that proved I was not performing well at work. Looking back, I felt they nudged me to quit. My boss said I didn't seem engaged anymore and I was so naive and also so sick and tired of dreading work everyday and being terrified of what my next mistake would be that I said I'm just not happy there. My boss said, ""If you're not happy here, I don't want you working anymore."" So I ended up quitting and I was forced to leave that day. I felt a sense of relief for a short period of time, but I also sunk into depression feeling worthless. I took a paid Research &amp; Development internship job at a larger, more stable company with the hopes of getting a full-time offer. I loved the team and my boss and I really proved to them how great I was at the job. I was treated like a FT employee and did a lot of cool research and experiments on food products. I blew the R&amp;D and marketing team away with my presentation of what I was working on. My internship was supposed to end in August after my internship presentation. But I was kept around as an intern for longer and my director kept telling me they want to hire me FT and that they are working on it. December came and I felt like I was being taken advantage of, so I went to HR and she was shocked to find out that I was still working as an intern when the internship program had ended in August. HR told my director that she had to make a decision: to either hire me FT or let me go. I later found out my director had known all along that they didn't have the budget to hire me FT and just wanted to keep me as cheap labor. I was given an end date to my internship and I wasn't allowed at team meetings anymore or be treated like a FT employee.

Today I work at a company that has a laid-back, very open, team-oriented culture and a seemingly friendly and nice CEO. A lot of various issues that I grew tired of include: inappropriate racial and sexual remarks from both management and employees, no growth or promotional opportunities because they feel people would think they are too good for a task ""beneath them"", lack of accountability, unorganized way of handling things, and prioritizing customers over employees. I've really demonstrated my leadership by stepping up, working to bridge communication gaps between departments and within the department so we could work better together towards a common goal. I took the time to understand the company's vision (or lack of) and mission statement and geared my focus to doing so many extra things to improve processes. I have had a lot of one-on-one sessions with my CEO, sharing my insight and ideas for improvement and it's discouraging when he says they're a start-up and the way I do things is too systematic and structured and too catered to corporate companies. I really hate being told by him that I need to be more aware of my place when I strive to do more than just what I do in my department. We are switching from a new ERP software system to another and my team is supposed to complete data entry by a specific deadline. I've pulled in the bulk of our work by staying late, but nobody is willing to do the same. I talked to the project manager about how I can empower everyone else to help out. Big mistake -- he told his employees that my team is unwilling to stay late to help and it sounds as if I complained about them. Maybe it was me being naive, thinking that our conversation would be confidential. But I later learned he's a blabber mouth and no one should tell him things they don't want shared. At our last project meeting, he asked me in front of all my teammates of who has pulled the bulk of the work for our part of the project. I didn't see it coming at all, but I said it's a team effort and we are struggling right now and would need help from his department. Over the weekend I came up with alternative ideas to help get my team to reach out deadline. I knew they didn't want to physically stay late, so I had to get creative. I checked in with my team on my ideas to ensure we will be on the same page and added some things based on their insight. I initiated a meeting with the project manager about it and asked that we have the CEO and my department VP sit in on it. I handed everyone a table of ideas I carefully put together and had spent a lot of time on. Everyone is there and I went to grab my VP. I came back in horror to find that everyone had started the meeting without me! I worked hard and over the weekend (unheard of in my current company) on presenting these ideas and leading the meeting. When I walked in with my VP, I didn't even know where we were in conversation and I felt extremely frustrated and disrespected. I didn't even have a chance to go through my hand out as the project manager totally just dominated the rest of the meeting. I work very differently -- I add more structure to meetings, but I felt completely anxious as we did what we usually do at meetings...run it without a clear agenda and it's just totally unorganized. I have ambitions to be an empowering and influential leader, and it takes so much energy out of me to plan strategies and plan for leading these meetings. I'm extremely shy, so seeing that my chance to run a productive meeting to set the right steps towards the deadline and get management's approval on it really sucked. I almost went home after the meeting and wanted to cry. Instead, I took a walk and listened to some pick-me-up music. I came home still frustrated and angry. Worst part is, my team knew how hard I worked on everything, too and they still continued the meeting without me. 

I've been carefully looking for another job for the past few months. I'm a lot more cautious about taking an offer now based on my experiences and have rejected opportunities because the culture seems toxic or the management team is poor. Any advice on how to cope while I'm still at my current company? I'd hate to see myself let it eat me up one day to the point where I quit (not ideal)."

I felt calm after that like it was just normal. Eventually I won’t have to put myself and I’ll be stealth and look and feel cis, but until then I have to out myself. I could have done it in an email, but I’m proud of myself for being who I am. I go to school in a liberal city so I don’t expect any problems. And even if I do who cares. I’m a giant of a man lol 5’4” 350# and I have the look of... I can kill a rabid wolf with my bare hands and not break skin... constantly. I have perfected resting bitch face. My mom always tells me to smile. 

The reason I posted in ftm is because I’m very excited about having my first internship and making money. I can start saving for top surgery. I can’t wait till I can walk around and not have to constantly feel like there’s two giant globes hanging off my chest that I’d like to just slice off myself. If I could, I would. And being able to walk around the house without a shirt on...that’s like going to be a dream come true. It’s happening. Might not be tomorrow or next year, but it’s gonna be soon. 

Let’s get this semester started! LOL 😆 "
99td03,9,2018-08-23,Career Advice - I Feel Stuck and It's Terrible,ex0th3rmic,MechanicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalEngineering/comments/99td03/career_advice_i_feel_stuck_and_its_terrible/,"Gonna try and keep this short: I'm 24, graduated college last year with BS in MechE. Currently, I'm doing software programming at a place that is 7 hours away from my family and gf. Not sure what exactly is going on, but I've been feeling a lot more... anxious? not myself? not energetic? I think it has something to do with the location, but might be because of the work too (I've been doing busy work for the past couple months). 


I'm *desperately* trying to get a job in the other area, but my resume and experience is definitely on the weaker side. I've had one decent internship, and a co-op that was more or less a shitshow (since I was the first engineer they took, and it wasn't structured at all. No set manager, expectations, help, etc. Still tried to make the best out of it, but I could only do so much). Sounds like that is pretty common, but it leaves my experience undesirable. 


After getting my fourth rejection letter of the week, I've about had it. I've tailored my resume to the job, emphasized my skillset and how it pertains to the job, and still not an onsite interview. Normally I would just shrug it off, but this whole thing is getting me down big time. I feel like I have no confidence, no matter how much I fake it over the phone. 


I guess this boils down to my 2 questions: 1)How do you keep spirits up after getting multiple rejection letters and if you're in a bad place mentally? 2) Are there any things that I can do that would set me apart from more experienced candidates? Like online certifications, Youtube lectures, etc? 


I'm getting pretty desperate at this point, and I really don't want to sell myself short if I'm planning way ahead into the future.  "

99tn48,1,2018-08-23,53 [M4F] looking for a possible long-term rp partner (A few ideas to get us started...),Kevin4938,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/99tn48/53_m4f_looking_for_a_possible_longterm_rp_partner/,"1. I'm a senior executive at a company where you work as an IT analyst. I've been surfing the web at work, exploring femdom sites, looking for a chat partner or maybe even a playmate. Of course, I'm not supposed to be doing any of this at work. My posts are clear about what I'm curious about - generally milder things like light bondage, blindfolds, light punishment like spankings, and maybe being shared by a domme and her (female) friends. You check my history and you see I've chatted with a few people but nothing ever developed. You just happen to share some of the same interests so you set up a profile to reply to my posts anonymously. We set up a meeting and I arrive at your studio to find you dressed as a domme, with a mask and wig concealing your identity. It's only after I'm tied that you reveal who you are. I am blackmailed into becoming a client of yours, with our sessions becoming more intense and my limits tested over time.

2. As a variation, you're my secretary. I make the mistake of leaving my office to get a coffee without locking my screen, when you come in to leave some papers for me to sign. You see my screen, explore a bit, smile, note my user name and the site I'm on, and set up an account for yourself to arrange for us to meet.

3. I'm your older neighbor. A busy man, successful, but not too tech-savvy. You're the nice-looking young lady who lives in a condo down the hall. I know you work in IT, and I've asked you to help me configure a new home network. You get everything set up but I don't know that you also installed a back door to remotely monitor my activity. You discover my browsing history and decide to have some fun. The next time I'm surfing, I see a popup message: ""I know what you've been looking at"". I'm a bit concerned, but I close the message. A couple of days later, there's a knock at my door. I open it and see you standing there, and invite you in. All you say is those same seven words: ""I know what you've been looking at"". Then you add, ""I'm here to help you explore."" 

4. I'm a rich executive. You're a poor college student. We find each other on a site that specializes in matching up people in our situations. We meet, and agree to enter into a ""mutually beneficial"" relationship. Things go well, but after a few dates, I suggest trying something a bit different - tying you. You seem hesitant, so I say you can tie me instead if you're more comfortable with that. You still seem uncertain and tell me you'll think about it, but on the inside, you're smiling. When I arrive at your place for our next date, you answer the door dressed as a domme. You lead me to the spare bedroom in your apartment, which you have set up as your ""chamber"". 

5. I'm a senior manager at a large firm. You're an intern, assigned to my department one or two days per week as part of your college education. We start off with a civil, professional relationship, but after working together on a couple of projects we become more friendly and eventually we start flirting, joking about getting together after work and having fun, but nothing ever comes of it. I don't have any personal photos in my office and I don't wear a ring, so you have no way to know that I'm married and have been for some time. As an intern, you're invited to office functions like the Christmas party. You arrive a bit late, and see me with someone new, and discover that she's my wife. You manage to sneak away before I know you were even there. The next week, when we're flirting, you suggest we go to your place after work. I accept, not realizing you're serious, and just thinking it's part of the game. Eventually I make it over, and you tell me to relax in the living room while you change into something more comfortable. I hear you speaking as you walk down the hall, saying ""why didn't you tell me you were married?"" When you step into my field of vision, I see you dressed as a domme.

9. I come in to a small pub and see you sitting alone. After a while, I offer to join you and you accept. We chat, making small-talk, even flirting a bit, generally getting along well. When the  manager announces that it's closing time, I am surprised to hear you suggest that we go back to your place, and I accept. After another drink, we wind up in your bedroom, where you tell me to get comfortable, while you step behind a screen to change, coming out dressed as a domme.  It turns out you had this planned, and I was tonight's prey.

-----

If you're interested in seeing where any of these openings could lead, or if you have anything similar in mind, feel free to send me a message. I'm hoping we can turn this into an ongoing chat/role-playing relationship, either by private messages here, by email or something interactive like Skype or Yahoo. I am not going to share voice, pictures or camera, and I won't expect you to either.

Asian guys are the worst about that! It's like they just see me in, like, a ponytail or a short skirt and they assume I'm an airhead. But the mean ones are always so much smarter than me...maybe I am kind of dumb.

Are you a scholastic Asian guy? Did you roll your eyes after I asked a stupid question in class? Did you get stuck with me for a group project? Are you a foreign businessman making the best out of a 4-hour flight next to a dimwitted teenager? Are you the boss who hates me because HR made him hire a girl intern? Are we collaborating on research—but you're doing 95% of the work because you know I would just fuck it up?

But I'm not totally useless. There's probably a better way to bear our time together.

A Microsoft recruiter contacted me on linked in and said some stuff about how my profile was nice, and asked me to apply for two internships(Explore and SDE) before they hold onsite interviews at my school (CU Boulder).

I am going into sophomore year in Computer Science with a 3.7 GPA and honestly I don't know where I stand among my peers at other schools. Honestly, I just code everyday and work on projects with my friends because I find it fun, and I also practice leetcode and hackerrank every day. I don't really see these things as a chore because I like doing them, and its better use of my time than playing PUBG and other games all day.

The main thing is I'm not sure where I stand amongst the pool of applicants(like people from good schools) and whether or not I have a chance as an South-Asian male. I have already applied regardless. I was just wondering if I could talk to someone who has worked at Microsoft and if they could review my resume/linkedin/github and tell me what my shot at this is. Also how long would it take MSFT to get back? She told me to apply by the 25th, but the thing is that the application only opened the 17th, and the on-sites start the first week of September. None of my friends or anyone else that I know have gotten this message, so I am actually curious of how many people will apply.

99us5f,163,2018-08-24,"Hero society is shit - the toxicity of the hero culture, the complacency of the average civilian, and why the fuck doesn't UA have an in-school therapist?",badooga1,BokuNoHeroAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/99us5f/hero_society_is_shit_the_toxicity_of_the_hero/,"Warning: long post with no tl;dr ahead.

Now, despite the edgy title, keep in mind that this isn't an attack on Hori or anything. On the contrary, it's a testament to his amazing writing and worldbuilding skills.

At a basic level, learning to be a hero is no joke. It's stressful, difficult, and is a huge burden for anyone to have to handle. The very idea of having not only your life, but also the lives of others in your hands is burdening and can't be handled by most. Even 911 operators (at least those that have told their stories on Reddit), while not directly in the fray, endure extremely tough calls and either become desensitized or have to quit if they cannot handle it.

Now, take that burden and put it on the shoulders of *15-17 year old kids*. As in, high schoolers who are going through the most fragile and malleable portion of brain development (that only ends well into their twenties), who are going through puberty and wild hormonal imbalances, who have not yet been completely introduced to the world of adults. Seems like most teens wouldn't want to shoulder such a burden just to be a hero, right? On the contrary, they are literally volunteering en masse to become heroes due to the hero-oriented culture that has firmly rooted itself in society, which I'll get back to in a minute.

Think that's bad enough? How about the fact that UA has been repeatedly attacked by villains, even to the point where one student got kidnapped? Hell, what about the time where seven UA students took part in different internships that ended in one of the hero employers being killed and one of the students losing their quirk?

With this in mind, I'll put this here - why the fuck doesn't UA (or any other hero school) have an in-school therapist? It's not like mental health is something they don't acknowledge (they've talked about it repeatedly, such as with Bakugo and his pride), but why is it that instead of having specialized mental health professionals, these schools delegate their tasks to the teachers? Aizawa and Midnight are the *last* people I'd feel comfortable sharing my problems with. I'm aware that there might be counselors that they haven't shown yet, but it sure doesn't seem that way.

In any case, the fall of All Might was a huge wake up call for society as a whole. The pillar of justice, especially when carried by one individual, can easily shatter if that individual is removed. However, the lessons learned from this catastrophe seem to be expressed in an extremely unhealthy way. Rather than acknowledging the link between heroes being the main/only source of justice and the fragility of this justice (which ties in to the discussion of quirk restriction later), the hero educators instead double down on the burden resting on the students' shoulders, in which they declare that via hero teams, this new generation of heroes has to inherit the hero landscape that All Might left behind.

This isn't to say that hero teams aren't better than having single heroes that society relies on for its justice, but doing this still doesn't address the core issue of the problem, which is a culture that necessitates a specific class of heroes that have a near monopoly on justice.

Can't Ya See-kun is a perfect example of this toxic hero culture in action. Like for real, a super powerful villain demolished a bunch of buildings and brought the number ~~two~~ one hero extremely close to death. Yet, just two days after High End's attack, Can't Ya See-kun has already been turned into a [commodity](https://i.imgur.com/QJ929YM.png). Hell, even the Hero Killer himself was commodified, [as seen in the S2 finale](https://i.imgur.com/Pf6wBRB.jpg).

I mean come on, they literally name them ""heroes"" and ""villains"". These terms are used to paint a black and white picture of society, despite the fact that these ""villains"" can have legitimate motivations and these ""heroes"" can be corrupt and money-seeking as Stain described.

So far, we've gotten into the heroic side of this hero culture. Then there is the *complacency* side of the culture. Shigaraki is a great example of this complacency in action. As a child, despite people seeing his cries for help, they ignored him hoping that a hero would come to his aid. Instead, it was All For One that came to his aid. Years later, during Shigaraki's visit to the mall to get some chap stick, he discusses the complacency and almost mindless nature of civilians with respect to the threat of being attacked. While Shigaraki's perception is obviously warped due to his murderous nature and All For One's influence, the issue still stands that most of society has been rendered completely helpless and inert by this culture, where they all completely rely on heroes to a dangerous point. If someone were to be attacked, would they be able to defend themselves, or would they rely desperately on the intervention of a hero?

The other part of this is that this society of heroics is restrictive. It breeds villains that feel oppressed and alienated from society, as with the League of Villains. Not to say that the existence of villains is the fault of hero society (obviously, villains like All For One came about simply due to the manifestation of quirks themselves), but in a strange paradox, it's as if the hyper-focus on heroics causes the strengthened continuation of villains as a whole. After all, if there were no villains anymore, what would happen to this hero society, and the huge empires of capital built upon its commodification?

While there is no clear solution for anything here (or at least, nothing that I'll be getting into), I truly hope that Hori delves way further into the decadence of hero society and its culture (which is one reason I like Vigs), as he has been doing for some time now, as it's arguably one of the most interesting things the show has to offer.

Sorry if this post has inaccuracies or mistakes in it. I hastily wrote this at 1 am as I couldn't get my mind off of it. What do you guys think?"
99usok,1,2018-08-24,[Letter],DomV18,JordanPeterson,https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/99usok/letter/,"Dear Dr. Peterson, 

&amp;#x200B;

I’m not sure if you’ll ever get to read this, as I’m sure you receive thousands of these messages, but I felt it necessary to thank you. My name is Dom, I’m 22 years old and was born and raised in Australia. Prior to the last two years in particular I was an outgoing, social high achiever with a fierce determination to succeed in everything that I set my mind to whether it be music, schooling etc. However, upon graduating from university, and as the result of a few prior events which I will outline, I found myself with a complete loss of identity and a shameful shell of my former self. 

&amp;#x200B;

In 2013, during my final year of high school at age 18, my grandfather suffered a series of strokes leaving him unable to use the right side of his body, issues with memory and the most difficult part for me, a complete loss of speech. My grandfather was the rock that held our family together, he was quite literally loved by all that met him and being the eldest grandson I learnt valuable life lessons that made me the man that I am. Aside from my father, he was my source of wisdom, kept me in check when I was acting out by reminding me of the importance of family and responsibility and I could always rely on him to give me clarity of thought when I needed help. Seeing the strongest man in my life being put in that position and in particular having him lose his speech meant that my anger and frustrations with the world rose to new levels, I had lost my guiding voice at a pivotal moment in my life. This also combined with the fact that he had recently celebrated his 60th anniversary with my grandmother and having to watch her in so much pain whilst this happened contributed to my anger, bitterness and frustration. For as long as I can remember I have been an over thinker, either fixated on analysing past events and how I would’ve done things differently or obsessing over decisions that could affect my future. When this happened all I could do was think about my grandfather and I regrettably turned to alcohol and cigarettes in order to stop myself from this constant thinking. At this point I really did not care about my health and I also found it extremely difficult to sleep, I still suffer from that now. As the years went on, I was accepted into university, met who I thought was the love of my life, watched my grandfather make  an incredible an recovery despite never regaining his speech and mobility and things did get a lot better, but then I graduated. 

&amp;#x200B;

Despite the fact that I achieved significantly high results in my final year, I decided to undertake a degree in international tourism and event management because I wanted to travel, no one in my family had travelled much at all and my grandfather had never gone on holiday overseas and would never have the opportunity to so I wanted to experience the world. Whilst studying I volunteered constantly, had various paid positions and completed three unpaid internships whilst working, maintaining my relationship and playing music in bands. I understood the importance of networking and did so so that I could gain a competitive advantage when I graduated. It has now been a year and a half and I have still been unable to get a full-time position and during that time everything began to unravel again. 

&amp;#x200B;

Having worked since I was 14, this was the first time that I had found myself completely without a routine. I sent off countless applications and was continually told that I lacked the necessary experience for entry level positions or did not receive a response at all and this completely destroyed my confidence and faith in my own abilities. I would spend ridiculous amount of hours scrolling through social media making self comparisons to everyone I graduated with and those that seemed to be doing extremely well or finding jobs and knowing personally that they did as little as possible at university really made me even more bitter and resentful. I just couldn’t understand why I wasn’t being given a chance and I quickly developed a victim mentality, feeling like the world both owed me and was against me. I was now regularly buying packets of cigarettes, nearly a pack a day, drinking obsessively during the week and putting myself in shameful situations, at my heaviest weight in my life, would wake up and be unable to leave the bed for hours and felt myself losing all passion and motivation for things I used to love. At this point my extended family was also coming apart and the only solace I had was with my girlfriend and her family who I felt were my own. 

&amp;#x200B;

After two years together my girlfriend left me which was made worse for the fact that I was made aware she did so because she had developed feelings for a friend at university who I had met on several occasions. Her family and I were so close that he father texted me saying that he felt like he had lost a member of his family. I realise now that being in that relationship was all I had and I had come to rely on it as part of my identity, I felt my identity had been completely stripped away again and didn’t know who I was or what I stood for anymore. A couple months following the break up, a friend of mine who suffered with mental illness passed away from an overdose and following that, in July of 2018, my grandfather had a final stroke which he was pronounced brain dead, all we could do is wait with him until he passed away four days later. I have always been a fan of yours Dr. Peterson and in a way I looked to you as that guiding voice I had lost when my grandfather lost his. Prior to my friends overdose and my grandfathers death I purchased your book and it had such an effect on me that, I really do not know how I would’ve gotten through that period without the knowledge and guidance you gave me. I think what I appreciated most was the honesty and the fact that you did not sugarcoat that there will be challenges in life and it is up to no one other than me to take responsibility and make it through. It reminded me of my grandfather and what he would’ve said to me and having read your book it reminded me somewhat of what I already knew inside, what I had lost. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am still currently unemployed but my mind is clear now and I am making steps to being the man I want to be. Thank you Dr. Peterson for all your work, what you have taught me, reminding me of knowledge I had lost and for being honest with us all. I think that’s what I and most people appreciate the most. If you for some miraculous reason find yourself reading through this entire thing with your busy schedule I would very much appreciate it but regardless I wanted to send this so that when I get back to you in years time I can look back on what I sent you and I can show people just how much of a positive impact you have on peoples lives. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you Dr. Peterson, 

&amp;#x200B;

Regards,

I have about 2-3 years left before graduating. I’ve always wanted to serve since I was young. My grandfather served, my father served, and pretty much a good portion of my family has served so I would like to follow in their footsteps. Now for the advice there’s 3 main reasons I would like to serve now and leave university for later. The first reason being I made some poor financial decisions and now I’m in some pretty bad debt which I’m continuing to pay off. The second reason is I feel like if I graduate first and commission as an officer into the Marine Corps the things I learned in university won’t necessarily translate over as I don’t think there are any Officer MOS’ that are coding/programming in Java/C++/C#/etc. However if I enlist now and do my service I can head back to school later and finish up my 2-3 years then get an internship while in school and etc. Finally the third reason is that sometimes I get into huge verbal and sometimes but very rarely physical altercations with my parents and this is what led me to the Marine Corps recruiter in the first place as I no longer wanted to stay at home and get into anymore altercations. Since then however things have cooled off with myself and my parents but I know it can ignite into something at a moments notice. Anyways these are the 3 main reasons I’m looking into enlisting now and returning to university life later. I’ll just say Thank you to all of you in advance who are able to leave some kind of advice."

Hello everyone. This is my first time posting here and I wouldn’t post if it weren’t out of desperation. I am a 21 year old college student working an internship in NYC for the summer. I have to pay my first and last month rent tomorrow for my housing for the semester and do not have the funds to pay due to a family emergency that occurred recently. If you’re able to help me out, it would be very much appreciated.

I start my dietetic internship in a couple of weeks. I’m super excited to finally apply the knowledge I’ve gained in my undergrad and to learn even more new things! That’s being said, I’ve always wondered how difficult it would be for me to find a job after. Right now I think I’m mostly interested in the clinical route, but I’m open to other avenues of dietetics as well. Has anyone ever found difficulty finding a job after internship? Or how long after did you find a job after completing your DI.



(More about me: I am 23 yr old male, living in Canada)

I started from after the National Championship game.

Here are the last two years done by a different guy. He got banned for fighting the good rivalry fight so he asked the MSU sub if anyone wanted to take over. I will say that I'm not including highly upvoted content from scandals... unless it's hilarious scandals like naked sharks or something. Seems like we didn't have as many highly voted shitposts this offseason(I think I grabbed more wholesome content than my predecessor too) .

99y4t0,6,2018-08-24,Advice on how to survive workplace psychopathy,ro211,intj,https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/99y4t0/advice_on_how_to_survive_workplace_psychopathy/,"First off, excuse the misuse of psychopath &amp; sociopath. Also, English isn’t my first language so if you’re going to point out any mistakes, please do so politely.

I’ve started working in a soil chemistry / phytochemistry lab in May and after almost 4 months, I began to realise why there was such a high turnover rate of research officers (on average once every 2 years) here: it’s because my boss (F, 55 y old) is very likely a sociopath / psychopath. It was something I realised today when she called me in to sit and observe an “interview” with an intern who started sobbing heavily after 10 min because my boss practically called her hopeless and stupid. I was feeling guilty af for not standing up for the intern but the thing that astounded me was how callous my boss was. She even revelled in it saying afterwards “I didn’t know why she would break down; I wasn’t criticising her at all” and then related an episode in which she similarly made her sister cried during a seemingly innocuous phone conversation.

This episode was just one of the many red flags she displayed during my relatively short time here. Others include badmouthing almost everyone she’s working with or are collaborating with, never admitting her fault when a lab analysis didn’t go right and straight away blaming the research assistants (who were just following her vague instructions), bullying the clerk (who she knows is a single mother) by asking her to stay back after office hours because she needs some stuff photocopied, and frequently asking me to write up research proposals but dismissing any follow ups I made. The last bit is what’s making me want to quit because it’s really frustrating when I can already imagine what sort of results I will get for each study and how I’m going to write the papers but could never get anything off the ground.

I told a couple of colleagues who’ve worked there longer that I wanted to quit and they insisted that I stay because I’m the one who’s going to take over from my boss when she retires in exactly 3 years. They’re really hoping I would break the cycle since my boss seem to be fond of me (for now) and the other staffs see me as someone who’s capable of leading them. Additionally, I’ve started collaborative research projects with several researchers here so I’d hate to end them abruptly without closure. 

I decided to try and stick around until she leaves but 3 years is a really long time - at least for a 28 y old. In order to make this happen, I will need to figure out a strategy on how to get along well enough with my boss. I didn’t have anyone at work who I can trust or to turn to since I’m new at the workplace so I thought I could try and reach out to my fellow INTJs. Have any of you been in a similar situation or at least had to deal with an authority figure who you suspected to be a psychopath / sociopath? Any advice or insights?

P/S: Here’s a review paper on workplace psychopathy if you wanna know more about it and yes, she does fit the descriptions of a psychopath / sociopath I’ve come across so far: r/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359178912001218"

99z21r,1,2018-08-24,[M4A] A Failing Factory Owner Meets a Desperate Intern [Feminisation] [Long-Term] [Plot Driven],clip-clop,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/99z21r/m4a_a_failing_factory_owner_meets_a_desperate/,"Your family has run Garrett's Fabrics for almost 100 years now, passing down from your grandfather, to your father, to you. In the past things had been good. One of the biggest regional manufacturers, you'd produced clothing that had ended up on catwalks and had been spotted on celebrities. 

But in recent years, things have taken a turn for the worst. With growing competition from multinational companies, people aren't buying local. Why spend $100 on a pair of handcrafted jeans when you can get a pair made in a sweatshop for less than half the price? Although your factory used to have hundreds of people working there, now there's less than a dozen, and even they're struggles to justify staying here when their pay-cheques are so inconsistent. 

One night, another sleepless night going over the paperwork trying to make these impossible sums turn a profit, I knock on your door. I'm a young man fresh out of a degree in business management. Fresh out being the operative word, seeing that I ended up dropping out of my course. With no real qualifications, no real family or friends in the local area, and a desire to make *something* out of my life, I've been knocking around every business in the area trying to get *some* sort of opportunity. I don't even want to be paid, I just want an internship, a chance to prove myself and get some experience. 

However, neither of us could predict how our business relationship was going to pan out. We don't know that we'll find a gap in the market, a gap for luxury lingerie and naughty outfits. We don't know that, having no money to hire models, *I'll* be the one trying them on for the photo shoots. And we don't know that, growing ever close and closer, our relationship will go from strictly business to one of pleasure...

Hi there! As the prompt suggests, I'm looking for a long-term feminisation prompt between a failing business owner and a desperate intern. 

I always think these prompts work best when we both have some sort of vulnerabilities. Your character will be a failing business owner (male or female, although the former is preferred) who is stressed out from having to deal with these pressures. Perhaps you've got divorced because of the stresses of the job, or your relationship is on the rocks. My character will be a young man (18+) who is effectively homeless and penniless, looking for any opportunity to get my life started. I like the idea of my character viewing yours as a father figure, with the more sexual implications that brings, but if you're not open to that I understand. 

I would like this feminisation and character development to be long-term and gradual, with our characters naturally changing. I envision a couple of events pushing this, including:

* My character not having any clean clothing, so you offer to let me borrow some stuff from the factory. However, it turns out that the only clothes in my size are for women. 

* You offer to let my character stay in your apartment to stop me having to sleep in the factory. 

* I have to dress in some of the outfits/lingerie for a photoshoot as we can't afford a model. 

I would also like elements of slice of life in this too. And I would love to hear some of your suggestions for these events too!

My main kinks are romance, feminisation, incest, cumplay/bukkake/gokkun, D/s (with me as the s) outfits and lingerie, build-up, free use, taking orders, name calling and group sex. My limits are u18s, excessive pain, non-con and skat/watersports.

I try to respond at least once per day, although sometimes real life will get in the way. I write in the first person present, and generally try to write detail, liking around 3 paragraphs per response (although of course that fluctuates). I'm looking for a partner who appreciates detail, and who really likes to develop their characters. In your response, I'd like you to include a little bit about your character, your kinks, and how you imagine this RP developing. Please include a decent amount of detail in your response, just so I can gauge whether we'd work together. I usually leave prompts up a little while before replying, so don't feel the need to rush your response. I'll try and reply to everyone, but short and undetailed messages probably won't get a response.

N.B. and basically all of my past prompts along a similar theme are open too if they take your fancy!"
99z9oq,2,2018-08-24,Job Search on OPT,wilson688,h1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/h1b/comments/99z9oq/job_search_on_opt/,"Hi everyone! I have recently graduated and looking for a full time job with 3 years of experience in Software Development. I have applied over 200+ jobs and either I get rejected over an email saying ""we can not provide sponsorship"". 

I am currently working as an intern at a small company, they have good amount of work but they already told me that they can not give me a full time. And this internship is going to end next week, but they said they would help me out to extend my internship for one more month. 

I am unable to decide what to do next. My options are 

1. Join a consultancy, get good training and get a job via them 
2. Just continue working for this company (internship) for one more month while looking for jobs. 

Both of these have their disadvantages 

1. If I join consultancy it means that I can not find job on my own as I will under contract 
2. If I continue my internship, which means working 10 hours a day leaving me no time to work on my job search/ give my 100% only on getting a job. 

Please guide me! (sorry for my bad English) "

All I said was, “It’s actually not that bad here.” It was a very tinny telephone, so maybe you didn’t quite understand: all I meant was that I liked the hot food, the central heating, and the luxury of a lumpy bed that wasn’t by the side of the road. I meant, “Don’t worry, Dad, it’s not like the movies.” I wanted you to know that I wasn’t about to be shanked. But I guess you heard “I like being in juvie,” so you went nuts.

&amp;#x200B;

Dad, if you had asked me over the phone why I did it, I wouldn’t have been able to tell you. Not because I didn’t want to, but because I didn’t know how to explain the hole inside me. Why did I steal that car and put two thousand miles on it? Well, why do people swim? Because we love the water? No. Because we don’t want to drown. And in our hometown, I was drowning, Dad. 

&amp;#x200B;

It was never about the car, really. The car was just--there. A convenience. And I never really cared about where I was going. All directions were away.

&amp;#x200B;

When you flew two thousand miles to retrieve me from juvenile detention, you were worried that this was the start of the end. That some integral part of me had been knocked askew--that next it would be drugs, or older men, or stripping. And I don’t blame you. What were you supposed to think? Your respectful, obedient, introverted, straight-A daughter, who was a virgin and had never tried drugs in her life, who did the dishes every night without complaint, had become a felon literally overnight. Christ, you probably thought I’d gotten brain damage!

&amp;#x200B;

In retrospect, hey, maybe I was a little brain damaged. Dad, do you know what my greatest worry was that day? My hair. Juvenile detention doesn’t allow hair dryers, you see, and if I don’t blow dry my hair it gets frizzy. While you worried that I was going to start a career in prostitution, I worried that the other inmates thought I was ugly.

&amp;#x200B;

Consider all I have done since. I graduated high school as a valedictorian. I have a full ride in college. I still get straight A’s. I’m graduating without debt. I’ve won a prestigious internship. But I am afraid that when you look at me, all you see is a teenager in an ugly orange uniform and frizzy, frizzy hair.

&amp;#x200B;

Please look at me, Dad.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to think that the worst thing I’ve ever done was running away or stealing that car. Then I thought it was enjoying being caught, because surely I was meant to be suffering in juvie, wasn’t I? But now, I think the very worst thing I’ve ever done was hang up that phone. 

&amp;#x200B;

So Dad, I’m sorry. Every time I look at you, or hear your voice, or think about you, I am back on the other end of a telephone line, unable to explain to you that I am going to be okay. And I’m sorry if every time you think about me, you still wonder whether I have a screw loose or something.

Me being 18 thought this was a good idea. My parents had the money to pay for my tuition no matter what school I chose. Well here I am, with an Associates in Applied Science in Music and Technology that costed the same as a Bachelors at a University. And even better, none of the courses transfer to any other school...Everyone who graduates from this school either goes back to school, or just works retail. Its all very sad. Ive done a few unpaid internships at sound studios but they all take advantage of people chasing their passions and give them janitorial work. One teacher at the school who quit even told me they tried to pass students in the more expensive programs (my program) so they wouldnt leave. I have a huge interest in programming and have been learning C++ and upping my maths everyday. Im thinking about pursuing a Computer Science degree but I only have 13k in savings, no scholarships, and my parents arent going to help me anymore. I dont know what to do. I currently work at Publix and plan on using their tuition reimbursement while stocking money away but I keep hearing horror stories about student loan debt. Im kicking myself for not just choosing a traditional University to begin with when I had the privilege of a support system. I need help on if this is even a good idea or what to do that would be financially smart. Im 23 if that changes anything. Also I would rather not do coding bootcamp. I definitely want the degree in CS. 

TL;DR: Went to for profit music school that parents paid for. Cant find any jobs besides unpaid internships that turn into nothing. I want a CS degree but I only have a job that pays 11.50 an hour, and 13k in savings. I cant decide what step to take next. I want to avoid student loans at all costs"

&amp;#x200B;

All I said was, “It’s actually not that bad here.” It was a very tinny telephone, so maybe you didn’t quite understand: all I meant was that I liked the hot food, the central heating, and the luxury of a lumpy bed that wasn’t by the side of the road. I meant, “Don’t worry, Dad, it’s not like the movies.” I wanted you to know that I wasn’t about to be shanked. But I guess you heard “I like being in juvie,” so you went nuts.

&amp;#x200B;

Dad, if you had asked me over the phone why I did it, I wouldn’t have been able to tell you. Not because I didn’t want to, but because I didn’t know how to explain the hole inside me. Why did I steal that car and put two thousand miles on it? Well, why do people swim? Because we love the water? No. Because we don’t want to drown. And in our hometown, I was drowning, Dad. 

&amp;#x200B;

It was never about the car, really. The car was just--there. A convenience. And I never really cared about where I was going. All directions were away.

&amp;#x200B;

When you flew two thousand miles to retrieve me from juvenile detention, you were worried that this was the start of the end. That some integral part of me had been knocked askew--that next it would be drugs, or older men, or stripping. And I don’t blame you. What were you supposed to think? Your respectful, obedient, introverted, straight-A daughter, who was a virgin and had never tried drugs in her life, who did the dishes every night without complaint, had become a felon literally overnight. Christ, you probably thought I’d gotten brain damage!

&amp;#x200B;

In retrospect, hey, maybe I was a little brain damaged. Dad, do you know what my greatest worry was that day? My hair. Juvenile detention doesn’t allow hair dryers, you see, and if I don’t blow dry my hair it gets frizzy. While you worried that I was going to start a career in prostitution, I worried that the other inmates thought I was ugly.

&amp;#x200B;

Consider all I have done since. I graduated high school as a valedictorian. I have a full ride in college. I still get straight A’s. I’m graduating without debt. I’ve won a prestigious internship. But I am afraid that when you look at me, all you see is a teenager in an ugly orange uniform and frizzy, frizzy hair.

&amp;#x200B;

Please look at me, Dad.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to think that the worst thing I’ve ever done was running away or stealing that car. Then I thought it was enjoying being caught, because surely I was meant to be suffering in juvie, wasn’t I? But now, I think the very worst thing I’ve ever done was hang up that phone. 

&amp;#x200B;

So Dad, I’m sorry. Every time I look at you, or hear your voice, or think about you, I am back on the other end of a telephone line, unable to explain to you that I am going to be okay. And I’m sorry if every time you think about me, you still wonder whether I have a screw loose or something.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m okay, Dad. But I’m sorry--I just don’t know how to explain that to you. "

Just wanted to know - does anyone else struggle with big-time changes changes in their lives? Stuff like careers, homes, etc. 

Today, I finished my 6 month internship in the wonderful city of Copenhagen. The work was great - lots of research, writing and programming tasks - and they treated me really well there. In fact, I hardly felt like I was an intern at times. My suggestions and reccomendations were often taken into account by the senior people while making decisions and I had a lot autonomy in scheduling my work. It got a little hectic at times and the hours were long, but it was a good experience. 

However, due to visa restrictions it's not possible for me to get a full time job at this company. As my current visa is expiring, I have to leave the country and leave in a month or so. 

It's kind of freaking me out, to be honest. I've been living in the country for more than two years now. Although that might not seen too long, it was really a transformative and therapeutic experience for me. Here, I got out of my horrible relationship, worked on myself and started some interesting new hobbies. I successfully got rid of a lot of toxic people (from back home) and lived a relatively isolated albeit satisfied life. 


And now, I have to move back home. 5000 miles away, back to the place that emotionally crippled and almost broke me. Of course, I don't have those people in my life anymore, but those memories  still remain. In addition, I'm quite overwhelmed because I have to do a lot of things before I leave: close my bank account, sell some of my larger possessions (including my electric guitar :'/ ) and start applying for jobs... It's filling me with a lot of dread. 

Of course, it's not all bad - I'll be living with my parents for a bit, both of whom are super supportive (esp. my mom) and I'll be meeting my grandparents again, who I adore. 

It's still a little difficult to take in. Would you guys have any suggestions as to how I can manage myself? I'd love to hear about your experiences, if you'd like to share them. I'd really appreciate it. Thank you!

We have been together the past couple months (more than 6 but less than a year). We both go to the same university, which is how we met. I'm a rising senior and she's a rising junior, but I will be taking the semester off to work an internship across the country. After that, I'll be at school for one more semester before I graduate and take a full-time job.

Overall, things have been pretty good, she's a great person and we get along well. There's nothing really *wrong* with our relationship in the traditional sense. We don't really fight much or anything, and I enjoy spending time with her.

I just have this feeling that I'm too young. When we started our relationship, the real world seemed so far away, but now it seems right around the corner. I don't want to start my life in a committed relationship, I feel like it will hold me back. And since I'm going to be gone for this semester, I don't think it's worth putting both of us through a LDR if I know it's going to end a few months after I come back anyway.

The problem is we made plans for me to come visit her at college the next two weekends. It'll be my last chance to see my school friends before I leave, so we planned to go to some parties together and I'd stay at her place. To make it worse, the second weekend is her birthday. I don't think it's right for me to play along, *especially* through her birthday, and then tell her how I feel afterwards. I know it's best to do these kinds of things in-person, but I just don't know when or how.

**tl;dr: I am feeling restless in my relationship and think it's best to end things. I want to do it in person, but I'm really not sure how.**

Any advice?"

I am however going for my masters. 

2. Just finished an internship with  a cool company (I’m a data scientist) and also a musician while I love my beginning stages of work life, I want to do things for God as well, such as making Christian music, again I see others excelling, and I really want to glorify God. Also I’ve learned a lot in college, I used to be a very influenced person and Quiet and walked over, and take crap from other people, until I tapped into my knowledge and what God has given me, i used to get picked on in school a lot when I was younger I’m still not perfect and I still have to pay attention in this life so I can be on guard to whoever thinks they can talk to me any kind of way, I stay quiet and to myself  unless I’m with family and friends (I’ve noticed it’s harder for people to gauge a quiet person) so I use that and my knowledge, manners, and disposition as a “weapon” to command respect. I just stumbled across this sub and It blew my mind, I try to read everyday.

So Henry Cavill recently(ish) mentioned For Tomorrow as an example of a what he'd like to do in MOS2. So I've done a brief adaption of how that I felt it could work in the DCEU. I put in Cyborg cos I want him there, and think he works in the story, as it would help to give Clark someone to bounce off. I reduced the time-period from a year to two weeks cos I feel that's the maximum time the League would wait before some kind of intervention. I threw in Baka cos I love the little guy and he's a merchandising juggernaut in the making so WB would eat it up. Also Lana Lang and Jack Olsen cos why the hell not (and I could picture a cute little friendship between Jack and Baka), and after the character assassination of Lois Lane in JL I was desperate to give her something to do and not be generic-girlfriend/damsel in distress bullshit that's an insult to Amy Adams as an actress. I put The Phantom King in there cos it'd make sense that there'd be someone in there with prior knowledge of how to survive the Phantom Zone. As there are no GLs on Earth as-of-right now, that was changed. Had to swap Zod for Faora for obvious reasons, and also cos I'd like to see her back and she has very good motivations. I like the idea that this is not another ""end of the world"" scenario, and instead still has stakes but some very unique and more personal ones.

EDIT #3: Maaaaaaybe Lex gets trapped along with everyone else in Metropolis and has to work with Lois. He'll never be a good guy but it'd make for some good character development to see him toe the line a bit more

Casting wise, a lot of the major players are already done

- Lana Lang: Marianne Farley. If you haven't seen Imaginaerum you are missing out, it's basically the best Tim Burton movie he never made. She's great in this, and I'd like to see her get a big-time gig
- Jack Olsen: Quinn Lord. This is Jimmy Olsen's younger brother who's basically filling out the role he would've done had he not.....you know had his head blown off. Also saw him in Imaginaerum, also good in that and the right age for the role as I imagine Jack as Lois' intern before the whole Vanishing incident happens
- Xa-Du/The Phantom King: an unknown. Whoever it is is gonna be in a lot of prosthetics so better to go with an unknown who will accept not having their face shown. Maybe get some famous voice actor in like Troy Baker for the voice work whilst someone else does the physical stuff
- Atomic Skull, Neutron and Radion: Low level villains acting as henchmen for the Kryptonians so they're not prisoners. good for action sequences and not much else

SUPERMAN: METROPIA (working title)

- Clark is in space rescuing a satellite crew as their space station starts to plummet to earth. After this he flies back to Metropolis when he notices something is up. He gets back to find 90% of the population has mysteriously disappeared; including Lois.
- Two weeks later, and Clark has been searching the globe non-stop. Vic/Cyborg finds him in Kazakhstan and tries to talk to him. “I’m Superman. I’m supposed to save people. Yet I couldn’t stop this.” Vic offers to help, and they head to the Fortress of Solitude.
- Meanwhile, Lois is leading a group of rebels in their mysterious prison city. They head for the main tower block to get a message to the outside world. They make it and get the message out but are arrested as they do so. They are taken to Xa-Du, The Phantom King, ruler of the Phantom Zone. He admits he is one of those responsible for bringing the people of Metropolis there and reveals his conspirator; Faora.
- Clark and Vic are in the Fortress of Solitude working through all the data. Suddenly Vic picks up a signal; Lois’. She tells them the Metropolitans are trapped in the Phantom Zone along with a few others from around the world like Baka, and the co-ordinates of their location; Metropia. It is an area of the Phantom Zone Clark turned into a “nuclear bunker” should it ever be needed. Clark wants to go there immediately, but Vic is hesitant; it seems like a trap, and could be a suicide mission. Clark doesn’t care, and they briefly fight until Vic has him in a position where Clark cannot beat him. But Vic eventually agrees to, seeing his distress. They open the portal and enter the Zone.
- Meanwhile Lois and the rebels are imprisoned. Xa-Du had revealed he had let them get the message out to trick Kal into coming to them. Jack Olsen arrives with Baka and breaks them out, and they almost make it but are caught again by Atomic Skull, one of those who submitted to the Kryptonians for “freedom.”
- Clark and Vic fly towards the location. But then they are caught in a Phantom storm that tortures them psychologically. They then reach Metropia. Vic scans the area, finding Lois and the others. Clark flies straight to them, but is knocked down by Faora. She tells how after Clark sent the remaining Kryptonians to the Zone in the Black Zero event, they were driven insane. But after meeting Xa-Du they plotted their revenge (Xa-Du was the first prisoner of the Phantom Zone, condemned by Jor-El). He details how they broke into Metropia and used the technology to teleport the population of Metropolis there. Faora then reveals their plan; to detonate a device that would normally kill the humans. But as this is the Phantom Zone, they can’t die. Instead they’ll be in a perpetual state of purgatory; they won’t die, but they won’t be alive either. If they were taken back to Earth they would die, leaving Clark with an impossible choice; let them suffer in the Phantom Zone or bring them back only to die. Then Vic reveals he was hiding (cloaking tech), and frees them all. They race to save everyone, whilst Clark fights the other Kryptonians. They get everyone through the portal, as Metropia starts to collapse. Clark offers to save Faora, but she refuses, falling into the abyss. Clark is pulled back into the real world. He returns to Metropolis and finds everyone is home. He and Vic talk; he admits he pities Faora and the Kryptonians despite what they did and understands their intentions. He then flies through Metropolis as the end credits roll."

I've even got a JNMom all my own (although she's mellowed into a Just Sometimes with age and distance). Anyway, from watching this community interact with spouses who are enmeshed with JNMILs, I thought maybe your words could help me shake myself out of it. 

XDH and I met about seven years ago when we were both abroad teaching English, and from the jump we were incredibly codependent. We were placed in different parts of our host country, a solid day's travel on terrible buses between us, but we texted literally all day every day and talked online every night. Even that early we fell into patterns of inequity. 9 times out of 10 he insisted I travel to see him for visits, rather than him coming to see me. I literally only *yesterday* processed that his stated reason for this (the fact that I had a roommate) was bullshit, especially accounting for the fact that his apartment was filthy. He refused to clean it despite my repeated statements that I couldn't be comfortable there and that the mess attracted pests (he had problems with ants, cockroaches, and mice).

It was also while we were in that country that we started what has proven to be the hardest element of this relationship to quit--roleplaying online. It started as a group thing, D&amp;D campaigns. We both had experience roleplaying more casually as well, and we started doing it one-on-one, just telling stories about characters we cared about. It was and (spoiler) continues to be satisfying. He had an online girlfriend from before Us who was involved in the roleplaying. We never really clicked but I tried to be her friend. She's important later in this story.

Since we lived in different parts of the country, we had to decide what to do about coming back to the US. And when I say ""we"", I mean that he decided that I would join him in his hometown so that he could attend grad school there (at the time I had no grad school plans of my own). I made a few attempts to convince him to apply to schools in my home state, but he won out. (In a healthy relationship, the decision would have made a lot of sense: his town had a MUCH lower cost of living, in addition to in-state tuition for him.)

So, after about 2 years knowing each other, I abandoned my beloved and beautiful mountains (where I had basically no support network, thanks JNFamily) and joined him in GrungyRustBeltville (where I had *literally* no support network). We got married about six months later in a backyard ceremony; our families weren't invited.

This is getting long, so I'll leave the marriage to some bullet points:

* I had to *beg* him to do any kind of housekeeping for literally all five years we were married. Early on in our relationship, he told me the reason he couldn't do the dishes was that my pleading tone of voice when I asked put him off.
* I worked 60-70 hour weeks at two different shitty jobs for the first year. He dragged his feet about finding work, and quit as soon as he started grad school. While he was in grad school, I: worked long days as a nanny; took online classes to prepare myself for my own grad school; and did ALL of the housework.
* I made literally 0 local friends. Spending time with anyone but him was discouraged. I was also the only friend he spent any time with. We were VERY isolated.
* He was finishing his masters and applied for PhD programs at the same time as I applied for masters programs. I restricted my applications to places that had the very specific PhD program he wanted. I got into every school I applied to; he got into none. His sulking and depression made it impossible for me to celebrate.
* We moved to MajorAmericanCity so I could start an incredibly demanding and expensive program ranked third in the country in my field. 
* He dragged his feet about getting a job in MajorAmericanCity. See, he never finished his masters thesis, and so he was (*in theory*) splitting his attention between that and job hunting.
* A year passes. We're living off my student loans. He hasn't found a job. He hasn't finished his thesis. He says he's taking care of me emotionally and it's a full time job. I'm still doing the bulk of the housework while taking 4-5 classes and completing clinical internships. He's playing video games.
* Second year of my masters: my clinical internships become full time; now I'm spending eight hours a day getting destroyed by a brutal supervisor in a medical facility and then traveling across the city to go to class all evening. He still hasn't finished his thesis or found a job. I curl up in a ball on the floor every day when I get home and just wail like a dying animal. He tries to comfort me. When it fails, he goes back to his video games. 
* I decide to spend Christmas in another state with a friend to send the message that I can't live like this. Like magic, he finds a job in retail shortly after I make that decision. Him getting a job makes things a little better. Then while I'm in the other state he asks me if it's okay if he and Ex Online Girlfriend (who was still a part of both our lives) roleplay about blow jobs. I'm flabbergasted. He promises to cut XGF out. We start couple's therapy.
* I graduate! Miraculously, he manages to make my graduation about me and not him.
* I have much more energy and happiness without grad school. Things are pretty okay for about a month.
* He asks if I'm okay with him roleplaying with XGF again. I say okay, but nothing about sex.
* You know where this is going.
* He totally roleplayed about sex with her.
* At least he sent me the log?
* This was July of last year, and it was the last straw. I told him to be out of the apartment by September 1, and I spent the intervening weeks crashing with a variety of friends. The divorce happened last April. We didn't stop couple's therapy until after it was finalized.

Now, the problem is...between all of the absolute garbage I just typed up...we were telling stories that really mattered to me. About characters that only exist between us and god fucking dammit but giving those up has been damn near impossible. A couple times a week I'm literally quoting fucking Brokeback Mountain in my head.

Against all odds, I managed to establish the beginnings of a support network for myself. He never did; I'm still *literally the only friend he has*. Every step of this process has been just a nightmare of prying him away from me. Honestly, I feel like I've broken up with him about half a dozen times at this point (telling him to move out, him actually moving out, asking him to give me his keys, telling him I want a divorce, telling him he needs to stop texting me so much...). Every time I think I've established some healthy distance, it seems to vanish. He doesn't even need to push my boundaries so much as gently blow on them. Example: I say I'm only comfortable hanging out in neutral territory, not in each other's homes. Later, he keeps talking about wanting to watch X movie with me. We end up watching it in my apartment. 

I guess I'm saying my spine is not very shiny. But it was so, so, so goddamn hard to take the steps I've already taken. And he wears me down.  And wears me out. And I'm still lonely and tired. If you made it to the end of this, can you give me some tough love?"
9a3h3a,100,2018-08-24,"Two [21F/22F] coworkers owe me [21F] a small amount of money that ruined the friendship, unsure what to do next",gothministr,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9a3h3a/two_21f22f_coworkers_owe_me_21f_a_small_amount_of/,"At the beginning of the summer, two of my coworkers that lived together (we'll call them Julie and Angela) approached me about needing a place to stay once their lease was up. At this point, I was friends with Julie, but didn't really know Angela. They offered to pay me $30 each to stay for three nights and four days, and after their stay, would move into a hotel for the remainder of their internship. I accepted. To me, $10 a night each seemed reasonable on both ends, considering that all their stuff would be temporarily moved into my one bedroom apartment and that I would most likely have to give them my spare key. $10 is far less than any hotel fare they could have ever gotten, so I did not feel in the least bit guilty for accepting this offer. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to the end of their lease. Julie and Angela move in, and we have a good time for the most part. We all watch Netflix, we drink beer and all go out together- it's a good time. They call it a sleepover, and I start to call it a sleepover, too. What else am I going to call it, a sublease? During their time, Julie briefly brings up that they could buy me food instead of paying me in cash, and I say no because I want to keep it simple. 

&amp;#x200B;

They move out and move into their hotel over the weekend. They don't discuss the payment with me at any point when we come back to work on Monday, and in all honesty, I kind of forgot about the $30. Something reminded me of the money that night, so (and this is where I went wrong), I venmo-requested them both $30. 

&amp;#x200B;

Shit. Hits. The. Fan. My friend Julie immediately texts me dozens of paragraphs about how I'm vile for requesting that money, how I'm billing them like a hotel and I ""called it a sleepover"" so they shouldn't have to pay me. I'm in shock. They ask me if I would have charged them if they hadn't requested the money. I tell them that it doesn't matter- they offered. I don't speak to Julie the next day at work. I was hurt, and honestly, I didn't want this to affect my work. I knew that if we talked during work, I'd get upset and be unable to do what I needed to do that day. Work is always my priority, not petty drama that shouldn't have even happened in the first place.

&amp;#x200B;

Julie pulls me aside after work and we talk in my car. I don't apologize for asking for the money, only for ignoring her once the situation got out of hand. Her apology is vaguely condescending (""this is just so you know how to act next time this happens""), and she swears up and down that she'll get me the money come next payday. I accept this apology to keep the peace and we try to mend things, but it's still awkward between us. 

&amp;#x200B;

Which brings us to the present day. The internship is over, and we're all thousands of miles apart. Payday just happened, and they both denied the venmo request that I sent out weeks ago, right after this payment. Julie wants to rekindle the friendship, but I just can't seem to forget what she said to me. It's not really about the money to me, I have thirty dollars. If I can't trust my friends to pay me what they owe me, who can I really trust? Ideally, I would like to get the money so that we can all forget about this, and so I can trust them again. Was I in the wrong for accepting their offer? Is this relationship worth salvaging? What steps should I take next?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR They both owe me $30 and think I'm awful for following through with it"

They've been dating for nearly two years now, and while I like (or maybe it's ""liked"" now, I'm still trying to sort out my feelings) her fiance, there's been some issues recently that make me worry about the future of their relationship. I need advice on how to best handle my role as best friend in all this. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Last year, friend's fiance dated another guy, in front of best friend. The guy (and most people) didn't know she was dating best friend since this is not a very gay-friendly community, but best friend knew it was happening. Fiance (then girlfriend) was told over and over by best friend that she was hurting her, but didn't stop. She went on a disney trip with this guy, which was something best friend had been saving for for months on her meager paycheck to take fiance on. Fiance's family loved the guy and fawned over him, in front of best friend, when they knew their daughter/sister was dating her as well. It was horribly damaging and I told best friend that I thought she should leave fiance if she didn't change her ways. It wasn't fair to best friend or the guy, who had no idea. Fiance dumped guy after best friend finally put her foot down, then proposed to best friend about 4 months later. If it was just this, I could move on. Okay, bad decision, hurt people, but maybe it'll work out.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Since then, best friend is not welcome at fiance's family home. Best friend and fiance live in an apartment but for holiday dinners or birthday celebrations best friend is not welcome. She usually comes to our place since she's practically part of my family after living here for eight months. Fiance has never stood up to parents or said that she is going to spend Christmas/birthdays/etc with best friend. She says it's because she doesn't want her extended family questioning why she isn't there. I don't know, this just feels wrong to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Fiance enjoys flirting/dancing which is fine, but she never tells anyone she's taken. I've seen her at parties claiming she's single while dancing with people. She lets strangers give her hickeys even though she knows it upsets best friend. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Lastly, fiance went away on a four-month internship this summer across the country. That's fine, it's a great opportunity. Limited wifi which means less talking but that's fine too! But best friend came to me this week telling me how she's scared because fiance made a comment about maybe \[fiance\] isn't bi, maybe she is straight. She's been making belittling, mean comments towards best friend and best friend stood up to her about this, says she thinks it's just hard being long distance. But also says this has happened weekly all summer.

&amp;#x200B;

Fiance is always nice to me, they've asked me to be their roommate but I've avoided this, thinking that 1) maybe I'm too close to them/the relationship to live with them and 2) that if something went wrong I would make it worse as obviously I'm on best friend's side. I'm sorry this is disjointed but I need help. I'm ace/aro and therefore have no romantic relationship experience at all, and I had a very toxic controlling friendship which makes me nervous that maybe I'm too enmeshed with best friend? Should I try to not worry and just plan on being there for my best friend? Does it sound likely that they're not going to last and if so, what do you say to someone who believes that they have given up family/community for this relationship and can't make it without it? I've been suggesting seeing a therapist recently to my friend who admits she's depressed.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Best friend's fiance doesn't admit she's in a relationship, cheated on best friend, proposed to her and is now making mean comments about friend and questioning whether or not she's bi. I need help finding the words to help best friend through this time.

&amp;#x200B;

NOTE: I know that Bi people deal with many harmful stereotypes about being ""a phase"", unfaithful, promiscuous, etc. I do not believe any of these and have many bi and pan friends who are not at all like this. I wanted to make that clear!"
9a4fem,31,2018-08-25,How my sister committed suicide,gunnry,SuicideBereavement,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideBereavement/comments/9a4fem/how_my_sister_committed_suicide/,"I have been thinking about my sister lately... I always looked up to her. She was the only person in my family who I felt truly understood me.  She was remarkable...I admired her and did my best to follow in her footsteps. 

Out of everyone in my family, she would confide in me the most. My parents weren’t the most reliable people on an emotional level and my other siblings didn’t really get along with her the way I did. We were friends. We had similar hobbies and interests, liked the same shows. Even after I came out of the closet to my family it was as if nothing changed. I honestly cannot recall a *single* time we had ever fought.

She was a kind soul. Her whole life she wanted to help other people. I remember playing “doctor” with her when we were little; she was always the doctor and I was the patient. She ended up attending nursing school and graduated. We were to happy for her!

Before she could actually practice as an RN she started to suffer from anxiety. It was crippling for her... overwhelming. I watched an amazing, outgoing, happy person transform into someone I could hardly recognize or understand. Before I knew it she became a recluse and started turning everyone away. She deleted her Facebook and stopped talking to her friends. She only talked to me and my parents unless our other siblings came into town.

We were still close at this point in time.. We would talk about pretty much anything that crossed our minds. We’d hang out and watch our favorite shows together, Bake tasty snacks or share recipes, plan trips... I knew she was hurting and all I wanted to do was be someone she could lean on I or talk to if she needed it. 

Flash forward to when things got really bad... it was my senior year in college and I was dealing with my own issues. I have always had a little bit of anxiety but when I took up an internship where presentations and being in the public’s eye were required I could barely function. I actually had to see a counselor to overcome these issues and while I was working on me... I had to put my sister on the back burner. I’d literally go home from college and panic nonstop about the next even I had to coordinate. 

Too ashamed to admit I was struggling I started to talk to her less. I just figured I’d work on myself and she’d work on herself and it would all just sort myself out. My lack in communication was interpreted as though I didn’t want anything to do with her though... her only lifeline/friend she felt like she could talk to was disowning her. 

Before I knew it she had locked herself in her room. She’d hardly ever leave and when she DID nobody else was around. The only trace of her being alive was the dishes she’d throw in the kitchen sink, typing on her keyboard, changing the channel on her TV... or her crying. Her door had a lock and god knows I knock every day trying to get her to come out but she’d never respond. 

This went on for literally an entire month.

Then I came home one day and she asked me to come in. She explained how she was really depressed and it was crippling to her but she could feel herself coming out of it and was starting to feel better. She was scared and didn’t know what to do. She had explain how she was going to start seeing a therapist and focus on feeling better. I was so happy she was sharing this with me because I was so worried about her and wanted to be there for her. 

She was hurting and she was scared. She went from barely leaving her bed for a month to trying with all her might to get her life back on track. She shared with me the reason why she was so depressed and I assured her everything will be ok. I was happy she finally was coming out of her room. I promised her every morning I’d make sure she got up and started her day productively. 

I made true to my promise and saw her every morning before I’d head off to class. Things were starting to feel normal again and I really felt like this dark time of her life was over. 

About a week later I came home, stressed about my internship but too stubborn to talk to about it. It led to my first fight with my sister. I regretted it immediately afterward but I decided to go to bed upset.  My mindset was that when I woke up tomorrow I’d apologize and everything would be fine. 

The next day I woke up and instead of holding try to my promise of making sure she got up every morning I opted to run errands in town and see her in the early afternoon. The whole time I felt awful and decided it was time for me to swallow my pride. I planned on telling her about my anxieties with my internship and that we can overcome our problems together. 

I made it back home and went straight to her room. Her door was cracked open and she was laying in her bed. Immediately I knew something was off because she *never* sleeps with her door open and it was closed before I went to run my errands.

She didn’t respond to my knocks or my voice. I let myself in her room and spoke louder. Still, no response. I could see her breathing so she must have been fine, right? I sat on the side of her bed and shook her by her shoulders. Finally her eyes open for a split second but close right after. I notice three empty pill bottles on her nightstand and the puzzle started to come together. 

At this point I am relatively calm still. 

“So she overdosed on her medicine but she is still alive. She will get treated at the hospital and she’ll be fine.” I thought. 

I called 911, explained how I think my sister might be overdosing in her sleeping medicine. As the paramedics are on their way the operator instructs me to try to wake her by jabbing my knuckle in the center of her rib cage, monitor her breathing, check for a pulse, etc... l started to panic while on the phone still and scream at her to wake up, I was hysterical... finally when the paramedics arrive they realize her blood is severely lacking oxygen and start to intubate her. 

I don’t know if I was still numb from the shock at this point but I still thought everything was going to be ok. She was going to be treated and she’d be okay. After the medics were at our house for about a minute one of them takes out his radio and says “activate life flight.” At this point, it sank in that this was serious.

She was airlifted to a hospital 70 miles away and placed in ICU. They determined that due to the drugs she overdosed on that she had suffered oxygen deprivation and had severe brain damage organ failure. We hoped dialysis would flush the drugs out of her system and she’d wake back up. She never woke up... she was in a coma for six days before we accepted she’d never wake up and decided to take her off life support. She died two days later.

I never wanted this to happen.... Yet I feel like I’m to blame, as if I told her to take the pills myself. I was her lifeline and I failed miserably. If we had never fought she wouldn’t have made this irrational decision, or I’d have been able to apologize before she did it if I actually kept my promise. 

Finding someone you’ve always looked up to overdosed and on the precipice of death really fucks you up. Especially when you found them when you came to apologize after a fight. I don’t know if she meant to end her life or if it was a cry for help, but retrospection isn’t going to bring her back. 

It’s been three years and this guilt/grief is tearing me apart. I lost my sister... my friend. Every day I wish she was still here and imagine what life would be like if she never died. Every time I feel like I’ve let go or moved on it’s like I force myself to grieve again. 

I have no clue what to do...

Currently I am doing my internship at a start up company whom shall remain nameless, and the CTO decides the contract extension post-internship up to me, which of course I would want to extend..

Now the confusion comes as I wanted to renegotiate the terms of contract in terms of salary offered, as I don't want to be underpaid nor asking too high, thus resulting in termination. My current salary as intern are around Jakarta UMR (IDR 3,6 mio/mo) and the technology I am using are Python and MongoDB. On the new contract, I'll be dealing with Python again and assisting mid-to-senior engineers and performing algorithmic research on various stuff supporting their business, which shall remain unmentioned.

I would like to hear from part time software engineers, preferably those who are still in college, how much did you got paid doing your job, and how many hours per week?  If you feel hesitation on revealing so, please write it up in clues form that are sensible (e.g. foreign currency amount, equivalent goods price, etc). I desperately need such info since I don't find any of these in Google.

As a side note, one company ever offered me such a position, 20 hrs/wk at Rp. 3-3,5 mio per month. Is it ok for me to ask Rp. 4,5 mio per month as a part time software engineer in the new contract? 

Thanks in Advance"
9a4jv0,1,2018-08-25,Lost my girlfriend due to my mental illness. I feel lost.,UnfoundHound,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9a4jv0/lost_my_girlfriend_due_to_my_mental_illness_i/,"About 3 months ago my girlfriend (19F) of 2 years and 3 months broke up with me (24M). She came to live with me in January 2018 after 2,5 years of a long distance relationship. Since then things went downhill. We barely saw each other due to our busy schedules (only in weekends), we didn't spend quality time together, we got into little fights because we were stressed, she wasn't comfortable at my home because my dad also lived with us and it just wasn't a place that felt like home, she made new friends in the city she works in but could hardly see them due to travel times, we had trouble finding a place for ourselves, among other things.

In March she already tried to break up with me when we got into a small fight. She was clearly upset. She said she didn't love me anymore, that she wants to 'feel love in different places', and that she wants to have a her/our own place. I begged her to stay and eventually she decided to stay.

In April I showed her more love and things went pretty well. However, at the end of the month and especially in May things turned for the worse again. We got back into the drag and the love and intimacy faded again. About halfway may she apparently had enough and searched for her own place in the city she works in without telling me. Two weeks later she had packed her stuff and told me she was leaving. Again she told me she didn't love me anymore and that she wanted to leave. She just didn't believe in me anymore, that I could make her happy and she didn't want to commit to me. I helped her move the next day and managed to convince her to take a break. This only lasted 3 days because I stupidly called her up in an emotional state. She got angry and then really broke up with me.

I was completely shocked both times when she wanted to break up with me. For me it came all out of nowhere. I managed to see her some days after the break up to talk about it. After having analyzed all that happened the past few months, I was convinced that it was just due to the stressful situation we were in. She told me that wasn't the case. She just said she doesn't love me anymore, that she doesn't believe I can make her happy, and that we do not fit in our core. I also told her that I made mistakes, but I was mostly putting the blame on the situation. We decided to stay friends. She still liked me and I suspect she still has feelings for me because she was very conflicted and emotional about breaking up with me. Perhaps those are just high hopes though.

Ever since the break-up, I have been a complete wreck. I cried and raged for days. I didn't eat and couldn't sleep. I got a break from my internship. I failed two exams. I felt incredibly depressed and even suicidal. I just wanted to end it. Occasionally, I felt motivated. I was desperately trying to look for ways to get her back. I contacted relationship experts and bought some of their products. I also talked to family and friends about it. Surprisingly, I managed to get a place of my own. My situation didn't get better though. I did have contact with my ex, but progress was slow. After a month or so I got professional help because it was all getting out of hand. A psychologist diagnosed me so far with having an acute depression. A friend of mine also suggested me a book about narcissism as he himself is a narcissist and recognized a lot of the traits in me.

Fast forward to now and my situation has still not improved. I still long for my ex. I love her deeply and even consider her the love of my life. I feel extremely depressed and suicidal. I also don't feel like I am somebody as if I'm an empty shell. I don't know what to do with my life anymore, I'm not motivated at all and I have constant panic attacks because I fear losing my ex forever, never getting her back. I am getting professional help, but it's a slow process. I was referred to a clinical psychologist who I had my intake with just yesterday. My next meeting is in two weeks.

Looking at myself and back at the last months of the relationship, I have the feeling that I'm mentally ill. I suspect that I either have a narcissistic personality disorder or a borderline personality disorder. It's hard to say though as I'm no professional, but there is clearly something wrong in my head. I was completely oblivious to all the signals my girlfriend gave me. I was not empathetic and I was even mean to her, pushing her away. Oddly enough, I love her deeply, more than anyone and anything, but for some reason I was not able to properly express that if I even did express it at all. I feel like there are two persons in my head: the one that feels, has dreams and ideas and wants to act on it vs. the one that is selfish, mean, negative and just keeps me from actually doing things. It feels like a constant battle in my head which is often own by the latter 'person'.

I suspect that many of my mental issues originate from my traumatic childhood. My parents divorced when I was 2, resulting in a long nast custody battle. I did not get to see my dad for 4 years because my mom had used me to get back at my dad by claiming he had sexually abused me which wasn't true. Eventually, when I was 6 my mom died of cancer. I was never able to love my mom after knowing she used me and I'm actually glad she is dead. Anyway, me and my two brothers then had to live with my dad, a man that was a stranger to me. Money was tight, my dad became an alcoholic, and he was constantly fighting with my oldest brother. This went on for years. All my dad's attention went towards my brothers and all he cared about with me were my school results. I got into a lot of trouble at school and with authorities in my youth. Ever since I was 12 I have felt depressed, never able to feel really happy. I was suicidal and self-harming. At 18 I even tried to commit suicide, but luckily failed. All my life I have felt alone and unsupported until I met the girl who is now my ex. It was such a great relationship. We loved each other so much and things went almost perfect, rarely having a fight. I could not have imagined a better relationship. I was really happy with her. Though sometimes I was still feeling down, unhappy or depressed; often when she and I were apart for some time. It's as if I was never able to be truly happy on my own and I didn't know why. During the long distance relationship (in which we did see each other every month for a week or two, in the summer for two months; so we spend a lot of time together) it wasn't so much a problem. My gf was aware of the problems I had, but was very supportive. Though in the last few months, since she came to live with me, I feel like I lost control and she couldn't deal with it anymore.

I feel hopeless now. I want my ex back so badly, knowing that I can make her happy, but it's like I lost her due to my mental problems without even knowing it. I don't know if I can ever get mentally healthy; if I she'll ever believe that it was because of mental issues and that she can forgive. I don't know I can ever get her back. I feel so scared and lost, and I could really use some help."
9a58n0,3,2018-08-25,Today’s my birthday and you’re not here,spicylilsamosa,UnsentLetters,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/9a58n0/todays_my_birthday_and_youre_not_here/,"P,

The big 21 I guess. Already I’ve received messages and congratulations but every single one of them is meaningless to me. I wonder if you know the pain I’ve gone through since the day you left. I wonder if you feel anything right now. I bet you do at least a little. I think some part of you might still love me. Or at least care about me. Some people are quick to call you a monster for the way you left. Honestly I’ve come to terms with why you did it- even if it was the worst way you could’ve done. You abandoned me when I needed you (and still need you) most. You left without even bothering to find out what happened during the worst week of my life. Funny thing was that I was waiting to tell you until you were done with your internship. I didn’t want to stress you with my troubles. I wish you knew.

I don’t want to do anything today. My friends are all dragging me out but I don’t want to go. Honestly I want to die. But I’ve been talking to a psychologist/therapist about everything and I’m trying to get better. I don’t want to feel this way. I’m trying to get better for myself. But I’m also trying to get better for you. The only thing I want is to talk to you. You robbed me of any possibility of being okay when you left. My world was already crumbling and you were the cherry on top that brought the rest of it crashing down. But I don’t even care. Because all I want is to know is that you’re okay. That you’re safe. I want to be there for you. And I wish you were here for me. But I care about you more.

The only thing I want for my birthday is you- although I know I won’t get so much as a text or call. I really do want to end it all. But what stops me is you. I don’t want to hurt you. I never have. And I’m okay with the end of us approaching but I’d hope for a proper conversation and closure rather than this death sentence you’ve placed upon me. So with that the only thing I really want is something from you. Words. Any words. Anything hurts less than the quiet. The anxiety I now have is built around the fear that we’ll never speak again.  The panic attacks ring in my ear screaming what I know you can’t hear. There’s so much I want to tell you, so much I want you hear, and so much I think you still want to say. I know it’ll take time before I ever get to speak to you. But it hurts more and more every single day. My grandma keeps telling me it’ll happen soon. She knows everything, and she thinks you’ll reach out soon. But that’s not the case despite her loving reassurance. I still think you’ll reach out eventually. You’re too kind not to- you have so much humanity. I’ve always loved that about you.

I imagined my birthday differently. All I wanted as to dance with you out of step. I wanted you to sing to me or with me during karaoke. I imagined you kissing me and whispering “happy birthday” in my ear before we drift off to sleep. Now I’m left with a gaping hole in my existence. One that consumes me 24/7. A pain in my heart and chest that never. goes. away. All I needed was a talk.

So tonight I’ll be swung around like a lifeless doll. I’ll sing a song for my friends and then slip back again. All I wanted was something from you. Even a hello would suffice. Or a simple “I’m okay.” But this pain eats away at me. 

If we never do talk, if someday the pain finally becomes too unbearable. Just know I died still loving you just as much as I do now- unboundedly. Always have, even now, and always will. Even just being allowed to speak once in a blue moon as friends would be enough for me to go on because I can’t stand the thought of never being able to see you accomplish all those beautiful things in life I know you will (even if I’m not at your side). But that’s what the psychologist/therapist and friends and family are for. To stop me from doing something. I don’t want to feel this way- I’m trying so hard to get better. Here’s to me actually making it to 21. I didn’t think I would a week ago. I just wish you were here. 

I love you.

Wonder why? Because we often the most important element or accessory, i.e. a piece of leather. Here are some smartest ways you can get your dream corporate look with good leather flap-overs manufacturer and quality leather bags &amp; wallets manufacturer brands.* 

&amp;#x200B;

Carrying a corporate look is a whole new genre. It is different from your everyday style, far from the party shimmers, and even very different what our previous generation used to wear at work. At this age, the corporate look all over the world follows the western pattern. So in an Indian scenario, it is not quite an easy task to look like your favourite Hollywood hero or the charming gal on the silver screen. Movies are enough for motivation but how would you really carry it in your day to day life? A little confidence, the right confidence and a great deal of leather assistance can bring success to this task! Let’s dig into the [**good leather flap-overs manufacturer** ](http://www.asianleather.com/)and quality leather bags &amp; wallets manufacturer brands

**The Devil Wears Leather**

Well I am not really sure whether it does or not, but what I know is, I was immensely influenced by the Meryl Streep, Anne Hathaway starrer film “The Devil Wears Prada”. The whole film is about an intern who lacks the high street fashion sense, yet, lands a job at a leading fashion magazine. In the course she learns how to carry fashionable looks at office, but loses her real self and her relationships. It was a fun film to watch and somehow it ends on a pleasant note, offering the viewers the message that it is always your choice how you want have a work life balance. Plus, I picked this from the movie, that though it is not essential but good to be fashionable at work. And when it’s work, leather is your first choice.

***“I like edgy but classic looks - like Chanel mixed with Alexander McQueen. My personal style is edgier. My closet is just black, gray, and white. I'm more comfortable in darker colors and leather jackets.”***

* ***Ashley Benson***

**Bag Your Style Girl**

What do generally wear at work? Shirts paired with trousers, kurti, sarees… no matter whatever you put along, get along with a product from the quality leather bags &amp; wallets manufacturer brands. Well, some do have a nose for the foreign brands, I love them, they are very much sophisticated beyond doubt. But nowadays, there are a lot of Indian companies as well who are experimenting with vibrant shades that go well with the Indian way of dressing. I mean, no matter how much we adore those holly babes in a black and white formal dressing, we love our colour infusion in everything. 

[Leather Handbag](https://i.redd.it/ahwuv7i977i11.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

**“*****A handbag is only one item to be worn with a complete outfit. Add a peony pink leather handbag to a charcoal gray suit, for instance, and the impact is chic with a touch of wit.”***

* ***Kate Spade***

Would you like a sport a pencil skirt at work? I know this is not a common practice amongst women, but if the circumstances are comfortable enough, I am sure, many of you would enjoy being in a skirt. Showing off the legs is smart enough!

**Flip Your Fashion to Leather Flap-overs**

Every person put his or her best effort to prove their worth at workplace, and men are no exception. They leave no stone unturned in making their seniors happy with their performance, staying late doing extra hours, inviting colleagues to lunch or other get togethers, yet, still find something is lacking. And what is that? The way you carry yourself. Remember, every man is different. You cannot look like Tom Cruise no matter how hard you try, you are the best of yourself. You don’t have to copy Mr. Cruise, and who can say, in a particular way you might look way killer than the Hollywood’s action hero. Mission possible with leather.

Add an extra edge to your everyday shirt-trouser combination. Carry a leather flap over bag. This will help you become and look much more organized. And when you look organized, you seem to be more dependable, sorted and trustworthy. Definitely, you don’t want to miss this. Look for good leather flap-overs manufacturer items online, you will come across several similar looking stuff. Make sure to read the reviews before freezing your pick. And voila! You are irresistible!

***- Heather Morris***

**What Else?**

Work is worship, they say, then why not take your worship attire a bit seriously? Now, I am not asking you become extravagant about it… rather, spend according to your budget of course. But when you look presentable, you appear more approachable. Try to wear pastel shade clothes at office, not too load. Monochrome is the ideal, though in India, it is not always possible, especially in case of ladies. The [**quality leather bags &amp; wallets manufacturer**](http://www.asianleather.com/) products go well with the corporate, pastel or monochrome look.

Wear a light perfume, not too light of course, and not very strong. Shoes must be ideally of leather, accompanied with a leather belt around the waist. Women can wear leather wristband watches, they are super classy and suit the traditional clothing style. "

* Hero Agency/Villain Team: None, but unlike my other OC’s she didn’t intern at Marvelous CD’s Hero Institute. She worked for a local NYC pro hero who’s quirk allows his hero agency to work on repairs around the city from villain attacks. Wholesome gal.
* Attitude: Determined to accomplish her goals. Very down-to-earth, sweet, and cares for the ones she loves.
* School: She went to ""Timely High School for the Exceptionally Quirked"" but was one of the 5 top marked first year students sent to U.A. for the inaugural 
* Year: First-year
* Department: Hero Course
* Class: Class 1-3A
* Distinguishing Physical Features: Besides tan year-round skin. Her hair is very long when she doesn’t have it in braids.
* Hero or Villain: Hero
* Hero/Villain Name: Terrafy
* Costume: As per usual I have no idea what would be cool as a costume.
* Gadgets/Tech/Weapons: **If anyone has a cool idea for this, comment for me**
* Name of their quirk: Terraforming
* Quirk Type: Emitter
* Quirk Range: Varies
* Quirk Description: Supreme control over the Earth and various forms of it. (Rocks, ground, mud, concrete, etc.)
* Miscellaneous Quirk Info: Think Earthbenders from Avatar and Terra from Teen Titans since I was watching those shows and liked the idea of and earth-controlling quirk. (Also didn't see it in the official list here yet lol)
* I would imagine she fights like a combination of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=664_7x0Z1eQ&amp;t=68s) and [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfGHf0HZ9PQ)
* Quirk Strengths: Very powerful both offensively and defensively.
* Quirk Weaknesses: Ironically she hates collateral damage, but has to destroy a lot of ground and buildings in cities to use her Quirk. Quirk is not nearly reliable in the air as she needs a connection with the earth she’s manipulating to use her quirk to the fullest potential. Also she’s no Magneto and can’t really do anything with metal.
* Special Moves: Not really much of a “special attack” but she can change mud to solid earth instantly.
* Combo Moves: Earthtastrophe (with Leo)- She uses her quirk to break the ground apart to form debris to go in conjunction with Alpha Grand Slam.
* Personal Strengths: She’s very determined and passionate to make a difference in the community one day. Very hard-working. 
* Personal Weaknesses: Doubting herself and not being confident in her power. Kinda shy sometimes.
* Age quirk obtained: 7
* How the quirk was obtained: She found out randomly at school
* Likes: Cooking
* Dislikes: Mornings
* Habits: Apologizing a lot
* Fears: She has a major fear of heights, coincidentally likes to stay on the ground.
* Reason for becoming a Hero/Villain: She had her apartment building destroyed in a villain attack as a kid. She’s really passionate about collateral damage, in the sense that she wants to help those who get caught in the cross fire of battles and have their property and homes destroyed. Wants to make an agency one day devoted to reconstruction.
* Relationship with peers/classmates: They all think well of her.
* Relationship with Family: She’s an only child so she’s really close with her family. They’re both quirkless so they try and support their daughter’s ambition however they can. They have an amazing restaurant too they all run!
* Relationship Status: Single, has a crush on Leo though but thinks he’s too popular and talent to like her back. (Classic.)
* Number of Kids: N/A
* Art (if any):
* Rating: Power: 4/5 Speed: 1/5 Technique: 4/5 Intelligence: 4/5 Cooperativeness: 5/5
* Miscellaneous Information: 
* Voice Actor: (Dub) I'd imagine she sounded like [Christy Carlson Romano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4weyLPhFDo_) from Kim Possible

9a7mm5,1,2018-08-25,[A4A] Literate Fandom Romance Roleplays,Coffeeandcatsrp,Roleplaykik,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplaykik/comments/9a7mm5/a4a_literate_fandom_romance_roleplays/,"Hey all! I am still on the hunt to do a literate fandom romance rp. Below are a few plot ideas, but I'm open to any you may have! (Note: These are Canon x OC, with you playing the canon role)

New Royal Crush (M x F or M x M)

Bowser x OC Bowser grew tired of chasing Princess Peach. He knew she didn't feel the same way he did. So he decided to pursue a new person...

This can be kidnapping, or maybe Bowser shows a sweet side. Up to you!

Not for Long (M x M)

Wallace Wells x OC (Scott Pilgrim Rp) When Scott brings over his new friend from work, Wallace outs on his usual moves. His best friend telling him the cute boy is straight won't stop him...

The Lab Intern (M x F or M x M) Professor Birch x OC (Pokemon) When Professor Birch was told he would get a new intern, he wasn't expecting someone so cute. As his feelings grow by the day, what will he do?

SHE/HE'S MINE! (M x F or M x M) BTR guys x OC (Big Time Rush) After a new up and coming artist moves into the Palm Woods, the guys go crazy for them (except for Kendall). Who will this new artist choose?

This is a love rivalry plot.

New to the Force (M x M) The Ginyu Force x OC (Dragon Ball Z) After Guildo left, the Ginyu force hired a new member- but weren't expecting someone so adorable and begin fighting over him. What will he do?

This is a love rivalry plot.

Game on, dude! (M x F or M x M) Bastion, Chumley and Hassleberry x OC (Yugioh GX) After a new student moved to Duel Academy, the guys couldn't resist them. Who will the newbie go for?

I will play pretty much all other characters in this, and it's a love rivalry.

Colors (M x M) Beast Boy x OC (Teen Titans) Beast Boy never thought he would love again. Until a cute boy joined their team... Wait, did he like guys? How will he deal with his feelings as they grow stronger?

Moving on (M x F or M x M) Tom x OC (Star vs the forces of evil After getting dumped by Star for Marco, Tom never thought he'd love again... Until someone new comes into his sights...

If none of these strike your fancy, feel free to give me your ideas/fandoms! Other fandoms I enjoy but don't have a specific plot for: Adventure Time, Avatar the last airbender, Disney, Inuyasha, Left 4 Dead, Legend of Korra, Total Drama

⭐⭐ Here are my rules:

1. Please be literate. No text talk or bad grammar (minus the occasional slip up of course).

2. I only rp in 3rd person. This is non-negotiable. Please be okay doing 3rd.

3. I ONLY PLAY UKE/SUB, NEVER DOM!!!! MY CHARACTERS ARE SUBS ONLY!!!! You have been warned!!!!

4. Be okay with OC x canon

5. Please be an active role player overall. We all have lives but please don't just disappear for days on end and never return.

6. If you are looking for all smut, you have come to the wrong place. I am fine with a build up to smut, but I want there to be a focus on romance and plot.

7. Please be respectful of me. I am a very friendly person but the quickest way to end an rp with me is to treat me badly. I am a human that deserves dignity like everyone else. Insult me once and it's over.

8. I'm sorry, but if your profile pic has a real person in it, I would ask that you change it before rping. It really just throws me off as weird as that sounds (anime/cartoon pics, scenery and anything else really are fine).

9. I usually do written bios, but if you HAVE to have pictures, I only do anime/cartoon refs and will only accept the same. NO REAL LIFE PICS PLEASE!!!

I am fine with people of all gender expressions, as long as you play M! My timezone is EST US time. All characters will be 18+. I am working most of today but I will reply as soon as possible. 

I think that's it? If interested, kik:

Hope to rp soon!

9a9egy,11,2018-08-25,“The Faceless One is my father.”,ASavageLost,u_ASavageLost,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ASavageLost/comments/9a9egy/the_faceless_one_is_my_father/,"Back at the spot Rufus and I laid out our cardboard mats to sleep on. Once we settled, the atmosphere of a family living room came over the place. There were always other homeless junkies who slept under the overhang with us on nights it rained. We laughed and joked or smoked joints. Rarely drugs were shared. I was waiting for the right time to break what Jimbo had told me about Ally to Rufus.

“So……” I let the word hang and waited for him to ask what I was thinking about. It made me feel better about the news I was about to break if he asked me for it.

“So, what?” He knelt facing me with a straight back.

“So, I saw Jimbo the other day.”

“Yeah? Isn’t that where you said you got that bag of premium?”

“Yup.”

“What’d he say?”

“Some things. You know he talks a lot.”

“Sure does. Don’t really know him, but I know how long it takes you to get in and out of there when yall got business or what have you.”

“He talked to me about Ally.”

“Ally? Like my Ally? Ally Alcoholic, Ally?”

“Yes.”

“Hmmm…. What’d he say about her?”

“He said..” I paused and searched his face. He looked curious but also troubled by something from his past in his eyes. “Jimbo said the Faceless One has given him direct orders that you’re not supposed to see her or talk to her anymore.”

“I see.” He nodded like it was just what he expected me to say. I was confused.

“You see?”

“Yeah.”

“What does the Faceless One even know about you? What does he know about Ally?”

“It’s time I told you.” He shook his head. He wasn’t happy about it.

“Told me what?”

“Told you everything.”

He lit two cigarettes. Kept one drawing in smoke and making the cherry glow red. The other one he passed to me, and I pulled the smoke into my lungs getting myself ready to listen to the story. Rufus had his hood on. His eyes looked hollow, his face drawn and grey. He began to spin the yarn.

“The Faceless One is my father.”

“WHAT?”

“Yes. He’s my father.”

“How?”

“Well, let me tell you. Stop interrupting.” I got quiet. “You see, I never told you that my mother was young when she had me. She was barely 18. It was the 80s. She told me once how she’d run away from home because things were just so bad there. My mother, Boom Boom, my mother was as beautiful a woman as I have ever laid eyes on in my entire life! She did the best she could for me. I’ll always love her for it. We lived in a crummy hotel room where my father, the man everyone called Joseph Junior, would come to visit her. So when he came he always brought me a new toy, a new remote-control car or skateboard or whatever you know, so I’d go out on the street or in the hallway while he slept with her. She loved him. She told me so and made sure I knew he was my father. He came like once a month or something. I just remember his tattoos and mustache. Other nights though, she’d leave me in the room for hours while she walked the streets and turned tricks in cars. I was five! Five years old!” He held his hand up with all five fingers splayed and tapped himself in the head with his other hand. “Can you believe that? You know, I didn’t realize that at the time, but now I do. Seen it all so much myself, it’s hard to think back on. Never wanted to tell you all this, Boom Boom.”

“No. I’m glad you are.”

“Yeah?”

“Yeah. I think it’s good to get out. And I wanna know anyway.”

“Sure.” He nodded. “I was probably eight years old when that whole thing that happened with the Jones girl went down.”

“Jones girl?”

“The one who got killed. Junior had her all strung out on heroin and turned out in a bad way. My mother helped take care of her some. She was always bringing her back to sleep in our room with us. The girl was too bad off. I remember the night my mother found out she’d been murdered. Even more than that I remember the night she heard about the girl’s father throwing that acid in Junior’s face. He was in the hospital for almost two years. No one knew if he’d live. I never prayed, but on that one I prayed.”

“You did?”

“Yeah. I think everyone did. Everyone except my mom and Natalia. Once, before it happened, you know, he took us out on a walk, me and my mom. We went to the top of his building where they had this balcony and he grabbed me up and held me over the ledge. I was crying. My mother was screaming. He was just laughing and getting his kicks on seeing me so terrified. I peed my pants. That’s just how he was though, crazy, but he always had this sway over women. My mom. The Jones girl. He controlled their minds or something, for real.”

I looked at Rufus. His face was even paler and more drawn than before. I took one last puff of my cigarette and flicked it towards the street.

“Had my mom and Natalia the worst of ‘em all.”

“Wait, I thought your wife left you for your dad?”

“You remember that?”

“Yeah.”

“She did. Sorta. You know the whole question about what all happened during his surgeries, right? Like some people say he sold his soul to Satan in exchange for a few more years?”

“Yeah. I’ve heard that.”

“Well, it’s true. Or something like it. I’m not sure what, but when he came out of those surgeries alive, I could feel it. There was some black spirit residing within his body. Somehow, I knew that, but I also knew that that it couldn’t touch me no matter how badly it wanted to devour me. He started by killing my mother. I think Natalia did it. After school in 8th grade, I came home, and the police had the room all taped off. There was blood all over the floor. I saw it, before they carried me away screaming and crying and punching myself for letting it happen.”

“You didn’t let that happen though, Roof. You were just a kid.”

“I was a kid, but she was my mother. She was my mother.” He wiped his face and sniffled. “She was my mother.”

I didn’t know what to say. There were no words to speak. I looked at my shoes. A long time passed of us not looking at each other. Finally, he lit another cigarette and collected himself enough to speak on the facts of it again. There was an emotional detachment in his voice I had never heard him speak with before. He stared out at the dark wet playground across the street. It was drizzling again.

“Natalia did his bidding. Everyone knew that, but instead of just collecting money from the girls or managing his affairs like before, she started killing for him. She likes to use broken bottles or antique knives, stuff like that, to stab them and lets them bleed out sort of like her signature. I think the murders are sacrifices. There’s all kinds of weird rules with it, you know, the thing living inside of him. It won’t let him touch me. Like they say, it’s not Joseph Junior in there anymore. Just the Faceless One.”

I stayed quiet. There was no reason to mention the fact that I’d done work for Jimbo. Almost always contracts given to him directly by Natalia and the Faceless One before her. Rufus knew there was some affiliation but kept himself out of the details. He didn’t know. He didn’t want to.

“You never told me about your wife.” I said.

“Oh yeah. You can’t guess who she is?”

“Who she is? What do you mean?”

“What’s this all about, Boom Boom? Huh? Who is it this whole conversation got started over?” Rufus curled the left side of his lip. He pointed his brow at me.

“Ally?”

“Yes. Ally Alcoholic. My Ally. Very good, Boom Boom.”

It all made sense. Well, some of it did. There were still a lot of questions, questions that didn’t seem to have answers.

“Like I said, the Faceless One can only mess with people I love or care about. One day, whatever goes on in the spirit world will change. He’ll get Natalia to do enough sacrifices. He’ll collect enough body parts and say the right incantations to get the greenlight on taking my life, but for now, he plagues those I love. After my mother died, they put me in a boys’ home up state. I graduated and received that scholarship for college and med school. My internship was here, so I came and met her. The rest of it’s like I told you. We fell in love. Got married. Had a kid. That part I left out, because it hurts worse than my mother.”

“Why?”

He shook his head. His lip quivered. “She died of leukemia.”

“I’m so sorry.”

It took him another few minutes to collect himself. He swallowed and spoke again.

“Soon as the pregnancy started, I felt it. I knew it was him and Natalia doing their magic. Ally got sick. Started bleeding and fainting out of nowhere. The girl, though.” He smiled a bit. “The girl was born. Her name was Clementine. Classic name, you know? Ally had to do psychological evaluations and the state monitored her. They let her come home with Clementine, but it wasn’t a happy time for us, Boom Boom. Our baby girl died in less than five years. Ally never recovered. Something inside of her, that magic and power he had even when he was just still Joseph Junior called her to him. She disappeared for a week, and when she came back, she told me the worst things she could. She told me she loved him. She told me that they’d made love.” Rufus slowed the story down. He blew air through his nostrils and laughed. He fell over. “All I could think about was how disgusting it would have looked. Her crazy and dark around the eyes. Him looking like the elephant man.” He laughed and laughed and then he bawled hard.

Some of the other homeless sleeping around us woke up and complained about the noise. They told us to go to sleep. Rufus never finished the story, but I think I had the idea. Eventually, whatever the Faceless One had to do with Ally was done, but some sort of juju wouldn’t allow him to kill her. She was all used up and damaged. So, now she sat on her bench, out of her mind, a decrepit liquor hound. Rufus still came to see her and check on her. After all of it, he still loved Ally. She was the mother of his only child. He blamed himself for all that had happened anyway. Not her."
9a9m7y,85,2018-08-25,Analysis &amp; Predictions for Rounds 1-5,Whitebearbepo,BokuNoHeroAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/9a9m7y/analysis_predictions_for_rounds_15/,"[Please refer to this image of 1-A vs 1-B match-up so this post is easier to follow.](https://i.imgur.com/zakgOx8.png) I have 2 versions/predictions. [Vote who wins here](https://linkto.run/p/E07M8TBV)

**Preface**: I have 2 predictions I strongly believe in. Other than those guesses, everything else that Kohei does differently is not problematic (besides skipping fights). I think there will be a definitive winner, but Kohei can have them tie 2-2-1. The tie can only occur during Round 2-4. Kohei hasn't revealed the final recommended student and I surmise that they're no 2 recommended students in the same team (Momo and Todo are separated). It could be Kuroiro (Quirk: Black) or Reiko (Quirk: Poltergeist). I also find it hard to believe that any team is be able to slam 4 people into prison because that seems really hard to do. **1-A has higher highs but lower lows while 1-B is seemingly consistent and steady throughout.**

* 1. There **won't** be a 3-0 sweep or a 3-1 lead. The 3rd victory will be achieved in Round 5.
* 2. Shinso **won't** win or lose twice. He'll win one round and lose the other. If he wins or loses twice, it's *almost* a guarantee acceptance or denial into the Heroics Course. Being 1-1 adds more drama to the decision.

---
**Round 1**: 

**v1**: 1-A's winning condition is Shinso and Kaminari. However, Shinso may be higher priority. Shinso pulling out his new skills (Persona Code or Binding Cloth Techniques) may be so shocking that it stuns 1-b into defeat. Kaminari has strong offense, so if he sharp shoot 1-B, they're set to go.

**v2**: 1-B's winning condition is Ibara. She can easily neutralize Kaminari's electricity and she has range. If she restrains 1-A with her vines, none of them can get out of it with pure strength (maybe Koda can). Tsuburaba's solid air may also be able to defend against electricity.

**Interesting Interactions (IntInt)**: Kirishima's main opponent is the Chinese transfer student, Hiryu Rin (Quirk: Scales). They both have skin augmentation and are both close quarter combat (CQC) fighters. Hiryu may have Chinese martial arts that are superior to Kirishima's fist fighting, but it'll prove useless if he can't damage him. I wonder if Koda can semi-mind-tap Shishida since he's becoming more beastly than human. Koda's quirk might make Shishida hesitant.

---
**Round 2**: 1-B WINS

**1-A**: First impressions is that 1-A will win because when we see Tokoyami (who's fresh off Hawk's internship), we think of a sturdy, flexible, and powerful fighter. Couple that with Momo's intelligence and versatility, and we have a strong duo. The problem comes in with Hagakure and Aoyama who are essentially liabilities. Hagakure can sneak around, but she has no restraining devices. With her light refraction and Aoyama's laser beams, it'll cause trouble for Dark Shadow. 

**1-B**: Look at their CLEAN team pose, they are definitely rocking GOD tier communication skills. Kuroiro's quirk seems to only make his skin black, but if that's it...then he must be strong on a fundamental level to make it through the entrance exam. Kendo can give Dark Shadow a run for his money with enhanced hands coupled with her *karate techniques*. Kinoko reminds me of those pesky grass-type crowd control (CC) Pokemon with poison, sleep, paralysis, etc. Also, Manga Fukidashi is *OBJECTIVELY* the strongest 1st year student. He's essentially a meta reality-breaker. ~~*He could draw in MHA artwork of him beating his opponents thus making it canon to the story.*~~

**IntInt**: Kuroiro's quirk may have some AoE darkness element which may inadvertently enhance Dark Shadow. Hagakure and Manga seem to be the the class equivalent to each other, so they may have some funny interactions.

---
**Round 3**: 1-A WINS

**1-A**: They have Shoto who can hard carry. I'm excited to see him showcase any new abilities since we didn't even see them in the Provisional License Exam (PLE). They have reconnaissance with Shoji and Iida's recipro-burst for throwing them into prison. I'd be surprised the most if 1-A lost.

**1-B**: 3/4 of them actually have quirks that can deal with Shoto's ice restraints. TetsuTetsu can smash the ice, Honenuki can softening the ice to escape, and Sen Kaibara can ""gyrate/spin drill"" his way out of the ice. Honenuki's softening quirk to sink his opponents is a strong restraining quirk.

**IntInt**: Ojiro's main opponent will be TetsuTestu because he trained his tail by smacking it againsted a hardened Kirishima ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°). Pony's and Iida's mobility may be compared during the fight.

---
**Round 4**: 

**v1**: 1-A **LOSES** even though they have Bakugo who is a combat genius. Bakustans...don't get mad at me, I have a good reason. Bakugo is strong, but his cooperation skills may be so off-putting that it crumbles the synergy of the team which 1-B can take advantage of. Bakugo may take out a few, but 1-B can play it smart by running the clock out when they have the number advantage. 

**v2**: 1-A **WINS** if Bakugo's cooperation skills are decent. He's showcased this during the cavalry battle and the PLE, but Sero is the only person he's familiar with. I think 1-B has the weakest composition/students for Round 4. Jiro can sound wave the enemies to stun them (Bakugo's stun grenade too) while Sero restrains them. 

**IntInt**: If Tokage (Quirk: Lizard Tail Cut) gets caught by Sero, she can probably dismember her limbs to escape and she can regenerate it. Awase can restrain people by welding people to objects or himself. He can be a formidable CQC fighter.

---
**Round 5**: The last man standing is probably Shinso and Deku to determine the winners

**v1**: 1-A wins through Deku's strengths and strategy. Mineta's CC abilities will play a key role in restraining 1-B. With v1, Shinso wins Round 1, but he may have already shown all his tricks to which 1-A can learn from. Shinso may brainwash Deku, but he relives the OFA experience of breaking out.

**v2**: 1-B wins through Monoma's cunning plans and trickery and the narrative payback win for Shinso. If Reiko turns out to be a recommended student, then that bolsters 1-B. She may have a ghost familiar similar to Dark Shadow. Imagine Monoma coping Shinso's quirk and annoying 1-A so much that they respond. 1-A has no way of knowing which quirk Monoma has currently activated. 

**IntInt**: Shinso may copy female voices to seduce and restrain Mineta. Monoma in general b/c of the vast amount of combinations at play.

Unfortunately for me, that's about to change.

I stride through the office, my tight pencil skirt showing off my ass and stocking clad legs, my tight blazer hugging the curves of my breasts, a small triangle of my thin, cream coloured blouse visible at the top. My shoulder length blonde hair is bound tightly behind my head, not a wisp out of place, and my tall black heels click menacingly on the faux wood floor.

I see people hunker down, doing their best to look busy as I pass, and smile to myself. I enjoy having power over the people who work under me, and I never hesitate to exploit it. I pause at the door to my large office, turning on my heel and clearing my throat loudly.

""As you all know, we'll be holding annual performance reviews this week. I'll call you to my office when it's your turn""

I can almost feel the mood in the office grow tenser, any hints of a smile quickly wiping themselves off their respective faces. My own smile widens as I turn back to enter my office, snapping my fingers at me secretary to bring me coffee and checking my schedule briefly - a new group of interns was arriving later that day.

___________________________________________________

Put my in my place. Make me your bitch.

Who you are is up to you - one of my employees, fed up with the ridiculous standards I construct for the annual review? My secretary, tired of being thrown the most menial tasks? A young intern who I try to seduce using my position as leverage only to have the tables turned on me?

Or maybe you're not from the office at all - you could be the head of a larger company, looking to take over another smaller one - and add another slut to her harem. Or a reporter who turns up dirt on the company and uses it to blackmail me. Or anybody else you want to be! Feel free to combine or modify any of my ideas as well!

My ultimate fate is up to you - will I be your personal slave, obeying your every command without question? Or maybe the company slut - spreading my legs to help you close business deals. Maybe you'll just slip a collar on me and keep me chained in the corner of the office as I watch you become more successful than I ever was.

As you can probably tell, I love having control taken from me, or being seduced into giving it up willingly. I also enjoy being shown off and humiliated in public settings and verbally abused.

Bondage, foot worship, petplay, and forced tattooing/piercing/branding are all things I'd be interested in including, but definitely optional if they're not up your alley or don't work with what you want to do. Futa is okay.

Not a huge fan of toilet play, but most other things are very welcome, so feel free to slip in any fetishes you like!

I experienced the severest shame and depression in dealing with the horrors of psychosis to the point where I was hospitalized for suicidality. My life changed in the hospital once my medication was adjusted and I felt all the love and support from my family and girlfriend.
Since then I have rebuilt my life immensely, and your book 12 Rules for Life has played no small part in that. I am at a four year college having earned my associate’s degree. I am majoring in psychology and minoring in criminal justice. I want to be an advocate for those who struggle with mental illness and hopefully provide insight if I can. I also have an internship in a social psychology and neuroscience lab to study aggression.
I also have begun writing and sharing my experiences with my illness and have gotten amazing responses. I have been extremely influenced by your fantastic writing and hope to give a voice to the downtrodden as you do.
My greatest achievement has been proposing to my best friend, and getting an apartment with her and living my life to the fullest and realizing my potential.
Thank you for being one of the most influential and major voices of encouragement in society today.  You have surely inspired me and your talks and writings have moved me to take responsibility and shoulder all the problems of life that I can. Thank you for telling me I am capable.

I \[24\] met girl D (my now ex)\[21\] and her best friend about 4 years ago at a gaming tournament in our small town, while I was there with a good friend of mine. In the course of a year a lot of drama happen because I liked her, she liked my friend (who did not like her) and her best friend liked me. So in the end the we all fell out apart from me and girl D. Her best friend put an ultimatum on her but in the end she chose me and her happiness over her best friend. So we started dating.

Unfortunately, since I am 3 years older than her I was in my second year of studying in the UK and she was in 12th grade, so we were long distance. Everything was lovely, nevertheless. We could hang out for 6+ hours a day over Skype without getting bored of each other. I made sure to visit whenever I could.

1 year later when she graduated she also came to the UK but in a town 3 hours away. I visited her often and I made sure to help out however I could, either financially or giving my time and helping her with homework, or just life in general. On many occasions her parents had thanked me for taking good care of their daughter and I’d like to think I had a good reputation with them.

After this another year passed by and I was in my final year of university, so I was very busy with deadlines and getting my dissertation done. Furthermore, I was looking for a grad job in her city, because I wanted to move in with her. We were both very excited for this. During the winter holidays I decided not to go home to my family but stay here with her so she wouldn’t feel lonely. But it was during this time that things started to go south. When we met we had a conversation where she told me that for a while now she hasn’t felt the same towards me, and though we should end our relationship. I thought the reasons she outlined were very strange and not characteristic of her. Things such as me not being motivated enough (yet I finished with a First degree and had an internship at a 4th largest company in the world), how she liked when I used to go to the gym but now had stopped (this was because of my 4th year deadlines) and other things about how she thought I had really good hair but would wish I would try more hairstyles with it. Basically all of this came out of nowhere and I was very confused.

Nevertheless, I decided to respect her feelings and said I accept her decision. However, the day when she was going to leave she broke down and started crying, asking me if I could come with her to her city. So I agreed. When we were over there, we actually spent a great time together, cleared up a lot of things. On the last day we said goodbye to each other with a hug and a kiss. As you can imagine I thought everything was going well. Little did I know that would be out last.

A week later she wrote me a letter and after a brief 20min phone called she said that her decision was final for us to break up. The letter outlined the reason as a “mismatch in our communication”. Even though she had written things like, “you’ve always given me everything I ever wanted in a relationship” and that “the last couple of months were the best we’ve had”. She mention she had no problem with our friendship and valued me greatly as a friend and would like to remain close.

I agreed because I decided it was probably for the best not to be a couple, but I couldn't imagine not talking to someone with whom we had been practically best friends for the past 3 years. The only thing I wanted from her was to once and for all meet in person and close the whole relationship topic, since there were still many question left unanswered.

We met a while back at a neutral location, and spend the whole day together. We had a great time. We talked quite a bit and at the time what she was saying seemed to make sense, but when I went home, the more I thought about it the more I saw gaps. She mentioned things such as that she needed to love herself and that she thought she was always sacrificing herself for others, that she felt like she required too much of my attentions and that wasn't fair, she also apologised for some of the things she had said and done during our last months. When I asked her what the problem with out relationship was, she said she didn't think there was one. In the end the only valid reason I heard from her was about my religion, since I am a protestant and go to church regularly. Now she is a christian as well, eastern orthodox, but I have never tried to push my beliefs on her. She also said that she has no problem with me being a protestant and doesn't want to change me. So I can't understand where the problem is.

After that meeting we actually started talking a bit more from time to time. One night, after we hadn't spoken for weeks she messaged me to see how I was and told me she had been thinking about me these past days. We ended up talking on Skype just like old times, for hours. She said some things that night, that made me feel uneasy again. Things such as that she's now starting to appreciate all the help I had provided her with. Saying that she's changed and learned a lot. She even said something about not deserving me and that she missed me. In the end she said she wanted to “restore the communication/relationships between us”. I'm still not sure what exactly she meant by this since she didn't say to get back together as a couple. Throughout this whole conversation decided to go along with her and told her I don't think we should rush but that I was ok with us “restoring the communication”. I felt that this wasn't the time to talk about how deeply she had hurt me and how the trust between us is forever scarred. I knew she would be visiting home in a month's time for her birthday and decided to wait till then to talk. Nevertheless we started speaking more often.

Unfortunately in the meantime all the old feelings started coming back… She's back in town now and she suggested we go out sometime. So I intend to talk to her in the coming days. I'm not sure how she feel about me, but for me it's starting to be hard to be just a friend. It seems all or nothing at this point.

Based on what I've told you about this person, what could be the reason for her to end our relationship? And does this seem like a person that could be trusted again?

tl;dr - Met an amazing girl, spend wonderful 3 year together with her. She suddenly ended the relationship with no apparent reason and now months later she is started to get close to me again."
9aapq1,6,2018-08-25,30 years old and still hitting myself,IAmUngit,StopSelfHarm,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSelfHarm/comments/9aapq1/30_years_old_and_still_hitting_myself/,"Hello. I don't remember when I started hurting myself. It was sometime before I was ten because it started before we moved out of my first house. My mom got really sick and emotionally unstable, and I didn't understand what was happening and somehow put blame on myself, especially when she had emotional outbursts when my sister and I misbehaved. It started with me slamming my head against the wall in my room and developed into punching myself. 

Fast forward a little over 20 years. I am now 30 years old, married, and have two kids. About three years ago I felt compelled to go back to school and started seminary. I've been in school 3 years and just started my internship year, which is called a vicarage, and for the past several years I've been struggling with hitting myself again. 

My wife know about my self-abuse, but I don't tell her about it when it happens, because it is often triggered when she rips into me for stuff, usually for little things that seem a lot bigger to her in the moment. I've talked to her about the way she talks to me and how it can be really demeaning and she always comes back later and apologizes, because she knows she was being hurtful. 

I really don't want to bring this to my wife because I don't want her to feel guilty or like she can't come to me with her frustrations and concerns. 

I would have gone to talk with my pastor about this, but right now my pastor is also my internship supervisor, and I don't want to sound like I am trying to get out of work or make him feel like he needs to walk on eggshells around me. 

But today I went into the bathroom (I never let my kids see this part of me) and gave my self a beating. Afterward I've been feeling so isolated and alone, because I don't feel like I have anyone to turn to when I get overwhelmed by that feeling of self-revulsion, like I want the walls to collapse in and crush me, partly out of punishment and partly out of a desire for escape. That's why I am posting this. I just hated the idea that I couldn't tell someone about it.

I think part of what's going on is that I feel a bit trapped in my seminary program. I never really wanted to become a pastor (my father is a pastor, so I should have known better), but now I feel so invested in it, and I don't know what else I would do if I stopped. There are some aspects to it that are great, but overall, it's a very demanding job with a lot of stress attached, and it can be very difficult to balance work life with family life. 

Anyway, thanks for putting up with me as I rant/confess my crap to you. If anyone has any advice, I'd like to hear it. Do you think I should be more open about this with my wife? Should I be going to therapy or something? I don't know. All i know is that I've hit myself twice already this week and I am worried about the rest of this internship year."

Even though I am deadset in being a finance and math major I am also interested in learning as much as I can about CS. So far I have only taken CSE 110 and CSE 205.I know that a few math majors at ASU have gotten CS internships and job opportunities since you dont have to necessarily be a CS major for these jobs. My question to the math majors that are also interested in CS what did you guys do to get said opportunities? What MAT or CS classes did you take, what clubs did you join, what programming languages did you learn,who did you reach out to,etc.? 

I know this is a lot but I want to make the best of my college career and any input is greatly appreciated. Thank you."
9abbj5,4,2018-08-25,Beginner looking for guidance,Rich-douchebag,Meditation,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/9abbj5/beginner_looking_for_guidance/,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I believe I want to start meditating. I read the FAQ, and here's a general outline of myself and my goals with this:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Outline of myself\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

First, myself. I'm a second year finance student in the US. I go to a very rigorous school, and I am also attempting to double major in Economics along with Business. Needless to say, it is a lot of work and a lot of stress. On that same page, because I am attempting to get an internship in some of the most competitive positions in finance (investment banking, private equity), I am also constantly recruiting, networking, prepping for interviews, and in general working on myself to be a good candidate for these jobs. That is, of course, even more stress. I a in a frat and a finance club, which also take up time (although the fun I have with my frat is relaxing and good for me, I believe). 

&amp;#x200B;

More personally, I occasionally have self-confidence issues which mostly stem from how I view my own appearance. I am going to the gym much more frequently which helps a lot with that, but worry that I'll struggle to maintain a consistent schedule. Some of these issues are exacerbated by the fact that I just (mutually) broke up with my girlfriend because, long story short, we go to different schools and long-distance really isn't appealing. Again, this adds more stress.

&amp;#x200B;

I can become very emotionally strained and antisocial/""lightly"" depressed (I really don't know any better way to describe this) for a day or two when some combination of stress, self-appearance, or emotional pain hit me at a vulnerable time. I would, of course, like to avoid these events.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*My goals\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Although I do believe I can usually handle stress very well, I think it would help to use some techniques I learn through meditation. Along with general stress management, here's a list of things I hope to accomplish through meditation:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Stress management - Although I do believe I can usually handle stress very well, I think I could still use some help here.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Focus - especially when studying, sometimes I struggle to hunker down and get my work down without distracting myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

3. Confidence/Emotional stability - I think I made it clear why this is something I want. 

&amp;#x200B;

4. Sleep - When I have a lot on my mind, I struggle to fall asleep. This sucks, because sleep is very important to my well-being. My best description of it is a whirlwind of things I worry about - whether it be school, recruiting, other things I have to do, or whatever else - keep popping into my mind, and I cannot relax (seemingly) until I plan out how to deal with all of these issues. This is good because it actually does help my clarify my priorities and what I need to do, but at the same time, it is important to me to get to sleep when I need to get to sleep. So this is kinda two pronged: I want to be able to fall asleep easier/quicker, and do this kind of planning during meditation instead. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would greatly appreciate input on where to start with meditation, techniques/etc, and other comments you may have on what I can do. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'd be happy to answer any other questions you might have. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for your help."

9ac9b3,2,2018-08-25,[A4A] Literate Fandom Romance Plots,Coffeeandcatsrp,Roleplaykik,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplaykik/comments/9ac9b3/a4a_literate_fandom_romance_plots/,"Hey all! I am still on the hunt to do a literate fandom romance rp. Below are a few plot ideas, but I'm open to any you may have! (Note: These are Canon x OC, with you playing the canon role)

New Royal Crush (M x F or M x M)

Bowser x OC Bowser grew tired of chasing Princess Peach. He knew she didn't feel the same way he did. So he decided to pursue a new person...

This can be kidnapping, or maybe Bowser shows a sweet side. Up to you!

Not for Long (M x M)

Wallace Wells x OC (Scott Pilgrim Rp) When Scott brings over his new friend from work, Wallace outs on his usual moves. His best friend telling him the cute boy is straight won't stop him...

The Lab Intern (M x F or M x M) Professor Birch x OC (Pokemon) When Professor Birch was told he would get a new intern, he wasn't expecting someone so cute. As his feelings grow by the day, what will he do?

SHE/HE'S MINE! (M x F or M x M) BTR guys x OC (Big Time Rush) After a new up and coming artist moves into the Palm Woods, the guys go crazy for them (except for Kendall). Who will this new artist choose?

This is a love rivalry plot.

New to the Force (M x M) The Ginyu Force x OC (Dragon Ball Z) After Guildo left, the Ginyu force hired a new member- but weren't expecting someone so adorable and begin fighting over him. What will he do?

This is a love rivalry plot.

Game on, dude! (M x F or M x M) Bastion, Chumley and Hassleberry x OC (Yugioh GX) After a new student moved to Duel Academy, the guys couldn't resist them. Who will the newbie go for?

I will play pretty much all other characters in this, and it's a love rivalry.

Colors (M x M) Beast Boy x OC (Teen Titans) Beast Boy never thought he would love again. Until a cute boy joined their team... Wait, did he like guys? How will he deal with his feelings as they grow stronger?

Moving on (M x F or M x M) Tom x OC (Star vs the forces of evil After getting dumped by Star for Marco, Tom never thought he'd love again... Until someone new comes into his sights...

If none of these strike your fancy, feel free to give me your ideas/fandoms! Other fandoms I enjoy but don't have a specific plot for: Adventure Time, Avatar the last airbender, Disney, Inuyasha, Left 4 Dead, Legend of Korra, Total Drama

⭐⭐ Here are my rules:

1. Please be literate. No text talk or bad grammar (minus the occasional slip up of course).

2. I only rp in 3rd person. This is non-negotiable. Please be okay doing 3rd.

3. I ONLY PLAY UKE/SUB, NEVER DOM!!!! MY CHARACTERS ARE SUBS ONLY!!!! You have been warned!!!!

4. Be okay with OC x canon

5. Please be an active role player overall. We all have lives but please don't just disappear for days on end and never return.

6. If you are looking for all smut, you have come to the wrong place. I am fine with a build up to smut, but I want there to be a focus on romance and plot.

7. Please be respectful of me. I am a very friendly person but the quickest way to end an rp with me is to treat me badly. I am a human that deserves dignity like everyone else. Insult me once and it's over.

8. I'm sorry, but if your profile pic has a real person in it, I would ask that you change it before rping. It really just throws me off as weird as that sounds (anime/cartoon pics, scenery and anything else really are fine).

9. I usually do written bios, but if you HAVE to have pictures, I only do anime/cartoon refs and will only accept the same. NO REAL LIFE PICS PLEASE!!!

I am fine with people of all gender expressions, as long as you play M! My timezone is EST US time. All characters will be 18+. I am working most of today but I will reply as soon as possible.

I think that's it? If interested, kik:

Hope to rp soon!

Update:
Thank you everyone for your info. A little more backstory I’m a college student with not a huge budget. So I might attempt using ad words with a small budget to help kickoff my site. My current platform is to help me peers get internships. Being a computer programmer my degree isn’t the most social and going to fairs can be rough for my friends. I’m trying to fix that.

(Hi!   21 M bi here. Looking for anyone wanting to play, girls and guys welcome. Prefer someone playing a character older then mine. If you want you can play a couple too. I prefer the story to evolve into sex, romance and some social play, but   your take on it is fine too. Leave a name, description of your character,  any  kinks you want included and continue from the prompt in a pm to me  if  you want to play =) And feel free to message even if this post is  old.)

Three weeks ago we met for the  first time when I was lost downtown in this, for me, new country. My name is Kim, I'm 19 years old, from Sweden, and have just moved here for an  internship working with care of the elderly at a gated community outside town. We instantly got along really well and have been hanging  out a lot ever since. With my bright blonde hair,  short and petite form  you can't help but find me really cute. I'm only  about 160 cms tall  with a fit lithe body from good (?) genetics and a lot of running. My pale skin doesnt handle the sun very well so I'm often sunburnt and have plenty of summer freckles. You  know I'm quite nerdy and enjoy playing videogames  and tabletop RPGs on  my spare time.

We're not dating but when  we meet there's usually a lot of flirting  going on. I'm usually happy and energetic but easily get flustered and shy when you turn on the charm. We live just a few blocks from eachother, you at your own place  and me renting a 1room apartment from a girl that's studying abroad for a year. It was furnished and all so I'm a bit embarrassed with it being so girly.

Today it's Friday evening and you've been working. We've got plans to hang out tomorrow but as you picked up some Chinese food you decided to surprise me with some too as a gift. It's been a hot week and you know I  find the heat hard  to deal with, so as you park your car outside you  see my windows being open. You've tried to teach me not to open windows when there's AC but I  never seem to learn.

You head up the  stairs and as you reach my door you suddenly get the idea to sneak in and see if you can surprise me even more. Without  thinking much further  you carefully feel the door. You've tried teaching me to lock my door, but now it silently swings open for you.  You sneak into the hall  and move forward. You reach the doorway to the right that leads to my  room and - Your eyes widen in surprise, your heart rushing.

Laying there on my stomach on the couch playing stardew valley on my nintendo switch you see me dressed cute girls clothes. My legs are mostly covered by a pair of pink and white striped thigh high socks, revealing just a few inches of pale creamy skin before my short dark pleated skirt covers me up. My legs are lifted up behind me and the roundness of my butt gives you a glimpse in under the skirt where you see frilly white fabric from a pair of panties. My bright blonde hair is tied up in a pair of small pigtails, and my upper body is covered by a tightly fitting white shirt with lacey arms.The look definitely reminds you of a schoolgirl. I've got a pair of large white headphones on and you hear me hum happily to myself as I play, my legs moving slightly against eachother.

Your  heart beats like crazy as you look at me, amazed, almost in awe at how cute I look laying there on the couch amongst the slightly girly pillows. You had no idea I was into this. Admittedly my body is very cute and you've had stray thoughts I look a bit girly but... Wow. You hold the bag with takeout in your hand, and you can tell I haven't noticed you yet."

P,
I want to preface this by saying that this isn’t meant to be vindictive or to make you feel bad or anything. These are just the things I needed you to know. The ones I wanted to tell you that week where I begged you to talk to me. These are all true- you can ask friends and family if you want confirmation. This is what i was crying about the night where you held me and i said I wasn’t ready to tell you. I wanted to wait until your internship was over because i didn’t want you to worry about me while doing something so important. I know there’s no right time to do something like this. But man did you have bad timing. It’s okay though. I’ve accepted why. I just needed you to know. In order of when they happened during the month:
1. I found out my grandparents are even worse. My grandpa molested my aunt, my mom, my sister, and me. I was too young to remember but the formers weren’t so lucky. My grandma knew and didn’t do anything to stop it. I wanted them to die- then I felt horrible about ever wanting anyone to die. I used to love them. They are no longer in my life anymore.
2. I stopped eating. I try to stomach things down but they’d come up still. I’ve been getting better, I’ve been finding ways to get nutrition in me because I refuse to let my body give up on me.
3. My first brother is suicidal. Turns out he has been since sixth grade. Three attempts since then. I found out because I had to pull the chord from around his neck off him. He was screaming and crying, I managed to calm him down. He’s brave because unlike me he asked for help. I was hoping you’d help me support him.
4. I started having suicidal thoughts and thoughts of self harm. As you can guess it’s gotten worse since. I don’t want to be like this, i really don’t. So I’m in therapy now. I’m addressing all of these issues and the ones you brought up in your last text to me. She’s great.
She also told me to continue to write to you, although all of these go unsent. She says it’s good for me to get it out even if there’s no response. So I don’t expect a response from this- although I still really want to have that talk about us (also a good idea my therapist agrees with). Do with this information what you will.
I hope you’re okay. I hope you’re safe. I hope you feel alright enough to talk to me soon. I’ll still always be here for you. I’ll still always be your best friend regardless of all this. And I still love you even if you aren’t mine.

Kinklist: http://i.imgur.com/oAWR8tN.png

**Conservative** I am a small town midwestern girl, I've grown up in a well off republican family. The night Trump won we celebrated like it was the best night of our lives. I've lived my entire life in this rich conservative bubble. I went to a rich college and graduated, although continued to live a fairly sheltered life. Now that I'm graduated I'm traveling outside that bubble and I'm in for a reality check. (this one is open to interpretation and I'd like to discuss it more fully)

**Walk of Shame** I'm about to start my sophomore year of college. I moved into a big old house with 4 other girls in the student ghetto of our medium sized college town. It's still the summer but most of us stayed to have a fun summer before school starts again in September. You are our neighbour. You live there with your wife and young daughter. You're in your mid to late 30s, you've been a good neighbour and have never complained if we make too much noise. We did host one party a few weeks back and it got noisy but you appreciated that my roommate stacey warned you about the noise beforehand and we chipped in and bought you and your wife a bottle of wine. We've become friendly over the last little while and always wave when we see each other. In addition to watching us sunbathe you also get excited for every Saturday and Sunday morning when at least one of us is returning from our night out usually looking a little worse for wear. More often then not it's me doing the walk of shame.

**Festival** We're at a summer music festival, (the type of music is negotiable) but what should be the case is that i'm a bit of a novice at festivals and i'm not a hardcore fan of any of the bands and I'm just here to have fun. We both are going with a large group of friends and friends of friends. I'm here with my boyfriend who is really into some of the more obscure and underground bands while everyone else is interested in the big acts. I want you to play a bit of an alpha male who is part of the friend group who has his eyes set on me. You get to show me the ropes of how partying at a festival works.

**Vacation** Rose is in her senior year of college, her parents said that they wouldn't pay for her to go on a spring break trip with her friends but they would pay if she went with them and her younger brother. She was so annoyed but reluctantly agreed as long as she got her own room and they left her alone for the most part. She just finished an internship as part of her degree with a law firm, it's her hope that upon graduation she'll end up with a job there as she completes her law degree. For now she's not going to worry about work and school she's in the caribbean and she's going to relax by the pool, read a book and get her tan on. Her younger brother and parents tried to convince her to go on a hike but she had no interest. While lounging by the pool she is approached by a much older man, it took her a couple seconds but she realizes that it's one of the senior partners at the law firm.

**Son's Friend** My son has just finished his first year of college. Things have been going well for him and he fits in a bit more at college then he did in high school. He was paired with you as a roommate and now you are both moving into a house together off campus with a few other friends. He seems to have a bit more confidence and has started working out and even has a girlfriend, all of this I put down to your influence. You are an attractive young black man from out of state, you're at school on a scholarship. Because you have moved so far from home you've spent a few school breaks at my house so i've gotten to know you. My marriage has not been going well and my sex life has dried up a bit so i'm a bit sexually frustrated. Lately I've been fantasizing about you, and I'm getting more and more curious about being with a black man.

**Hiking** An experienced hiker, grew up camping with her family and doing long treks. Now out of University for a few years has a boyfriend who she wants to share this interest with. He's not the most outdoorsy though. He won't be having a great time, but it will be a group hike so there might be some other men to catch her interest. (the guide, brother (who brought his new miserable wife, another hiker, a bushman?) all possibilities.

**Babysitter** A classic that's always fun. I'll play a young naive innocent babysitter (18+) and you will play the father of the kids. There are many options for this, we could do it that you're my neighbour down the street, I could be an ""au pair"", I could be asked to go on vacation with you or spend some time with your family at the cottage. Let's talk about this one if it interests you.

Additionally, i don't really have a scene in mind but i'm open to some raceplay scenes so feel free to propose those or any other scenes that you think I may be interested in. Hope to see those nice envelopes soon!

Some other setting ideas that I enjoy include: - school ski trip - Olympic Village - Holiday Party - Tropical Vacation - Wedding (cheating) - Family - snow day - fat or old guy

its me again. I just want to give you a short update on whats going on with the project ([GitHub](https://github.com/AskMeAgain/TangleChain-System)). Currently iam doing my internship so i dont really have that much time to work on the project except for weekends.

Overall iam pretty much done with the Bitcoin stage as you can see on the roadmap:

* We now have an adjustable difficulty. 
* The tools are usable (Miner &amp; Wallet). 
* The Library got more secure &amp; easier to use.

Now i will work on smartcontracts, interoperability and  a new consensus.

TLDR: I wrote a blockchain on top of iota. Right now you can use my tools to create your own chains, let others mine on them, send &amp; receive coins.

9aez30,3,2018-08-26,Looking for a new T after termination. Should I go for a counselling psychologist or a clinical psychologist? Opinions of therapists welcome,sarvam-sarvatmakam,TalkTherapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalkTherapy/comments/9aez30/looking_for_a_new_t_after_termination_should_i_go/,"Ok, you can learn about my saga [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalkTherapy/comments/99dxt3/my_t_told_me_that_she_didnt_know_how_to_help_me/?st=jlas6par&amp;sh=a740d0f4) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalkTherapy/comments/99tysu/can_a_therapist_working_in_a_centre_tell_the/?st=jlas6rjf&amp;sh=e09afb56).

Long story short, went in for anxiety and depression, got diagnosed with narcissistic traits alongside that, read psychology and argued with T, went through cycles of idealization and devaluation, and basically got very little done. Now my T has terminated the sessions and I'm a hot mess. I've been asking around and gotten three referrals so far, all of whom said they'd get back to me. I'm planning for the best case scenario, so I wanted to ask your advice on this.

Therapist 1) Was a counselling intern at my old centre and is now a full-time counsellor, though my ex T called her an intern, while the one who owns the place says she's not an intern. I'm worried she's too inexperienced to handle a case that a clinical psychologist with four years experience couldn't handle. But she sits in a place where i am familiar with so the new place anxiety won't be there.

Therapist 2) Was recommended and vouched for by the owner of the centre. Seems to be more experienced, but is a counselling psychologist and I'm not sure she can handle narcissism, but I don't know.

Therapist 3) Is a clinical psychologist with 4 years more experience than my present T. Is more expensive as well, and says she specializes in CBT. I don't know if that will be a problem but I was assured that someone specializing in something doesn't mean that's all they know how to do.


Adding to all of these will be scheduling problems since I'll have to go after work, and the fact that the relationship is what matters, and I judge people too much and sabotaged my own therapy last time.

So what do you guys have to say? Any advice is welcome. Thanks."

I’m currently in the process of applying to HCI grad programs. My experience in UX is pretty limited, so I’ve decided to take on a full-blown project on my own use as part of my portfolio when applying. I’m currently in the preliminary user research stage.

I’ve done some UI design before both for personal projects and an internship, but I would always use the Adobe Creative Suite. I keep seeing how Sketch is the must-know program for mockups. However, when I went to use a free trial, I realized it’s only for Mac. There are a couple of other programs that are also exclusively Mac.

I don’t have the $1500 to buy a Mac and I probably won’t have it any time soon, so this project is going to be completed with PC-compatible programs. But I was wondering whether you all think it is necessary to invest in a Mac in the near future? Or are there a decent amount of UX professionals here that have stuck with their trusty (and cheap) PCs?

Thanks

**19,583** *readers* for **8 Years!**

Now that pretty much everyone has a digital camera in their pocket, more people have the opportunity to take wonderful pictures with an ease and convenience that was unheard of before smartphones became so accessible. /r/iPhoneography is an image based subreddit dedicated to all iPhone photography, news, tips, and discussions. 

If you are a beginner or a long time photographer this is the sub for you, if you have any questions the community is pretty welcoming and will try to answer your question to the best of their abilities. Make sure to check out their Top Photo Fridays every week at 9am ET, they're also running a photo contest which ends on the 25th so look out for the results. This week's theme is Transportation. 

I have found that every time I visit /r/iPhoneography I am blown away by the photos that are posted on their. I've added quite of  locations to my bucket list after seeing such exquisite photographs. It has also inspired me to try to be more artistic and take more photos while I am out and about. Hope it inspires you as well! 

**A photo is worth a thousand words. So here are some the best posts submitted over on** /r/iPhoneography:

&gt;#What made you want to moderate the sub? 

&gt;&gt;**u/a_knife**  What really made me want to moderate /r/iPhoneography was that about 3 years ago I started taking photos with my iPhone and ever since then I’ve been searching for a community of like minded mobile photographers. I eventually moved on to more professional photography equipment, but nothing will be able to match what you can capture (quickly) on your phone at a random point of your day. 

 

&gt;##What are some of your favorite posts on the sub? 

&gt;&gt;**u/a_knife**  It’s hard to point to an exact favorite. But I can say that I get the most enjoyment out of the ones that show the most passion and enthusiasm in their mobile photography journey. 

&gt;##What are your plans for the sub in the future?

&gt;&gt;**u/a_knife**  The plans consist of being a valuable resource in the mobile photography community, and for like minded people to share their own glimpses of the world around them.

&gt;##Anything else you want to add?

&gt;&gt;**u/a_knife**  I don’t think iPhones are exclusive to mobile photography. Each device has its own strength, and weakness. I just happen to prefer Apple devices over the alternatives. So I would hope the community doesn’t out grow the current friendliness that it offers today. Also, thank you for taking your time to feature the sub!

It all started when I failed a class, I'd grown into quite a sexy young girl without even really knowing it yet. Boys were noticing me and so were my teachers. Approached by one of my teachers, in exchange for letting him fuck me, I would pass. At the time I agreed because I didn't want my dad to know I'd failed... So I just went along with it. That's just what started it, since then I've taken dozens more cocks in all my holes. I don't do it for money, though if they pay I guess that's a bonus, I've just got some sick desire to be dominated and fucked over and over. Treated like a sex object by everyone I encounter...

The thing is, I just wasn't enjoying it as much when they were gentle. When they were kind, and sweet, it was just boring... So I made a rule - I won't say no.

However a guy wants to treat me, no matter how bad, if he wants the roughest, messed up, kinkiest sex ever I will grant him his wish if he'll treat me like the little slut that I am.

That's it, that's all I'm asking, just treat me like a complete slut.

(This is really open ended intentionally, we could play any number of scenes from my boss at my new internship fucking me in the office to me taking on a group of truck drivers in a truck stop to my dad finding out about my behaviors and punishing me the way a slut ought to be punished.... You can lure me home however you like, whoever you are, this slut doesn't really care. Get a little creative though, this is almost no limits, if you've ever wanted to dabble in watersports, slavery, general rough play, even beast, now might be the time! Let's have some fun!)"

**BANG BANG BANG BANG**

My father lied in his bed, exhausted but unable to sleep over the loud sounds coming from his door. All he could do was watch the door shake violently in rhythm, looking ready to break right off its hinges at any moment. 

Just on the other side of his door were two  people my father knew quite well. There was me, his teenage daughter, my face and overdeveloped chest being slammed against the door again and again. And there was Darius, the absolute bane of my poor father’s existence. 

Ever since they met in middle school, Darius had gone out of his way to make every day of my dad’s life a living nightmare. His family is incredibly wealthy and powerful, so he’s never once had to experience any sort of repercussions for his actions. Darius would beat him so badly he had to be hospitalized regularly. And that was nothing compared to the psychological and emotional torture he put him through. There was the time my father actually managed to get a girlfriend...until Darius tied him to a chair and fucked her with his enormous horse cock right in front of him. Or when my grandmother - a gorgeous, sexy MILF at the time - finally tried to stand up for my father, and Darius wound up fucking her, taking a picture with his cock resting next to her cum covered face, on top of what was clearly your pillow from your bed, then printed out copies and put them up all over school. The locker rooms were torture of course, especially since my father has a medically diagnosed condition called “baby penis syndrome”, meaning his penis never grew since birth. Hence his nickname, “Baby Dick”, that stuck with him all throughout school. Darius even had the teachers calling him that when he used his father’s power to change his name in the school’s system. 

My father somehow survived these years of torture, and moved as far away as he could to go to college. Miraculously, he actually managed to get a girl to let him have sex with her, and although she laughed when he dropped his pants and he came the moment his dick touched her pussy, she got pregnant with me. She wanted nothing to do with me, and he was given full custody. He managed to get a decent paying job in a generic corporate office as an accountant, and while we didn’t have much, we were still getting by and very close. 

That was until Darius turned up in his life yet again. 

He waltzed into my father’s office building one day, and somehow - just like in high school - Darius always got just what he wanted, and by that afternoon, somehow Darius had become my father’s boss. He was immediately given a pay cut, in fact being declared an unpaid intern. His workload however, increased 10 fold. From scrubbing toilets to doing paperwork for everyone in the office, he was running around all day for pennies. 

But at least he still had me, his little honeybee. That’s what he kept telling himself as his nightmare returned with you entering his life again. That made it all the worse when he came home after cleaning the office after hours again one night to find Darius in the kitchen, me lying naked on my back on the table, trying to moan but unable as Darius’ huge hands are wrapped tight around my throat while he drives his cock in and out of my tight little pussy. He just grinned, released one hand off my throat so he could flip my father the bird, and slammed forward one final time before he dumped his huge load inside me. 

Fast forward a few weeks, and I was now “dating” Darius, though really he just fucks me in depraved, rough, nasty ways all over the house and the office day and night, and it brings us to now. 

**”LISTEN TO THE SOUND OF ME DESTROYING YOUR DUMB FUCKING BITCH OF A DAUGHTER YOU FUCKING LOSER!!”** Darius roared as he grabbed a fistful of my hair, pulling on it hard like reins as he fucked my ass raw as hard as he could, taunting my father the whole time. **”TELL HIM, WHORE! TELL HIM YOU LOVE MY COCK MORE THAN HIM!”**

“I love your big monster cock daddy!” I cried out between my moans and grunts. Darius made it very clear I was to call him daddy, especially around my father. “Mmm I love it so much more than anything or anyone, especially my loser old dad!”

9agcml,164,2018-08-26,Tom Woods on McCain,steeled_iron,Anarcho_Capitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/9agcml/tom_woods_on_mccain/,"John McCain is dead.

People tell me I should not criticize him right now.

I do think some people are behaving in bad taste. But I do not think I am prohibited from making sober remarks at a moment when so many Americans, and the opinion molders who tell them what to think, are getting ludicrously carried away.

The phenomenon we are witnessing is so Orwellian that I can't resist exploring it. I am less concerned with criticizing McCain -- there will be ample time for that -- than I am with trying to understand the regime under which we live, and the media lackeys that glorify it.

The tributes to McCain from the major newspapers are so over the top that there's something more going on here than the perfunctory respect the media shows for most deceased politicians.

They will not be speaking this way about Pat Buchanan -- a real maverick, who was the first conservative I ever saw who broke with both parties (that's what a maverick does) to point out that the sanctions on Iraq were creating a humanitarian catastrophe that no moral person could support (that's what an actual conservative says).

As if to show that she has every Establishment ritual already down to a science, even democratic socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez took to Twitter to say this:

John McCain’s legacy represents an unparalleled example of human decency and American service.

As an intern, I learned a lot about the power of humanity in government through his deep friendship with Sen. Kennedy.

He meant so much, to so many. My prayers are with his family.

""But she had to say something!"" some say.

She had to say ""an unparalleled example of human decency and American service""?

McCain's bellicosity in foreign policy knew no bounds. A discussion of all the interventions he favored -- every one of which would have intensified the problems it was allegedly to solve -- would take all week.

To a conservative movement that knows nothing of its history, this makes McCain a great conservative statesman.

And to the American Establishment, bellicosity is not and has never been a deal breaker.

McCain's preferred foreign policy has yielded death, displacement, and regional chaos on a massive scale, not to mention a huge shot in the arm to the very Islamic radicalism he assured us he was fighting against.

(McCain's insistence on being involved in every Middle East conflict under the sun made him some hideous bedfellows, I might add, as when he met with members of the Northern Storm Brigade, which had handed American journalist Steven Sotloff over to ISIS for $25,000.)

We are to believe that McCain was a ""maverick.""

This is because from time to time he joined forces with the Democrats, the left-wing side of the Establishment, in order to support a measure that just happened to win him media applause.

That's our definition of a maverick now?

Ron Paul was a maverick.

He stood up to the entire Establishment, not just its left-wing incarnation, and its beloved institutions.

He cast the sole ""no"" vote in the House more than all other congressmen put together.

He opposed the Fed when no one else so much as mentioned it, much less criticized it.

He stood up to the empire -- the whole rotten system, not just one particular intervention. He even got it through the thick heads of some conservatives that the bipartisan foreign policy consensus represented the very opposite of conservatism.

Will our gatekeepers of approved opinion have such kind words for Ron Paul? The question answers itself.

The last thing the regime and its kept media want is a genuine maverick, a true dissident who asks the questions we are supposed to keep to ourselves.

McCain loved the regime and the empire. At no time did he adopt a position that the New York Times or the Washington Post would consider a fundamental attack on the state.

And that is why they love him. He played by their rules.

They were thrilled to call him a ""conservative,"" all the better to police opinion in America: why, if you're a conservative, we have this John McCain fellow for you!

McCain's legacy lives on in every politician and journalist who jumps on every propaganda report to justify another round of bombing and destruction.

It lives on in every politician who, 15 years after another idiotic military intervention, finally admits it was a ""mistake,"" never apologizing to the people he smeared at the time who tried telling him it was a mistake and who predicted every obvious consequence that any damn fool should have known.

It lives on in a media that craves bipartisanship -- but bipartisanship in the service of the state, and bipartisanship in which the left gets what it wants and the right gets a nice photo-op.

It lives on in the families who are missing children because of a war that McCain finally admitted had been a hideous mistake and a ludicrous expenditure of scarce resources.

McCain was a man of the state, in every fiber of his being. That is why they cheer him.

And that is why we must tell unpopular truths -- about McCain, and the corrupt empire he served."
9agglm,44,2018-08-26,"My [21, F] Boyfriend [22, M] makes me feel terrible about myself when he thinks he's 'encouraging' me",ImmediateStar99102,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9agglm/my_21_f_boyfriend_22_m_makes_me_feel_terrible/,"I'm going into my final year of university and currently don't really have a clear direction of what to do career wise. I applied for a number of internships in various fields I was interested in and got rejected from them until I got a message from the CEO of the internship I just finished doing asking if I was free this summer. I both view and know myself to be a person who gives everything an opportunity, I try things I have no experience in and see if they're for me. Without listing off my CV, I have participated in organising TEDx events twice, I've done a few Insight Days at Investment Banks with a few more lined up, I'm looking into Corporate Law and so applied for a few Insight Days there and am also considering applying for an internship or grad scheme in the Civil Service. There are a lot of potential options but at the moment I am open to exploring them all.

There was this one particular Corporate Law Mentorship Scheme I got an interview for, and as this was in the midst of the first two weeks of my internship, due to my own fault I completely forgot I had an interview on the day I had it so instead of do it completely unprepared (it had to be a presentation on a topic of your choice), I cancelled. When I told my boyfriend this, he completely flipped. He said I shouldn't have cared as much about the internship as it isn't something I actually wanna do careerwise (which is true), and that I should have put effort into this. I already felt awful about having to decline the opportunity but there's no point feeling bad about this, I just have to pick myself up and apply for the next opportunity.

Fast forward to today, I was talking to my boyfriend on the phone and I wasn't in a great mood. I've been thinking about the future recently and I'm worried about how likely it is we can maintain a relationship if we both want such high intensity jobs, to me my relationship is more important, but to him work is everything. We were talking about a friend of mine and how she struggled finding a job after graduation and that he was worried that was the case for me. I said no because we are different people, I'm quite an opportunistic person so have done a few career-related things as they've come up at uni whereas she didn't think about jobs until after graduation (which there's nothing wrong with btw). He scoffed at that and said sure which is when I asked him what he meant and that's where the argument began.

He said I like to believe my own narrative that I'm opportunistic and that's what I'd like to view myself as, whereas in reality I don't try that hard. It was a long conversation so to cut it short: he thinks he is only helping me by being stern and telling me the things I need to hear (a kind of kick up the a\*\*), that he has high expectations of me and he's only doing this because he's worried I won't achieve my best, he wants me to do a career I enjoy, he said I was making excuses when I said my internship was tiring (9am-6pm with a 3 hour round trip commute), he's afraid of me being in the same position as my friend and said how languages grads like me have a higher rate of going into PR and Marketing which he's worried I will, he thinks I accept rejection and let it get to me, that I give opportunities a half-hearted attempt so never get them and lastly that I didn't try hard enough to find job-related opportunities during the first term of my year abroad (during which he knows I was only in bed and alone a lot because I was severely depressed and stuck in a terrible living situation with my then roommate which was moderately traumatising).

I appreciate his concern and I know it's all coming from a place of care but I let him know that it is deeply hurting me. I don't feel like he is encouraging me, I just think his 'straight-to-the-point' approach focuses on making me feel like a lazy s\*\*\* that doesn't do anything and has no motivation to succeed. It's worse because he works and he loves what he does and the prospect of climbing the corporate ladder. He knows he wants to do his MA in Stanford, his company works with a big consulting firm at the moment who he loves to socialise with and in general he just knows what he wants careerwise way more than I do. I have never felt pressure to succeed from my parents or anyone else, I only want to have a good career for myself and no one else but he makes me feel so under pressure when he has these 'talks' with me and like I'm not good enough when I know I am. He makes me feel like I'm doomed for failure because I didn't go to that one interview that I already regret not going to. I just feel like I'm constantly letting him down and that he looks down on me, whereas he looks up to those amazing corporate ladder climbers he works with.

I don't know where to go from here, after saying all of that he was still adamant he was right. I don't want to completely not have any of his help but more when I ask for it and for him to change his approach from stern to encouraging, but I don't know if he would just think I'm making excuses again. I missed his call and when I called back he said he was busy and that he'll talk to me about it later. I'm meeting him tomorrow so I need to know what to say. I don't know who's in the right or wrong, but I know I just don't want to feel s\*\*\*\*y about my career prospects. Any advice on what to say / how to handle this?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My boyfriend says I am not trying hard enough to get further with my career prospects when I feel like I am doing my best. I understand he means it from a good place but I feel like he is too stern and deeply hurting me by making me feel like a failure rather than encouraging me. Had a massive argument over this and am meeting him tomorrow, what should I say? Am I in the wrong?"

Saying it ruined our family because we don’t go visit her enough. 
      
One of my brothers moved back to our home country and the other one lives about 2 hours away as do I. We all have jobs and lives and I’m the only one (in the US) that has a car to even visit. But between an internship, a mall job and two freelance gigs this summer I haven’t been able to visit much. Which also keeps me sane.

After some time and thinking I’ve come to realize that my mom might have moved here to live with my stepdad. Who she met on a trip. When she was married to my bio dad. My bio dad was no good either. Has a history of being abusive, physically and verbally. While my stepdad is an alcoholic and also pretty verbally abusive himself. I think growing up I was so focused on how terrible my dads were that I always saw my mom in a shining light. My brother (who is only 1.5years older than me) always had trouble with his temper and depression growing up. Which is what my parents mostly focused on. Letting me fall into the background. I think the moment I truly realized how much my mom didn’t know about me was when over at a friend of hers house for my birthday, she told them my favorite food was tacos. Which they made and I was forced to eat. It’s the only food I dislike. And it was small but it just lead to me noticing bigger things. 

The moment I noticed an issue with my mother was when I left for college. Up until that moment I thought everyone got anxious around their parents. And that everyone’s moms cried all the time and said hurtful things. I thought everyone had to listen to their moms threaten to kill herself. But the more friends I made, the more I read and studied. The more I noticed the signs of a toxic relationship. She would visit and I would always end up feeling like she sucked my soul out. She’s always leave with a mean comment trailing behind her. That I gained weight, that I was a bad daughter, etc. 

She’s sent me countless of books and movies about being a better daughter. About loving others more. But she was also the one that told me at 8 years old, that she never wanted to have kids. That my grandma wanted to have me aborted as to not take attention from my brothers. How she once left us at our aunts house to kill herself but came back instead. 

A year ago my brother (still in the states) and I met up and talked. And realized that she always told us things about the other to make us hate each other. And since we’ve stopped listening to her we’ve realized how much we are alike. And have supported each other when she visits and leaves a wreckage behind. It’s crazy to think that for 22 years we just didn’t speak. We both agreed that we tried to hide as much as we could at home. And prayed that one day we could leave. And we did. 

I’ve tried very hard the last few years to accommodate my mom and make a place in my life for her. To try to be patient because I know she suffers from a handful of mental illnesses. But it’s been extremely hard. Every visit leaves me crying, anxious and empty inside. She was the reason I was so depressed as a child. Considering suicide at a young age. And this whole time I thought it was me. That I was a bad kid because she kept telling me so. 

She came to visit yesterday. After two weeks of guilt tripping me because I haven’t seen her or have been too busy to let her stop by. She talked about the new friends she has lunch with every week, about my bedroom which she is remodeling and somehow managed to slip in how she thinks I’ll hit my children when I have them. Because I’m not nice and too strict. She’s always said things about me being rude or strict. And it’s something that I still struggle with. I have discipline which she has never been able to master. And I’ve worked with kids for 4 years in hope of never becoming like her. 

My friend (also roommate) was with me at the time that she said that and we both stared wide eyed as she went on about how my kids would have fun at her house.  And she would teach them to lie so I wouldn’t hit them for having fun. She instantly went to the bathroom when we disagreed with her statement and my roommate whispered his apologizes for her. I had to spend the next 3 hours with her as she shopped for clothing and acted like she hadn’t told me I would make a terrible parent. 

Growing up with my bio dad being physically abusive has always been something my brother and I never forgot. When my mom would get angry she’d always tell my brother how much he was like our dad. And I’d always have to beg her to stop. She’s never compared me to him before. But I think I now know my brothers pain. She left yesterday and said I love you but I could only nod. I went inside my home and cried. I’ve always wanted to be a mom. But by having a child, she’ll force her way into my family no matter what. And I don’t trust her around any other human. She somehow manages to make everyone feel they’re completely worthless. 

Anyway, I know there’s worse moms out there. And she at the very least brought me here and has helped me get my degree. But talking to her drains me, makes me anxious and makes me believe the only way to truly escape her is by killing myself. I don’t really know what to do. She puts up a facade to everyone who isn’t family and they’re all convinced she’s wonderful. She was one of my high school teachers so I could never bring this up to anyone back then. Now that I can, the more I notice how messed up it is. 
What can I do? I have to get away from her. "

&amp;#x200B;

I've been single for about a year now. Before that I went through a difficult, 4 year relationship with a girl who had OCD, was suicidal etc. Eventually I had the heart to break up because I saw that staying in that relationship would destroy me.

In the past year I've been dating alot. Some genuine dates here and there, but mostly no-strings-attached, casual, tinder dates.. That sort. I was fine with that. I figured that I still enjoy being single, the freedom that it brings - not just so that I could have sex with anyone I want, but also because I still wanna travel and be free. I guess I was open-minded to meeting a new ''spark''.. but the right one just didn't come along yet. I guess I also needed more time and that I was still recovering from my last relationship. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last thursday I had a date with a girl I met on tinder. She told me beforehand that she's leaving to capetown in a week for an internship, but I figured a drink couldn't hurt. Always interesting to meet someone new right?

One thing led to another and we slept together that night. But we didn't just sleep together, we made love.. the kind I had forgotten about for a long, long time. The next day we stayed in bed all morning, cuddling, having sex, laughing. Yesterday I slept with her again.. same story.. we spent the whole day cuddling, laughing, getting lunch, etc. This is just on another level than what I felt in the past years. 

Now I'm home again. I'm gonna see her for one more time this week.. after that she'll be gone for four months. I know it won't work to keep in touch since we both still want to go our own ways and see the world. But I feel sad knowing that I FINALLY felt true love again, and have to say goodbye to it already. I hate to place myself in a victim role but at moments like these I just feel like some trick is being played on me. I feel sad, dissapointed, angry.. Why do I finally meet someone I could have a normal, loving relationship.. all while I know it will be taken away from me in a matter of days?

I know I just need to get through this. I will feel fine in a week and perhaps we even forget about each other in a matter of weeks.. but still.. at this point I feel so sad and lonely. "
9ah9qu,120,2018-08-26,Notes from Micron talk from a Senior Fellow at UC Berkeley,Shivin302,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9ah9qu/notes_from_micron_talk_from_a_senior_fellow_at_uc/,"I am a student of UC Berkeley and I attended a talk from Micron at the university (if mods want proof I can give). Obviously, I have calls and shares at the company like y'all, so I took lots of notes during the presentation and hope you guys will enjoy. TLDR at bottom.

* Out of 35000 Employees there are 4 Senior Fellows. The presenter was a Senior Fellow.
* Interns say that their work is super impactful to the company.
* Sanjay and university recruiter are from UCB and favor the university. More nerds = better company
* Moving up hierarchy to memory sub systems. 7th largest semiconductor. 3rd largest memory.
* Micron provides infrastructure to big companies like Apple or Google to store and pull data. Data is currency of business.
* 20,000+ patents overall.
* Only competitor with companies and business all over the world. Samsung is in Korea. Toshiba in Japan.
* Industry trends
* Compute and Networking - Biggest growth is in data centers
* Embedded - Autos using Micron memory increasingly
* Storage - NAND flash memory displacing HDD in data centers. Mobile using DRAM and flash storage
* 5 years ago Micron was only in memory and fast storage. Now into primary storage, software, platform.
* 3D Xpoint, their new memory technology with Intel, has good middle between DRAM and NAND cost vs latency. It’s the newest technology after 25 years when NAND was invented.
* Data generation increasing exponentially. For example, viewing a video makes its data go from DRAM to NAND in system then to the cloud in a data center’s DRAM then its NAND.
* Artificial intelligence requires either in your own devices or in the cloud data centers. Cloud latency too high so self-driving cars require in device memory, which Micron makes.
* Currently in AI cars we have ADAS technology. In 2020+ there will be autonomous driving. Senior Fellow was very bullish on this. Needs 4x storage 6x memory.
* Google uses tensor PU; Apple uses neural PU instead of CPU GPU for AI. All these consume lots of data fast. Training and models are huge and cannot be stored purely in memory.
* Their R&amp;D are looking at doing processing in memory for AI. Even further is analog compute, directly on memory.
* Qualcomm Broadcomm Apple don't manufacture silicon, while Micron makes everything from scratch. 
* NAND Flash currently at 3D NAND technology. 3 Generations. Gen 1 32 tiers. Gen 2 64 tiers. Gen 3 96 tiers.
* Memory technology is so volatile and prices increased so much because the cyclical prices are supply demand driven. Previously, companies would invest and oversupply during high prices, driving the prices down a lot and eventually destroying multiple companies. It takes 5-10b to build a new supply factory. Nowadays manufacturers are disciplined. Do not oversupply during highs. 
* Historically there were more companies less stability. Hedge funds hedge against downturn with low Price/Earnings multiple. Now there are 4 stable companies that are not oversupplying and creating volatility. Senior Fellow thinks MU should trade at 15 P/E.

TLDR: AI technology and Data centers are the future and need lots of memory. 3D Xpoint is also a technology to be bullish over. Hedge funds trade MU at a low P/E multiple because they think the industry is volatile, but Senior Fellow thinks that it has become a lot more stable and disciplined, so it should trade at a 15 P/E."

I'm currently doing an internship at a startup company in QC. I'm not fond of web development but I try my best to embrace the field because most companies in the Philippines with a higher pay are under the said field. What I really wanted to do is machine learning, computer vision, data science and bioinformatics. I always loved data and play around with it. I learn online too. I can't settle on full employment yet because I have to fulfill a scholarship obligation which requires me to teach for two years and it's gonna start on November. 
I'm currently financially challenged. I need to support myself. No company in the country offers internship to fresh grads on the computer science fields that I like. I'm trying to like web development so I can do part-time work while teaching in the next two years.

TL;DR
How should I choose which field to focus? 
Pay in the industry is really great(Web development = practical choice). Research is fulfilling and exciting. Academe is being able to influence the younger generation.
I just want to do research and get a high pay. Is that possible in the Philippines?

9ahsh3,7,2018-08-26,Turns out THE love of my life is A love of my life,sonnenscheinchen43,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/9ahsh3/turns_out_the_love_of_my_life_is_a_love_of_my_life/,"I share this because the thought of potentially never stopping to love him doesn't have to be a bad thing.
I haven't  been on Reddit in month and month and decided to get a new account. A bit over a year ago I was here, constantly reading about all these break up stories (which helped) but pretty much thought my life was over.
The guy who broke up with me was my best short distance friend for a year, then my best long distance friend for two. When we finally met again after those two years when I flew in from germany (where we met when he studied aborad there ) to see him in florida, my long time obession and deep affection for him turned into us having sex, him becoming my first boyfriend, right away meeting all his family (who apparently knew a lot about me already) and so on. 
I really just was the happiest 22 year old ever. I visited him 4 times that year since he couldn't leave work and I was just a student and had way more free time. We talked about moving in together I'm germany, both doing our master there, how our kids would be so cute and all the other things you talk about when you think you have forever..
After I spent Christmas there I had the feeling that his family was really pressuring in going to law school but he kept saying he wasn't. I told him that I want him to be happy and if that's what he wants, I support him going for it.
 It was clear that we would break up if he stayed in the states and that's what happend in January after my Christmas in florida. He called me to tell me that he should probably go to law school and that that meant that we had to end it. Since I wanted him to be happy but on the same time knew that deep down, he mostly wanted to please his parents..it felt like that that was more important to him then his future plans with me.
I was so heartbroken. All my plans for the future included him, I thought that no guy would ever be as good as he was and all of that.

So how I recovered:
1. I blocked him everywhere so I could stalk him 
2. I had a girlfriend moving in for couple of days right after the breakup because she only came back to our college town to take some exams and didn't have an apartment anymore..looking back, that helped to much. She hold me accountable to study instead of crying in my bed all day
3. I wrote him a looooong letter and basically said goodbye in there
4. I never spoke bad about him 
5. When he reached out month later, telling me he would come to Germany before law school to see friends I wished him the best but refused meeting up with him
6.. after 4 month I felt like he could look at his Instagram without crying and when I saw a picture with a girl looking like me I got a bit sad and then somewhat happy for him. After all, he is a great person and deserves to have someone being there for him if it could be me
7. I moved to a new city to do an internship and on my first night there I downloaded a dating app..next day, I met a guy for coffee and now, a year later, we live together and while he is gone often for work while I started my master, when I lay in bed at night, it's my current boyfriend I muss.. I never thought I could miss someone as much as I missed Josh but it's possible. 
Now I can talk about the times I went to Florida to see that incredibly guy and all the crazy things I experienced there..I never thought I could talk about him without getting super sad but it's possible now. Sometimes, I see things on the internet (he is not blocked anymore but also doesn't post often)..he seems to be doing well at law school, got a great internship, seems to be happy with his new girlfriend ..
I'm truly happy for him, I think it's because a part of me will always love him so I can't be bitter or sad for him.
I think he will always love me too and would be happy if he knew how happy I'm with my life and boyfriend now. 
It's the kind of love I wouldn't be jealous about, if my boyfriend had it for his ex girlfriend. "
9ahy9p,1,2018-08-26,Credit - No plans to make large purchases/take a loan out in the near future (2-3 years). Get more CCs or just increase credit limit?,big-mango,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9ahy9p/credit_no_plans_to_make_large_purchasestake_a/,"**Some context:**

According to the financial flowchart provided by this sub, I'm on [step 2]. I'm still in college, but because I have a fair amount of year-round income through my internships (around $17-20 / hr depending on the company) and I live in a low cost of living area, I am able to throw usually over 50% of my end of month income into my savings account after accounting for my expenses (this includes making minimum payments on my student loans).

I currently have 3 credit cards, and I use them for groceries (I have autopay set-up such that I always pay the entire balance far in advance) or for items where having the CCs' extended warranty policies is a good idea.

**Monthly Spending (for those who asked):**

* Car payment (financed a 2014 ford focus in 2015): $340/month

* Student loan payment (I do this to help decrease my accrued interest): $200/month (I round up from $168)

* Groceries: ~$200/month (I live with my SO, so I buy for 2 people.)

* Fuel: ~$80/month

* Gym membership: $22 / month (cheaper than 2 memberships. I can take my SO with me as a guest.)

* Music sub: $5 / month

* Protonmail sub: 4 EUR / month = ~$5 / month

* Rent: $0 (My SO covers rent while I'm in college. Yes, I'm lucky.)

* Healthcare: $0 (I joined WI's medicaid (or medicare. this terminology sucks) program (badgercare+) in May 2018, and I haven't received any paperwork regarding a flat, yearly cost, so I'm assuming this is $0 until more information is received.)

* Executive Costco Membership:  -$34 / year (thank you extra 2% from executive membership + citi costco card)

This month's income @ $17/hr = ~$2094

Total monthly expenses = ~$850

This month's savings = ~$1244

**My Credit Cards (for those who asked):**

[Citi Costco Card](https://www.citi.com/credit-cards/credit-card-details/citi.action?ID=Citi-costco-anywhere-visa-credit-card) (I primarily shop at Costco, so this was worth it.)

[Atira Credit](https://www.atiracredit.com/) (My 1st credit card. My credit score was undefined when I got it through my CU, so this served its purpose.)

[Amex Cash Magnet](https://www.americanexpress.com/us/credit-cards/card/cash-magnet/) (I use this as a buffer to ensure I don't go over ~10% usage on any individual credit card.)


**My Question:**

Because I have 1 hard inquiry (total) that will be dropping-off of my credit score fairly soon and given that I have no intentions to make large purchases in the next 2-3 years, which is the better idea for increasing my credit score?

* get another credit card to increase my credit line + # of accounts
* just increase my credit limits to increase my credit line

Thanks for reading!"

I’ve been doing it since high school, and now I’ve found myself studying computer science at an Ivy League university, surrounded by people who know what they are doing and what they want to do.

In my Freshman year, I wore a suit and talked to recruiters at the career fair. I signed up for business classes. I complained about how many problem sets I had to do, and laughed at the liberal arts kids with my fellow engineering classmates.

The Ivy League, in my experience, splits students into two groups. The depressing group is composed of students that get below the mean. These students have been told by their parents and teachers that they’re smart. They were top of their high school, and they built a persona around being smart. But then at an Ivy they get crushed by more prepared and smarter students, and they’ve lost their identity. The other group, the group that gets above the mean, is even more depressing. These students have been told by their parents and teachers that they’re smart. They were top of their high school too, and they built a persona around being smart. And then when their grades come back, they are further reaffirmed that they are smart, and continue on with life.

I was lucky to be in the second group. My high school prepared me well. I performed above average even without going to all the lectures and half-assing the homework assignments. It feels OK knowing you’re above average at one of the best schools in the nation.  I knew plenty of people who were doing better than me, but I felt pretty comfortable. So here I am. Doing well in my classes, learning about computer science and business. Hearing and thinking about some some Silicon Valley or Wall Street Internship. I might be able to get it I was able to speak to people.
	
But I don’t really feel good about it, which is why I’m writing this. I don’t feel like I’m developing character, and if I am, it’s not the person I want to be. I use to read, you know? I use to love reading in middle school. I’d read multiple books each week. All of high school I didn’t read a single book and all of Freshman year I hadn’t either. I use to argue about politics and ethics too. Not anymore. I just feel like I’ve lost depth and character, and now everywhere I look I see other people who have no depth or character. I do my problem sets, I think I’m cool for doing some stupid math proof, I go to some party maybe, I talk to someone who had an internship at some big company last summer, I go to sleep. Repeat. Everything seems fake, yet I know the issue is me, not the world. I don’t want to attend another bullshit business lecture. I don’t want to graduate and wear suits and work at some unethical tech or finance company. I want to make stuff, but I don’t know what. I want to better myself most importantly, and I don’t see any prospective career doing that for me. I just see myself settling in, raking in money, and dying.

I recently dropped my business minor, and applied to a philosophy minor. I don’t know if I actually want to do that. I started reading again. I’m currently reading High Fidelity by Nick Hornby and listening to mopey indie and British rock bands. I feel more in tune with myself but not satisfied. I don’t feel like hanging out with other people. I don’t feel like applying for internships.

I’ve finally admitted to myself that I have no idea what I want to do, but I don’t know where to go from here."

I am still on the hunt to do a literate fandom romance rp. Below are a few plot ideas, but I'm open to any you may have! (Note: These are Canon x OC, with you playing the canon role)

New Royal Crush (M x F or M x M)

Bowser x OC Bowser grew tired of chasing Princess Peach. He knew she didn't feel the same way he did. So he decided to pursue a new person...

This can be kidnapping, or maybe Bowser shows a sweet side. Up to you!

Not for Long (M x M)

Wallace Wells x OC (Scott Pilgrim Rp) When Scott brings over his new friend from work, Wallace outs on his usual moves. His best friend telling him the cute boy is straight won't stop him...

The Lab Intern (M x F or M x M) Professor Birch x OC (Pokemon) When Professor Birch was told he would get a new intern, he wasn't expecting someone so cute. As his feelings grow by the day, what will he do?

SHE/HE'S MINE! (M x F or M x M) BTR guys x OC (Big Time Rush) After a new up and coming artist moves into the Palm Woods, the guys go crazy for them (except for Kendall). Who will this new artist choose?

This is a love rivalry plot.

New to the Force (M x M) The Ginyu Force x OC (Dragon Ball Z) After Guildo left, the Ginyu force hired a new member- but weren't expecting someone so adorable and begin fighting over him. What will he do?

This is a love rivalry plot.

Game on, dude! (M x F or M x M) Bastion, Chumley and Hassleberry x OC (Yugioh GX) After a new student moved to Duel Academy, the guys couldn't resist them. Who will the newbie go for?

I will play pretty much all other characters in this, and it's a love rivalry.

Colors (M x M) Beast Boy x OC (Teen Titans) Beast Boy never thought he would love again. Until a cute boy joined their team... Wait, did he like guys? How will he deal with his feelings as they grow stronger?

Moving on (M x F or M x M) Tom x OC (Star vs the forces of evil After getting dumped by Star for Marco, Tom never thought he'd love again... Until someone new comes into his sights...

If none of these strike your fancy, feel free to give me your ideas/fandoms! Other fandoms I enjoy but don't have a specific plot for: Adventure Time, Avatar the last airbender, Disney, Inuyasha, Left 4 Dead, Legend of Korra, Total Drama

⭐⭐ Here are my rules:

1. Please be literate. No text talk or bad grammar (minus the occasional slip up of course).

2. I only rp in 3rd person. This is non-negotiable. Please be okay doing 3rd.

3. I ONLY PLAY UKE/SUB, NEVER DOM!!!! MY CHARACTERS ARE SUBS ONLY!!!! You have been warned!!!!

4. Be okay with OC x canon

5. Please be an active role player overall. We all have lives but please don't just disappear for days on end and never return.

6. If you are looking for all smut, you have come to the wrong place. I am fine with a build up to smut, but I want there to be a focus on romance and plot.

7. Please be respectful of me. I am a very friendly person but the quickest way to end an rp with me is to treat me badly. I am a human that deserves dignity like everyone else. Insult me once and it's over.

8. I'm sorry, but if your profile pic has a real person in it, I would ask that you change it before rping. It really just throws me off as weird as that sounds (anime/cartoon pics, scenery and anything else really are fine).

9. I usually do written bios, but if you HAVE to have pictures, I only do anime/cartoon refs and will only accept the same. NO REAL LIFE PICS PLEASE!!!

I am fine with people of all gender expressions, as long as you play M! My timezone is EST US time. All characters will be 18+. I am working most of today but I will reply as soon as possible.

I think that's it? If interested, kik:

Hope to rp soon!

Because of this I am at home living with my parents for the first time in a long time (always spent summer working internships in other cities). I was going to counseling at school where my therapist thought I had depression and then when I was out of school, I started seeing a therapist who seemed really judgmental of me so I stopped and never really found anyone else. Then I stopped seeing someone for about 3 months. But the therapist I was seeing gave me some tests and said I tested severe for both anxiety and depression, and after lurking on this sub and reading online I've basically realized I've had anxiety my entire life but for some reason in the last year or so it has surfaced to the extreme and I can no longer cope with it the way I somehow did when I was younger. I often act on impulse and feel I am not in control of myself, my heart races so much, I have such a fear of dying or things going wrong and I have these annoying tendencies like having to touch something with every finger or click something constantly when I'm uncomfortable or nervous. It's wrecked relationships with people close to me and basically I'm just really ready to make a change and conquer this. The main problem with this is now I am living with my parents in my hometown for the first time in like 3 years. I love them, however they feel horribly triggering to me. They play loud music early in the morning which stresses me out. They will tell me to quit being lazy and do something when they don't realize my anxiety is preventing me from leaving the house. My family also for some reason seems to thrive off of putting each other down or making fun of each other in some weird humorous way and I hate it. There's always a weird tension. My mom loves to talk and says the same things over and over again and it just makes me stressed. They leave their house so messy when I like things really clean and it drives me crazy. We also have very differing political views and I get really anxious because I feel like I can't speak up. I just don't fit in here and it really feels super unhealthy in a time where I am specifically trying to focus on getting better. I know a lot of these problems are my own and they shouldn't have to change as people to accommodate my needs, but they really just don't understand that this is something I can't really control all the time and I hate feeling put down for something I'm trying to heal. I'm just so discouraged. Has anyone else had experience with this or have any advice? Also, I've never taken medication and it's something I want to try but is it good to start that right away or therapy first? I am just really lost, have no friends to talk to, and really just need any help or support anyone can give. I'm sorry for the rambling ): "

I'm (M24) is fairly shy and my personality is ISFJ if that helps to get an idea of the situation. Next Sunday is the last day of summer work for me and the other interns, and there's a girl (F22) I would like to ask to grab a coffee with me.


This is my first time asking someone for a date/grabbing a coffee. One reason would be to challenge myself by stepping out of my comfort zone, and the other reason is that she seems like a lovely person (yes... She also cute). We haven't really spoken that much during work, but at least she seems to enjoy my jokes. 

I think it's a tiny bit difficult to get to know without hanging out one on one (that's when I feel most comfortable). If she says ""no, thanks"" it would still feel like something positive by conquering my fear of being rejected, so I don't think that would make it weird for anyone of us.


Any advice for how I should ask her without making her uncomfortable?
Middle or end of the work shift?"

We usually get to see each other twice a year, once 2 weeks during Christmas and for about 2 months during my summer vacation. I thought saying goodbye was finally getting easier ( I used to be very sad and depressed for about a week before leaving and a week after I got back, but this time I was still able to enjoy myself the week before leaving) the thing is I really didn't want to think about my return flight, I thought I was leaving on the 28th turns out it's the 27th and that's tomorrow. I'm just so sad and depressed right now.... I really don't want to leave him I'll miss him so much. 

Coming September my school will start again, and from January to the end of the school year we have the option to go on an internship abroad. I want to do this so badly but I've been looking for a spot all summer and haven't found anything.. I need to get the working holiday visa to be able to stay here longer but the Canadian government website says the chances of me getting invited to apply are very low.... 
Does anyone have any experience with getting a visa in Canada? If so what can I do?"

We both ended up going to the same college(2010). Not because we planned it that way the college just gave us both very generous financial aid packages.

&amp;#x200B;

While in college we were good. I loved this girl and I knew I wanted to be with her for the rest of my life very early on. And she reciprocated those feelings as well. She moved away(2013) for an internship her senior year and before she came back we took a break for a month or two because of the distance. We got back together and were madly in love. I proposed to her in 2015.

&amp;#x200B;

We got married in 2016. She got pregnant about 2 months later. And we had a beautiful daughter in Sept of 2017. Come Feb/March 2018 she starts acting a bit weird. and in early march she told me she did not love me anymore. She moved out a couple days later. I tried to save our marriage. I suggested marriage counseling, trying to find that spark again by dating, etc. But she never wanted to try to save our marriage. She started mentioning that she wanted a divorce around the summer time. She always wanted to hang out with me still. We would go out to eat, go to the movies, fool around even. But she did not want to try and be in our marriage. She later told me that she was talking(at the time as a friend or so she says) to a coworker from work. She then told me she developed feelings for him. About a month ago she told me those feelings were gone. I dont know if she lost feelings for me because of this other guy or if it has nothing to do with her losing feelings for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Its now almost October and she hasnt filed but is very set in her ways of wanting a divorce still. I tried everything I could think of and nothing has worked so I told her if you want to file file. I have given up. I am drained. I love her still to this day. But I'm putting everything I have and Im tired. I told her today pretty much the exact thing and that I couldnt do this anymore and wish her farewell.

&amp;#x200B;

All of this happened with a newborn, who turns 1 in a little over a week. I don't know how we went from madly in love to her saying she didnt love me anymore so fast. I truly dont understand how someone can give up on a marriage and a family without trying(at least thats how it looks in my eyes).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm heartbroken as many of the people on this subreddit are. It feels good to get it all out there though. 

We ran together. 5Ks/10Ks/Half marathons, we lost weight together, we worked in the same school district. We just had a baby. I thought we were building up our future. We even had put down a deposit/earnest money for a house in Nov/Dec 2017. And now 6 months of being seperated of her not wanting me despite what her body language was saying in that time frame. I feel like I am being used. But today I stood up and told myself I was done. I hope the future has better things in store for me."

Met this girl at my gym, fucked her within a week. Turned beta and she stopped talking to me/showing up to the gym due to internship. 

Fast forward 6 months. See her at gym again. She tells me about how she’s seeing this one guy and implying she’s still cheating on her bf. I hold frame and after 2 months we fuck again. 

She starts being distant after we fuck and the last time we fucked she was barely putting out so i had to work really hard during foreplay. She said we arent sexually compatible.

Now i asked her to hangout tomorrow and she was giving me bs excuses about how she’s on her period and bullshit like that. I was really high when texting her, and we had made plans to smoke weed together the next day and i said smoking will make you feel better. She says “ok ill see”, and i still insisted that she came, and she just tells me she asked her boyfriend and he said no. I tell her “oh you ask him now huh?” and she says “i always did”. Told her “what about that other guy” she tells me “i ask him too.... sometimes” then i say “so ask for me sometimes too” and she says “i’m asking all the time now, no exception”.

What should i do now? Should i just next her? I was thinking about calling her and asking her to meetup so we could talk. Maybe i should tell her that i wasnt trying to smash and we should just stay friends and i was being too persistent because i was too high. 

What should i do?"
9an1a0,3,2018-08-27,I'm graduating college in a few months and I hated almost every second of it.,3amandstillsober,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/9an1a0/im_graduating_college_in_a_few_months_and_i_hated/,"It took me almost six fucking years to graduate, but I'm finally almost out of the system.

My time in college was not fun. I was not mentally ready to go and it took me three years to get my shit together. Over the following three years I've transformed from a deadbeat, emotionally impressionable kid who doesn't know what the hell he's doing with his life into a bitter, elitist piece of shit who has something to prove to make up for wasted youth who also doesn't know what the hell he's doing with his life.

I don't think I've made many serious bonds with people at all. Honestly although I've grown very distant from my high school friends who I literally talk to once a month and I still feel closer to them than anyone I've met in college.

The only productive things I've done were from about the beginning of august 2017 to now. LITERALLY everything on my resume or that I'm proud has happened in that timeframe.

One year. Exactly one year of my life was worth living. The other 22 were just a waste of time. Nothing of worth happened then. I've burned my entire youth and now there's nothing for me to prove. No matter what I accomplish in life it doesn't fucking matter cause I couldn't do it right the first time around. I still have the same childish hobbies and interests as I've always had and I feel really out of place whenever I indulge in them.

Hell, when I apply for a job it's not unreasonable to assume my interviewer will be younger than me.

Some would say I should appreciate that I have this opportunity to be in an environment of learning, but it's also an environment of competition. You are graded with respect to your peers, your peers will apply to the same jobs and internships as you will, and only a few of you will beat out the others. After every test or assignment you'll know exactly how many people did better than you. Grading schemas are so unclear that you literally don't know how the fuck you're graded until the curve settles at the end and the top 10-15% get their A.

Granted GPA only matters as long as you're above 3.3 in my field. I'm a 3.31 lol so I guess I just made it, but boy does it hurt knowing that not only did I take six years to graduate, I couldn't even do it well.

Can't even stop caring. Wanna finish out strong and I have to look for a job as well. Everything leading up to this semester has been causing me to lose a lot of sleep over the last few months.

I'm 6 years into college. People who I graduated high school with are out of the system and moving on with their lives already. Accepting my mediocrity is a part of life, and knowing that almost everyone that I grew up with has surpassed me and that I'll never catch up stings, but I'll have to either get over it or kill myself because the stress is driving me nuts.

I'm watching everyone I've grown up with continue to do so. Marriage, kids, graduation, moving out, paying rent, paying loans, buying stock, starting law school, starting med school, starting grad school, starting your career, starting your business, getting employed, getting deployed, having your parents die, watching your siblings move away for college, watching your siblings come back from college, the list just goes on and on and it's as if the universe is trying to drop the hardest, most obvious signal  that the coming of age for my generation is about to end, and all I can do is watch it from the sidelines, still in fucking school. At this age, it seems that life just kind of moves in these crazy bursts and I'm the guy who was left behind, who couldn't make it.

Hah, I have my first class later today. Might go in hungover or something."

I’ll have a tl;dr at the end.

So, my best friends sister (23f) has become one of my closets friends. Known her since we were in middle school, and from 13-20 we were just friends.

Then, about a month apart, we both went through terrible breakups and ended up confiding in each other. Mine ended when my then gf wanted me to spend less time with my father (dying of cancer) and more time with her family, Her’s ended when Her bf wanted to branch out in college and ended up sleeping with another girl, without telling her.

That was when we were 21 and 20, and after we found ourselves to be kindred spirits, we ended up talking more through texts and Snapchat. She was still in college and I was working 60 hours a week, so we never got the chance to see each other, but every time she came home it was like she never left. For the first year or so, that’s how it went.

Then, two winters ago, both still single, she came home for Christmas and tagged along as me and her brother went bar hopping. Night went as expected until I brought them both home (I was DD) and she let it slip that that night was the first time in a long time she was happy. Being honest, I told her I was always happier when she was around, and she was one of the only people since my breakup to make me feel that way. The Goodnight hug lasted for what seemed like forever, her arms under my armpits and mine around her shoulders, and I went home.

I didn’t really think anything of it until she went back to college and we slowly stopped talking. By that summer it was like she was a stranger. Also during that time I basically became a member of the family. (my dad had passed, my brother moved away and my mom is a bit of a home body, so I hung out with them a lot) Over that next summer, we hung out more and more, at first with her brothers, then more and more just the two of us, eventually I got roped into helping her move back. We all had dinner at a nearby restaurant, and as I was leaving (me and her brother had to get the rented trailer back quickly) she got up, rushed around the table and hugged me, much the same way she had in the above paragraph, but in front of most of her family, and told me not to be a stranger. Me and her brother left, and while I tried to keep in touch, she once again slowly talked less and less, and it more or less repeated itself the next winter.

Ended up going to New Years with her family, which is a several day long stay at a small hotel where we basically party and eat for the entire time, and she acted strange. At first, avoided me. Then later was all over me in the pool (roughhousing with me and Her brothers/cousins, nothing kinky, though she jumped on my back a lot and such) then once we got out, back to not really talking to me. Cycle repeated every day until New Year’s Day, when she and her brothers ended up in my room for a few hours, trying to avoid the loudness of the main area. I was laying at the foot of the bed, she was sitting up at the headboard. She eventually slid down and used me as a foot rest. I was too tired and hung over to do anything about it, so I just let it happen. As we were about to leave, she once again gave me a long, tight hug and told me she missed me. I just snorted and hugged back, saying I missed her too and to keep in touch.

Rinse, repeat, barely talked until summer.

Then, this summer happened. First, I had a house warming party in May, where she was obviously invited and surprisingly made it, but while she was there, she always stayed close to me (even though her brothers were both there, as one is renting a room from me) and I later learned she gave both my female cousin and my buddies fiancé ‘the up down look’ every time that they were closer to me than she was. I didn’t know any of this was happening. As I finally got a chance to sit down, she came up behind me, hugged me around the neck and chest and told me she was heading back and how much she missed me. I half jokingly replied “if you missed me so much, you would respond to my texts.” She was put off by that, and surprise surprise, we barely talked until i went with her family to help her move again.

She stayed in the college town to work an internship, and only came home for about two weeks at the end of the summer. Since she’s switching houses, we had to pack her shit up and bring it home for the time she’s home. 

I had mentioned to her brother I needed new clothes, and she ended up overhearing me. She always knew what was in style and such, so I asked her if she would go with and make sure I didn’t buy a bunch of shit that I shouldn’t.

She was ecstatic. Like super happy. I go to pick her up, and the second she’s in my car I smell perfume. She almost never wears perfume unless it’s on a date. I just figure since we are going to the mall, she wanted to look her best. As per every time I shop with a woman, I let her pick clothes first. It’s the least I can do, she’s taking time out of her day. She ended up trying a few shits on and even asked my opinion on a few. We ended up having a great time, made each other laugh a bunch, got some great deals, she dragged me into Victoria’s Secret, didn’t find anything she liked, asked what I liked, I pointed it out, she couldn’t find one in her size. Ended up going into another store where she brought two bras and told me not to tell her mother. No problem, Her mom scares me. 

She asked if we could get some Ice cream, so we did, and while we were eating it, she let it slip that she hadn’t been as happy as she was then in a long time. I just smiled and told her that she always seemed to brighten up my day. I brought her home, dropped her off and went home. I texted Her thanking her again and she thanked me for taking her shopping and I and thanked her for being such a good friend. 

Then I got a call from her brother the next morning asking what I did to make her sad, as she had moped around the house all that night and most of the next morning, I just said that she seemed super happy when I dropped her off.

As you can tell, I’m not the greatest at reading women, and with my past I dont like taking chances, can any of you tell me what the hell is going on here? For the longest time I thought I was just her crutch to get over her ex, then I thought she actually like-liked me, then I was pretty sure we were just friends, but now I just have no clue. 

Tl;dr

Friends sister became one of my best friends, but grows distant each time we don’t physically see each other for long periods of time, then almost instantly reverts back to best friend when she see each other, always long hugs and says she misses me. The hell is going on?"

Struggle to get my licence and fail the written test 5 times before going into fail the road test four times. Which makes it impossible to get a job.

Messed up friendship because last December I threw a mouse at a friend in a moment of rage. Cue deep dive back into depression as I wonder if I'll not only become my parents but be worse.

The mods work hard to keep the community active there is a weekly thread called ""The (Not So) Daily Planet!"" where they discuss the weeks comics, Tv and Film. As someone that can't always keep up with the weeks newist  issues its really cool to be able to read this thread and get a feel for it so I can check it out at a later date. They also showcase a weekly rewatch thread for Superman: The Animated Series where a dedicated user posts the synopsis as well some other pertinent information.

Its always a pleasant time visiting /r/Superman, the sub the community is really open to new users and from my experience just want to help if someone has something they would like to know about the character. As a huge fan of the films I always check the sub to see if there is any news on the Man of Steel sequel, no luck yet but when there is news I can guarantee they'll have it as soon as it breaks!

&gt;#What is your favorite thing about Superman?  

&gt;&gt;**u/MajorParadox**  I love how he's someone who not only saves people but works as an example to strive for. A message that he tends to get across is ""powers or not, everyone is a superhero if they do what they can to help.""

&gt;&gt;**u/jmoriarty**  His humanity. With his powers he could take over, become a tyrant, get whatever he wanted... but he won't. His sense of morality and compassion are too strong, and he holds himself to the highest of standards. That in turn makes him an inspiration for both other heroes and regular people.

&gt;&gt;**u/ZacPensol**  He embodies a hopeful escapist fantasy that I think we can all benefit from in life. The idea that this nearly all-powerful guy would choose to use his abilities for the good of mankind rather than personal gain is particularly inspirational to me, both in how I conduct myself and in how I try to see the world.

&gt;&gt;**u/jmoriarty**  I love Superman stories, but also how other people react to him. And of course I love find out about cool Supes swag. It's a good place to talk about the character with other people who are as passionate about him as I am.

&gt;&gt;**u/ZacPensol**  I first started coming around pretty much as soon as I joined Reddit because I love Superman, though that was right around when 'Man of Steel' came out and the comics' New 52 relaunch was in full swing (neither of which did I particularly care for) and so I didn't participate in conversation a whole lot. Eventually though it started making for interesting discussions with people of different opinions. When applications opened up for new mods I threw in my hat because I'd come to really enjoy the friendly community and wanted to do what I could to help maintain and strengthen it.

&gt;##Anything else you want to add?

&gt;&gt;**u/MajorParadox**  I write Superman over on r/DCFU so check it out and let me know what you think!

&gt;&gt;**u/jmoriarty**  Once upon a time Superman wasn't the dark, gritty character we've seen in movies, but a source of inspiration. He's someone to look up to not because he is a ""boy scout"", but because he challenges us to be better and believes in us to achieve it. I'm hoping that once again we reach a point where that's the sort of hero we really need.

9aoy3y,1,2018-08-27,[US] [Investing] [Planning] How to leave parents financial adviser and what should I do with the money,finance_throwaway_0,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9aoy3y/us_investing_planning_how_to_leave_parents/,"Hi /r/personalfinance 

I'm very lucky to have a significant amount of money in accounts from my parents. They operate these accounts through a financial adviser. 

There are two accounts - a 529 plan with enough money to pay for the rest of my college tuition, and about $350k in a trust which will unlock when I am 21 (I'm currently over 18 but not 21). I also have about $10k in a high yield savings accounts. And... let's face it, I have half a million in trust funds, if I were to run into some financial disaster such as an extreme medical injury, I would likely be able to get assistance paying for it, so a massive emergency fund isn't critical.

In terms of tax-advantaged accounts, I am currently setting up a Roth IRA. I've completed an internship that will allow me to contribute the $5,500 and will likely be able to max it out each year until graduation with more internships, but I doubt I will have a 401k at any of these internships.

The financial adviser charges an annual fee of 1% of assets under management. I think it would be beneficial for me to manage my assets myself and avoid this fee, but I feel a little uncomfortable handling that much money by myself. They currently have a pretty diverse portfolio with domestic and global equity and debt

The 529 plan doesn't need much planning as it will be approximately empty by the time I graduate college, but I don't know what to do with the other money. I don't think I will make a large purchase (like a down payment on a house) in the short/medium term so I'm OK with a riskier portfolio.

Would it make sense to put this money entirely into domestic equity?  Just stick all $350k into VTI, or maybe keep another $20k in savings?

Note: I understand that I can't do anything with this money right now, but my parents would sign off if I'm adequately prepared or if not I can do this when I'm 21

**tl;dr: have 350k in trust with a financial advisor with a 1% fee, should I take it out / what should I do with it**"
9aoyk2,1,2018-08-27,[A4A] Literate Fandom Romance Plots,Coffeeandcatsrp,Roleplaykik,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplaykik/comments/9aoyk2/a4a_literate_fandom_romance_plots/,"Hey all! I am still on the hunt to do a literate fandom romance rp. Below are a few plot ideas, but I'm open to any you may have! (Note: These are Canon x OC, with you playing the canon role)

New Royal Crush (M x F or M x M)

Bowser x OC Bowser grew tired of chasing Princess Peach. He knew she didn't feel the same way he did. So he decided to pursue a new person...

This can be kidnapping, or maybe Bowser shows a sweet side. Up to you!

Not for Long (M x M)

Wallace Wells x OC (Scott Pilgrim Rp) When Scott brings over his new friend from work, Wallace outs on his usual moves. His best friend telling him the cute boy is straight won't stop him...

The Lab Intern (M x F or M x M) Professor Birch x OC (Pokemon) When Professor Birch was told he would get a new intern, he wasn't expecting someone so cute. As his feelings grow by the day, what will he do?

SHE/HE'S MINE! (M x F or M x M) BTR guys x OC (Big Time Rush) After a new up and coming artist moves into the Palm Woods, the guys go crazy for them (except for Kendall). Who will this new artist choose?

This is a love rivalry plot.

New to the Force (M x M) The Ginyu Force x OC (Dragon Ball Z) After Guildo left, the Ginyu force hired a new member- but weren't expecting someone so adorable and begin fighting over him. What will he do?

This is a love rivalry plot.

Game on, dude! (M x F or M x M) Bastion, Chumley and Hassleberry x OC (Yugioh GX) After a new student moved to Duel Academy, the guys couldn't resist them. Who will the newbie go for?

I will play pretty much all other characters in this, and it's a love rivalry.

Colors (M x M) Beast Boy x OC (Teen Titans) Beast Boy never thought he would love again. Until a cute boy joined their team... Wait, did he like guys? How will he deal with his feelings as they grow stronger?

Moving on (M x F or M x M) Tom x OC (Star vs the forces of evil After getting dumped by Star for Marco, Tom never thought he'd love again... Until someone new comes into his sights...

If none of these strike your fancy, feel free to give me your ideas/fandoms! Other fandoms I enjoy but don't have a specific plot for: Adventure Time, Avatar the last airbender, Disney, Inuyasha, Left 4 Dead, Legend of Korra, Total Drama

⭐⭐ Here are my rules:

1. Please be literate. No text talk or bad grammar (minus the occasional slip up of course).

2. I only rp in 3rd person. This is non-negotiable. Please be okay doing 3rd.

3. I ONLY PLAY UKE/SUB, NEVER DOM!!!! MY CHARACTERS ARE SUBS ONLY!!!! You have been warned!!!!

4. Be okay with OC x canon

5. Please be an active role player overall. We all have lives but please don't just disappear for days on end and never return.

6. If you are looking for all smut, you have come to the wrong place. I am fine with a build up to smut, but I want there to be a focus on romance and plot.

7. Please be respectful of me. I am a very friendly person but the quickest way to end an rp with me is to treat me badly. I am a human that deserves dignity like everyone else. Insult me once and it's over.

8. I'm sorry, but if your profile pic has a real person in it, I would ask that you change it before rping. It really just throws me off as weird as that sounds (anime/cartoon pics, scenery and anything else really are fine).

9. I usually do written bios, but if you HAVE to have pictures, I only do anime/cartoon refs and will only accept the same. NO REAL LIFE PICS PLEASE!!!

I am fine with people of all gender expressions, as long as you play M! My timezone is EST US time. All characters will be 18+. I am working most of today but I will reply as soon as possible.

I think that's it? If interested, kik:

Hope to rp soon!

I have Bipolar 2. Diagnosed 3 years ago. Recently I have been feeling frustrated at how little others know about Bipolar and the stigma it carries. I go to support groups and have my parents sister and some good friends to talk to when I need to and I feel lucky. But they have and can’t always be there for various reasons. It made me think of those who don’t count with this support. I know I’ve felt many times like an outsider and misunderstood and judged. I’ve seen some friends open up about having depression and stuff on Facebook and I honestly want to do the same. I want to openly tell people about it to hopefully help take that stigma down and inspire others. I have learned to not let Bipolar define me or stop me. I go to college and I keep a pretty good GPA (engineering student!) I’ve gotten more than 5 internships under my belt and I have succeeded greatly at them (not trying to show off here, just want to bring it up because it’s been hard work but it can be done). 

I guess my question is, have you guys ever done this? I have co workers close friends and random people I’ve met I. School on my social media. I understand not everyone will get it, but what would be the best way to come out about it ? Also, anyone recommend some Instagram accounts, blogs or anything like that of young people living with Bipolar ? 

Thank you all!!"

Got a little carried away with this intro, but I’m looking for someone to play this out with me either as Darius, my dad, or both (if you don’t want to play both, I’ll play the other person). PLEASE READ TO THE END! I have no limits except for poor spelling/grammar, and short replies. The fewer limits you have, the better! I want things to get really fucked up ;) 

——————————————————-

**BANG BANG BANG BANG**

My father lied in his bed, exhausted but unable to sleep over the loud sounds coming from his door. All he could do was watch the door shake violently in rhythm, looking ready to break right off its hinges at any moment. 

Just on the other side of his door were two  people my father knew quite well. There was me, his teenage daughter, my face and overdeveloped chest being slammed against the door again and again. And there was Darius, the absolute bane of my poor father’s existence. 

Ever since they met in middle school, Darius had gone out of his way to make every day of my dad’s life a living nightmare. His family is incredibly wealthy and powerful, so he’s never once had to experience any sort of repercussions for his actions. Darius would beat him so badly he had to be hospitalized regularly. And that was nothing compared to the psychological and emotional torture he put him through. There was the time my father actually managed to get a girlfriend...until Darius tied him to a chair and fucked her with his enormous horse cock right in front of him. Or when my grandmother - a gorgeous, sexy MILF at the time - finally tried to stand up for my father, and Darius wound up fucking her, taking a picture with his cock resting next to her cum covered face, on top of what was clearly your pillow from your bed, then printed out copies and put them up all over school. The locker rooms were torture of course, especially since my father has a medically diagnosed condition called “baby penis syndrome”, meaning his penis never grew since birth. Hence his nickname, “Baby Dick”, that stuck with him all throughout school. Darius even had the teachers calling him that when he used his father’s power to change his name in the school’s system. 

My father somehow survived these years of torture, and moved as far away as he could to go to college. Miraculously, he actually managed to get a girl to let him have sex with her, and although she laughed when he dropped his pants and he came the moment his dick touched her pussy, she got pregnant with me. She wanted nothing to do with me, and he was given full custody. He managed to get a decent paying job in a generic corporate office as an accountant, and while we didn’t have much, we were still getting by and very close. 

That was until Darius turned up in his life yet again. 

He waltzed into my father’s office building one day, and somehow - just like in high school - Darius always got just what he wanted, and by that afternoon, somehow Darius had become my father’s boss. He was immediately given a pay cut, in fact being declared an unpaid intern. His workload however, increased 10 fold. From scrubbing toilets to doing paperwork for everyone in the office, he was running around all day for pennies. 

But at least he still had me, his little honeybee. That’s what he kept telling himself as his nightmare returned with you entering his life again. That made it all the worse when he came home after cleaning the office after hours again one night to find Darius in the kitchen, me lying naked on my back on the table, trying to moan but unable as Darius’ huge hands are wrapped tight around my throat while he drives his cock in and out of my tight little pussy. He just grinned, released one hand off my throat so he could flip my father the bird, and slammed forward one final time before he dumped his huge load inside me. 

Fast forward a few weeks, and I was now “dating” Darius, though really he just fucks me in depraved, rough, nasty ways all over the house and the office day and night, and it brings us to now. 

**”LISTEN TO THE SOUND OF ME DESTROYING YOUR DUMB FUCKING BITCH OF A DAUGHTER YOU FUCKING LOSER!!”** Darius roared as he grabbed a fistful of my hair, pulling on it hard like reins as he fucked my ass raw as hard as he could, taunting my father the whole time. **”TELL HIM, WHORE! TELL HIM YOU LOVE MY COCK MORE THAN HIM!”**

“I love your big monster cock daddy!” I cried out between my moans and grunts. Darius made it very clear I was to call him daddy, especially around my father. “Mmm I love it so much more than anything or anyone, especially my loser old dad!”

9aq8br,3,2018-08-27,Advice for picking a date... a little complicated,alphabetmoose,weddingplanning,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/9aq8br/advice_for_picking_a_date_a_little_complicated/,"Hello weddit!

I need your help. I just picked a date at a venue that I love for September 8th 2019. I found out from my future brother in law's wife that she would probably not be able to make the wedding because she will be taking FMLA April through July. She is a school teacher and thinks she's going to get serious repercussions for asking to take time off for a wedding right after taking FMLA. Thus if she can't make it to the wedding should I try to talk to my venue about getting a different date that she can do late June? I'm afraid of starting a family feud because I pick a date that she cant go to. 


June 2019 seems so close and is stressing me out, mid july to august gets too hot for an outdoor wedding.... i cant even guarentee that the venue has dates in June-July anymore. Then we started talking about June 2020 and realized my sister graduates college mid June 2020 and that just seems stressful to coordinate a wedding just after celebrating a graduation.

I just dont know what to do. I am just so sad about this whole situation.

Any insight would be incredibly helpful. Thank you.

Edit: We are having our wedding where we live on the west coast. A lot of our family is from out of town and will have to travel to us. For everyone but us, it is a destination wedding. For my future husbands sister in law she lives on th east coast. So she would have to take a day off to travel to the wedding.

Edit 2: We talked to my FH father today and got a little more insight. So, some other details.
- She is just in her second year of teaching for this school. 
- She is trying to get tenure, which she gets after the third year of school
- She is afraid that by taking FMLA in her second year of teaching and then asking for one day off in the first few weeks of school will put a mark against her for getting tenure.
- Teachers- Any thoughts?

Edit 3: Good news! My venue has a lot of dates open in June. Bad news- My sister said that she is applying for her dream internship in Japan and that June wouldn't work. I am reaching back out at her to get actual dates


Thank you all!"

This was not my first relationship, my prior one was about 19 months which I ended but this time round I was dumped out of the blue and afterwards we spoke a bit, then less than a bit, and now we never talk.

I'm not sure why I've struggled so much. I am busy with my work life, my internship ends soon and I am back to University but everyday I find myself thinking about this person. The smallest things set me off, from someone with similar tattoos to someone with the same accent, I genuinely don't know why they have this hold over me, 3 months after they broke up with me.

We are now no contact. I haven't heard from them in over a month when I last tried to talk to them about how I felt regarding our friendship and they blanked all my messages. They also began seeing someone else 3 weeks after we broke up, so I feel that probably has something to do with it.

Anyone who's had experiences similar to this or who has advice on how I can help myself would be doing me a massive favour! We weren't together long, but it was a very exciting and fulfilling relationship and probably the first time I would say I had fallen in love with someone properly. I even slept with someone else and felt sad when I woke up because I wanted to be next to my ex, it's getting ridiculous. They're the first thing I think of as soon as I wake up and the last thing I usually think of when I go to sleep.

When will this nightmare end 😅"
9aqz14,1,2018-08-27,"NNC: Corbynn's Lament, continued",TheActionEconomist,TheCTeam,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCTeam/comments/9aqz14/nnc_corbynns_lament_continued/,"and here's the rest. 

&amp;#x200B;

 

""Shucks Corbynn.  I ain't never been as sorry as I am now about this.""

Moarg was trembling.  It was clear he didn't want to be having this conversation, or any other like it. Corbynn towered over him, unrelenting.  ""Well, that's a relief,""  Corynn said.  ""I'd hate to think you're conscience was weighing you down all these years.""

The Sahuagin had rounded up the crew on the upper deck and stowed them in the cargo hold.  Iron wrought cages, typically used by team Naiad to house miscreants and hooligans they caught for bounty, separated the crew of the ship from Corbynn and Doldroma.  Surprisingly, the Sea Devils allowed travel from one cage to the other, as long they were under heavy surveillance.  It was how Moarg would come to be in the cage with Corbynn now, digging his toenail into the floorboards.

""If it was up to me,"" He said ""we'd be ending this strike right directly, But the boys, they're...dangit, Patches done found tha werd fer it..Disgruntled! That's it!""

Corbynn raised a weary eyebrow.  ""Disgruntled huh? Interesting.  Could they maybe, hear me out, suspend the mutiny until, I don't know, our lives aren't threatened by a bunch of murderous fish people?""

""Oh, it ain't a mutiny Corbynn.  It's a strike.""

Corbynn ran his hands through his hair.  ""What does that have to with the price of whores in Luskan?""  Moarg hastily shook his head.  ""No, see I...what?... no, see, if it was a mutiny, then that means it would be against you, and we ain't against you.  We's against that Almond Drain feller back in Waterdeep.""

Corbynn's shoulders sagged. ""Welp, at least I can get behind that, Moarg.""  He lead the Tortle to the cage door and the Sahuagin guard took him back to the crew.

He turned to face Doldroma and sighed.  After the magics that held her and Fenn had worn off, the Sahuagin were smart enough to tie up her arms and legs to prevent her from casting.  They attempted to gag her as well, but Corbynn, miracle of miracles, was able to convince them that as long as her hands were bound, she was harmless.  It was only until afterward that he, unfortunately, found out that was true, mostly. ""I'm wearing em down,"" he said.  ""Another couple of months and they'll come to the bargaining table.""  Doldroma sniffed the air and chuckled. ""Such a shrewd negotiator.""

He plopped himself down next to her and arched his back.  The day had already taken a mighty toll on him and it wasn't even half done yet. ""The Sahuagin think we're part of the trading fleet,"" he said ""so they're trying to ransom us off to Neverwinter.  Once they figure out that we were sent to kill them, We're done for in a terrible way.""  He glanced at Doldroma, dejected ""I am officially out of ideas."" ""Well, don't feel too bad,"" she said.  ""You didn't have that many ideas to begin with.""  Corbynn seemed to melt onto the grain bags he was sitting on ""Really?  This is what I need right now?""  Doldroma shrugged, hindered by the ropes that held her. ""Look at me Corbynn"" she said.  ""Sarcasm is all I have left.""

Corbynn paced in the cage.  Further, in the cargo hold, he could see Fenn.  She had made at least three escape attempts that he knew of since the Endless Maw had captured them.  A couple of them were even close to successful. Fenn would argue even the third was deceptively cunning enough to warrant inclusion in that category.  The end result of which was that she was buried under a mountain of rope and restraints until only her head was visible.  The Sahuagin had erected a makeshift barricade out of unused crates to pen her in and had no less than six guards with tridents trained in her direction, ever vigilant.  Even from this distance, he could see in her eyes that escape attempt number four was currently being calculated, but he didn't hold out much hope that it would materialize in time.  

""I do have one suggestion,"" Doldroma offered ""but you're not gonna like it.""  ""Then I hate it already,"" Corbynn said.  She shifted her weight slightly, as much as her restraints would allow.  Glancing at the guards to make sure they didn't notice, she gestured with her chin to her documancy bag. ""My ledger's still in there.  I can't reach it, but you could, and then you-""

""No!

""It's just-""

""No! I don’t want them all up in our business!”

“It’s their business too.”

“ I'm not writing to the home office with my tail between my legs! ""

""Technically, it's your job to do that.""

""Then I'm on strike too!""

Corbynn sat down gruffly.  He attempted to make it seem like it wasn't in a huff, but it's resemblance to a schoolboys tantrum was self-evident.  Doldroma leaned in and spoke directly in Corbynn's ear. ""Look, I know what happens on this ship without me""  She whispered.  ""When you have to stow the AI sails and unfurl ones that are more...discreet?"" 

Corbynn looked momentarily shocked, but a thin smile emerged on his lips.  ""I tried to give you plausible deniability on that,"" He said.   He knew she was too clever to try and play innocent.  ""That's kind of you dear, but it's not very plausible if I know all about it,"" she said. ""Anyways, if you're worried about the home office getting wind of your extracurricular excursions,  I can assure you-""

""No, no, that's not it.  Well, that's not entirely it.""  He shook his head defiantly and turned to face her.   ""Look, I was a freebooter before I could actually walk in boots.  I've sailed every mile of these seas at least a dozen times, and I've never had to answer to anyone or anything save my crew or my captain.  But I'd never sat in the chair until the Merry Widow.  Never held that wheel knowing it steered no one's course but my own.   And what I had to promise to that bald bastard to get it… well, I'm just as much a slave now as the crew is.  I've been operating under the assumption that this boat is mine, no matter whose colors it flies.  And every time we defer to the home office, it reminds me that that's a lie.""

Doldroma sat quietly for a long moment, while Corbynn wallowed in his own pity.  ""So, I don't know if you've noticed, Corbynn,"" she finally said ""but I'm Dragonborn.  Now, that means a lot of things, but for the purposes of this discussion, it means that I know a thing or two about pride.  And it's been my experience that, in MOST cases, having an abundance of pride is to your advantage.  The trick is in knowing when it isn't.""

Corbynn looked down at his hands for a long while, then dug into the documancy bag and pulled out the ledger.  Grabbing a quill and ink, he took a deep breath, and began to write.  "" Have experienced complications regarding current mission.  Targets have taken over the boat and taken crew and team hostage.  Please advise."" After a pregnant moment, the familiar scratching returned and read "" Solution pending.  Hang in there.""

Corbynn stifled a laugh and shook his head.  He turned the ledger to show Doldroma.  ""Guess it's a moot point now.  They're just as flummoxed as we are.""  Doldroma leaned her head against the iron cage and stared at the doors to the cargo hold.  "" You know Corbynn, this may not be the time for this either, but, you do realize that if we had a fourth member of the team, we might not be in this situation right now.  I mean, I'm not Fenn, but even I think the numbers would be more in our favor at that point.""

Corbynn's eyes widened to giant moons, as the realization took hold of him.  He grabbed her by the shoulders and shook.  She went dizzy.  ""Oh gods, Doldroma!  You're magnificent!  I really could plant a big old kiss on that beak of yours!"" He began rooting through her documancy bag.  "" Please don't,"" she said.  ""Your hair, it's…what are you doing?""

""I have an idea, but you're not going to like it.""

She sat up, pole straight. ""Then I hate it already.""

""You and I are going to write up some Documancy"" he said.  The glee pouring off of his face was palpable.

Doldroma leaned back, slightly frightened ""What kind of Documancy?""

""The kind that Almond Drain is gonna hate.""

\*\*\*

Moarg held the two sheets of parchment in his hands.  He surveyed one, before turning it upside down, but the mask of confusion affixed to his face never fell.  From deeper within the bowels of the cargo hold, Corbynn could just about make out the rest of the crew, their shadow, an amorphous mass that leaned heavily against their cage.  ""Corbynn, I done told you I ain't so good with ma letters,"" Moarg moaned  ""specially when they's written up in these fancy curly q's you got here"" he handed the two sheets back to Corbynn, who snatched them from his hands and leaned in, conspiratorially.  ""It's like this, Moarg.  What you and the boys have been doing is called collective bargaining.  Do you know what collective bargaining is?""

The Tortle scratched his bald head, as a hazy understanding seemed to coalesce.  ""Is it like when no one wants to pay fer the next round at tha staggers n jags, so I says ‘everybody pays for they own gods dang ale', but then some bastard says ‘nah, fuck that.  First one what takes a piss pays the next' and then everybody agrees?  Cause I can't hold ma piss for nuthin, Corbynn, I hate that game.""

Corbynn attempted comprehension and failed. ""Okay, um, no"" he finally said.  ""Collective bargaining is when you get together as a group and ask for something that you can't get individually.""

""Ooohhhh.""  Corbynn knew he would convince the Tortle eventually.  It was just going to take a while to pierce the layers of ignorance Moarg's simple life had accumulated.

""Right, and a group that does that is called a union.""  Corbynn pointed to each individual parchment in turn  ""Now this contract officially unionizes the crew, and THIS contract makes the union the fourth member of Team Naiad.""

Moarg stared off into the distance, wide-eyed. ""The fourth member?"" he said.

Corbynn clapped him on the shell.  ""That's right.  You boys'll be in on all the decisions we make, and, the best part, you all get a cut of the profits.""

Moarg glanced at Doldroma, whose face seemed like a melange of defeat and faint disgust.  He leaned in closer to Corbynn and whispered: ""Does that include the illegal profits, Corbynn?""

""Especially the Illegal profits, Moarg.""  Corbynn nodded, and Moarg grabbed the contracts from out of his hands.  ""Hot dang! Where do I sign?""

""Well, we don't have time to draw up contracts for everyone,"" Corbynn said "" but you take these two back to show the crew, and tell them I promise when we get back to shore, Doldroma and I will make contracts for every member of the crew.  You think you can convince them to stop the mutiny with this?""

""It's a strike.""

""Whatever.""

""Shit, yeah I can."" Moarg's enthusiasm infused a spring in his step that Corbynn hadn't seen all day.   ""Good. How long will it take for you all to bust out of that cage?"" 

Moarg beamed assuredly.  "" oh, we's most a tha way there already.  We just need a signal.  What is tha signal, anyhow?""

""You'll know moarg""

""oh, right.""

Moarg practically skipped away.  He wasn't sure whether or not the Tortle would convince the others to follow along.  Because of the distance between him and his crew, however, he had to proceed under the notion that they would be there when needed.

And anyway, Corbynn knew he had bigger metaphorical AND literal fish to fry.  Namely, his current team members.  Doldroma's position on the matter was clear, and he knew Fenn would equally question the unconventional solution.  If they realized the truth, that the crew, wrapped around his little finger as they were, would almost always vote any way Corbynn told them to, the two ladies would surely protest.

Turning his attention to his cellmate, it seemed as if she sensed his thoughts. ""I can't believe you made me an accomplice to this farce,"" she said.

Corbynn couldn't resist a self-congratulating smile. ""You were the one that wanted the fourth member."" She snorted. ""Why do I get the feeling you engineered this whole disaster just to force this ridiculous outcome?""  Her stare seemed intent to drill holes into his forehead.  For his part, he tried to play off her concern. ""Come on, Doldroma"" He said, mockingly.  ""If I wanted to tie you up, I could have come up with a lot more charming ways than this.""  Doldroma's face worked its way through a series of emotional responses, as if she had considered the notion of romantic intimacy with Corbynn on a purely intellectual level, and found that it disgusted her just as much as she suspected it would.  ""Keep dreaming, Monkey boy"" She said and sat upright, content to leave the situation as is.   ""What's the next move?""

Corbynn considered his options.  ""Can you get a word or two to Fenn?"" he said.  Doldroma attempted to crane her neck and catch a glimpse of their missing Obviator.  ""I would have to see her.  You're going to have to turn me around.""

Corbynn obliged.  It's impossible to be inconspicuous when lifting and turning a 6'7"" gold-plated Dragonborn, and he was relying on the nearby guards' curiosity getting the better of them.  They didn't disappoint.  Doldroma's face squished against the iron bars, and the two Sahuagin nearby immediately exchanged glances.  Apparently writing up contracts and having animated conversations with a giant tortoise person doesn't arouse suspicion, mostly because it would be difficult to conceive the danger in it, but as Doldroma whispered through the bars, they slowly advanced to her position, unsure of how to proceed.  

When her magic whisper reached Fenn's ear, Corbynn could see the Genasi's eyes open wide with recognition for a moment.  She was still gagged, but what Doldroma said to her elicited a nod. ""Okay, now what?""  Doldroma said.  Corbynn cracked his back.  The two suspicious guards leaned in and inspected her face.  He knew they were a few precious seconds away from barging into the cage. ""Remember that thing I told you never to do on my boat?""  He said.  Doldroma smiled.

The rest occurred almost without words.  The two guards came close.  She belched a gout of white-hot flame in their faces.  In-human screams erupted from their burning lips.  The six guards watching Fenn turned their attention to the commotion, all the time she needed.  Fenn shifted her weight within the restraints and disappeared.  Two of the six ran in the direction of Corbynn and Doldroma's cage.  The other four immediately began peeling layers of rope and leather straps from Fenn's now empty prison.  

They saw it too late.  A false floor, a hidden compartment underneath the cargo hold.  They peered in, and four daggers flashed in the darkness, each sheathing itself in a sahuagin throat.  An acidic wisp of smoke escaped their mouths and they clattered to the floor.

The remaining two were almost on the cage now.  Fenn sprung up from the hole and ran towards them like a bullet.  She pulled the two revolvers she had hidden...somewhere…and threw them in the air.  ""Corbynn!""  She yelled.

Corbynn was fumbling with Doldroma's restraints when the guards reached the cage door and rattled it open.  The two revolvers sailed in the air.  Corbynn leaned against Doldroma to face the guards.  He held his hands out, caught the guns without looking, and lowered them to eye level as they approached.  Two shots echoed through the cargo hold.  Two smoking holes in the sahuagin foreheads.  They dropped.

From the other side could be heard a ruckus.  Moarg shouted ""ALRIGHT BOYS! LET'S DO THIS!""  A triumphant cheer came as the response.  Corbynn and Fenn untied Doldroma and helped her to her feet.  ""Alright, ladies.  Let's take our girl back"" he said, and took the stairs to the upper deck, two at a time.

\*\*\*

To say they took the sea devils by surprise was an understatement.  The Sahuagin were caught, mid-feast, each with half a writhing fish hanging out of his mouth.  Team naiad arose on one end of the boat, while the crew came from the other.  The Sahuagin were pincered.  The crew members who managed to hide daggers and hatchets on their person took out a handful of guards in a moment.  The ones who were unarmed were immediately handed tridents from the now dead Sea Devils.  Their numbers began dropping rapidly on the deck.  There were others, however, that had been caught frolicking in the water.  In a moment, they would join the fray.

Fenn and Doldroma advanced on the two Sahuagin females.  One fired a brilliant bolt of light in Fenn's direction.  She sidestepped and closed the distance.  A retractable blade emerged from her sleeve.  She gutted the priestess with it and swung up to split her chest in two.  Half-digested fish guts co-mingled with Sahuagin internal organs as she shrieked her death cry. 

Doldroma saw the other priestess casting.  She gestured and stabbed the air with her talons.  The Sahuagin's magic dissipated.  She cried in surprise.  Doldroma took the opening.  She spread her talons in a fan, spoke an incantation, and a sheet of flame burst from her fingertips.  The priestess erupted and fell to her back.  A sliver of the flame singed Fenn's coat and the two team members exchanged glances.  Doldroma grabbed the priestess by the throat and lifted her up, still burning.  She died in her hands, and Doldroma threw her corpse over the boat.  

To his credit, the baron recovered quickly.  Two hands reached for his iridescent lance, while a third grabbed a conch shell, studded with runes, from his belt.  He blew into the conch, and a low, ominous bellow rang out to the sea.  As luck would have it Ba'mu, the giant white torpedo of a shark, was several feet away from the boat when the attack began.  It would take him at least a minute to reach them. 

Corbynn approached him but immediately had to duck from a wild swing.  A fourth hand swiped at his chest and scrapped a gash.  It pushed Corbynn down the stairs.  He stumbled, dropped his revolvers and took cover behind a grate.  

From within the Documancy bag, Doldroma could hear scratching.  She produced her ledger and read.  ""Solution imminent.  Hold onto your hats"" it read.  She looked at Corbynn.  Fenn was kicking his revolvers back to him.  ""Corbynn!"" she yelled, excited.

A small, almost unrecognizable portal appeared in the air above the Merry Widow.  The Giant Shark was barreling down on the boat, closing the gap.  A bony, eight-fingered hand emerged from the portal and tossed a flask with a mysterious purple goop onto the boat's deck. It shattered.  The hand gave them all a thumbs up.  The digit approximating the ""thumb"" had three knuckles, but the message was clear.  The hand retreated into the portal and it disappeared.

Suddenly, the boat lurched forward, propelled by something other than wind.  Those left on the deck fell to their knees.  The baron's lance rattled to the floor.  Corbynn tried to recover.  From within his mind, an ethereal voice spoke to him.  ""Captain!  Oh my gosh, Captain!"" it said.   ""It's been so long!  I'm so happy to finally speak to you!""

Corbynn shook his head.  Now was the worst time for hallucinations.  After a moment he recovered and contemplated the notion that the voice might be real.  The world seemed to stand still.  ""Umm, who is this?"" he thought.

""It's Merry!""

Comprehension slowly bubbled up to the surface.  ""Wait… Merry Widow!?!"" he thought.

Fenn and Dolroma stared at him, confused by the situation.  He could see the Baron recovering quickly.  His crew was scattered, mixed with Sahuagin bodies.  A giant white fin loomed ominously in the background.

""Yes, Captain!""  the voice said.  Corbynn could hear something like a pause and a breath taken in his mind.   ""I have to apologize.  I overheard your conversation with Doldroma.  Well, I overhear every conversation on board, and I just want to say,  I don't know who Almond Drain is.  I've never met him.  But I knew, the moment your boots walked on my deck, I knew, I would only ever be yours.""

Corbynn couldn't move. ""...really?..."" he thought.

""Until my last sail catches the wind, Captain.  What are your orders?""

Corbynn slowly rose to his feet.  He held his revolvers in his hands and stared down the baron, who raised his lance in response. 

""Well then, let's sink a giant shark."" he thought.

""Understood sir.""

The boat lurched forward again.  Only Corbynn remained on his feet.  It pulled hard to starboard, a collision course with  Ba'mu.  Boat and shark gathered speed.  The Merry Widow bounced through the waves.  Corbynn compensated with each bounce, walking solidly up the stairs towards the baron.  

The giant shark opened it's mouth as it swam close.  Immense teeth glistened in the sun.  It jumped.  The Merry Widow pulled, exposing it's side to the giant's maw, and it crashed into the boat.

A pause.  Ba'mu's teeth were stuck in the wood.  Its jaw was propped open by two cannons, which had jutted out and embedded themselves onto his myriads rows of teeth.  Two more cannons pointed in its direction.  It realized too late it's mistake.  Four cannons roared.  Two of them split it's jaw apart.  The others embedded hot metal into its gills.  The boat rocked, as shark gristle rained down on the deck.  The baron watched in astonishment. The body of Ba'mu, the pale king of the sea, sunk to the seafloor.

""Ba'mu, NOOOOOO-""  his scream was cut off by the butt of Corbynn's revolver as it landed squarely on his chin.  The force of it knocked the baron to the deck.  Corbynn raised both guns to the Sahuagin leaders head, and unloaded, a multitude of shots ringing in the air.  There was nothing left of the baron's head but a spongy mass of pulp.  

Corbynn turned to the remainder of the Sahuagin on deck.  They were frozen in place. ""GET OFF MY FUCKING BOAT!"" he roared.  Tridents clattered to the deck, as Sea Devils sailed over the railing and plunged into the depths below.

\*\*\*

""And with that, I dishonorably discharge you from your service on the Merry Widow.  Get off my fucking boat.""  Corbynn clapped Moarg on the shoulder, who clutched his discharge papers in his hands.  Lines of concern deepened in his already leathery face, but his eyes gleamed with hope.

The Merry Widow sailed back to Neverwinter with as much pride as an animated galleon could be expected to express.  By the time it reached the harbor, however, the magics that brought it to sentience had dissipated, and it was merely a sailing vessel once again.  One by one, the crew took positions as it's animation appeared to fade.  Corbynn didn't care.  In his mind, the Merry Widow's words echoed over and over.

""And then we take a week off and come up with new names?"" Moarg asked.  Corbynn guided him to the gangplank.  Moarg hefted a bulging backpack over his shoulder.  ""That's the idea.""  The Tortle hung his head.  ""I liked it better when we was a union.""  

Corbynn walked him down to the docks.  ""Well, apparently interns can't unionize in AI, and they can't be promoted to member status without home office approval.  So, they told me to fire you.""

""And what's the new names for?""

""So that we can hire you next week as ‘consultants'.""

""What's a ‘con-salt-tent'""

""Someone that gets paid more than an intern, Moarg. Not a lot more, but more.""

Moarg's mood lightened immediately ""Aww, shit!"" he exclaimed.  ""I'm gonna git me a hum dinger of a new name, Corbynn.  You just watch."" ""That's great, Moarg,"" Corbynn said ""but listen, one stipulation I have is that you and the boys have to call me by a new name as well.""

""Sure, Corbynn.  What's that?""

""Captain.""

Moarg raised his hand in a muddled salute ""Aye aye, captain.""  Corbynn waved him off ""Not yet.  Next week.""  ""Oh yeah right.""  Moarg nodded and plodded his way towards the staggers and jags.  

Corbynn lingered on the docks and admired the sunset.  He turned his gaze towards the Merry Widow and smiled.  Fenn and Doldroma leaned against the rails, uncomfortable with his newfound sunny disposition.  He didn't give a shit.

""Well, we're in dry dock for a week ladies,"" he said.  ""We need to get these damn giant shark teeth out of the hull.""

Fenn touched her finger to her nose. ""Not it.""  Doldroma gazed at Corbynn, who shrugged.  "" I was gonna get drunk.""  She sighed and began to walk back below deck.  ""Fine, I'll get started in the morning.""

Out of the corner of her eye, she saw a short half-elf walking down the docks towards the Merry Widow.  Dressed in weathered leathers, with a pair of swords hanging from his belt, he had a bag slung over his shoulder. the Acquisitions Incorporated logo was emblazoned on it.  He had an eyepatch over his left eye.

Realization dawned on her as the sun sunk in the horizon.  Hastily she turned back to face the beaming captain.  ""Actually, Corbynn"" she said, unsure of how to proceed. "" I need to tell you something, but you're not going to like it.""  Corbynn turned to face her, cracks in his smile were already forming, but the last lingering tendrils of joy persisted.  ""Then I hate it already,"" he said, half-playfully. ""Shoot.""

Doldroma took a breath and braced for impact.  ""Remember when I said we should request a fourth member from the home office?""  A pallor shrouded Corbynn's face and the color drained from his cheeks.  ""...Yeah?...""

""Well, I sort of, maybe, did that already…last week.""

""Last week!?!""

The half-elf reached the gangplank and began climbing. ""...Hey…"" he said.

Corbynn's attention never left Doldroma.  Though taller than him, the Dragonborn seemed to shrink in his gaze.  Fenn glared at the half-elf and fingered her daggers.  ""Hey yourself,"" Corbynn said.  ""We'll be with you in a minute.""

The half-elf reached the deck and stood among them, his thumbs hooked into his belt. ""...sent from the home office…"" he said.  ""...name's German Goad...I'm your new Decisionist…""

9ar2cg,0,2018-08-27,AITA for buying my BF games that I know he would play but also want to spend quality time with him?,mirrortrex,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/9ar2cg/aita_for_buying_my_bf_games_that_i_know_he_would/,"Edit: Sorry for forgetting a TL;DR: 
Asked BF if he could spend quality time with me for around 3 hours, he agreed, not even half-way through he went to do some programming, I asked him to continue spending time with me again and he didn't seem into it so I didn't want to bother him further, said I would go back to my room. BF says I'm always thinking negative (that he doesn't want to spend time with me in this case) and we argued, I left and he blamed me for buying him games that he would spend a lot of time on, and I told him how about you learn how to control yourself instead of blaming me for buying you games

Today I had a disappointing argument with my BF. I asked him if he was okay spending time with me this evening (around 9pm-ish) only until 12am, because I'd be tired and want to sleep by then. He quickly jumped in the shower, so I jumped in mine as well, assuming he's all ready to spend some quality time with me tonight. We played some board games in my room, give or take 30 mins and one of the board games intrigued him into doing some programming for the probability of the board game, and he went back to his room while I went to the washroom. 

I was obviously disappointed because I thought he would still spend time with me, so I followed him into his room shortly after doing dishes. He was deep into trying to code, so I waited for a while but I felt frustrated so I went and made some dessert. Comfort food. When I came back with the desserts, he was still coding. I ate my portion, and made him ate his portion (he was the one who wanted to buy it), and harshly asked him to spend time with me out of frustration. He's like sure and put down his headphones, but I could see that he was tired/frustrated. Our cat came by with loud meows, and I laughed and said ""catname is the most spoiled and clingy cat ever"" and jokingly said ""just like me"". I got an instant reply ""yep"" and it kinda hurt. 

That aside, we both lied down on his bed half-cuddling and doing nothing (I was expecting to continue playing board/card games) and he started doing the counting in his head and was doing finger gestures. I could see that he's really not into it right now, and he was just trying to get the coding done so I said that I would go back to my room. 
He suddenly got really offended and said, ""Why do you want to go back? Is it because I'm counting? What's wrong with thinking about something else when we're together?"" 
I said that I was just trying to be considerate because he obviously wasn't into it and I was tired anyway. 
He proceeded with, ""That's not considerate. You're always thinking negative. You always think everything is against you."" (He felt that I thought he doesn't want to spend time with me) 
In which I replied, ""I never said that everything is against me. (I absolutely did not) Don't put that word in my mouth. I know how I think and sometimes I think negatively but I'm not negative all the time! Plus when you're showing that you're not into it, why would I think differently? What else am I supposed to think? If you don't want me to think negatively, then don't show me otherwise!""
He continued with something like, ""We don't have anything to do! We're not doing anything anyway, doing calculations in my head doesn't mean that I don't want to spend time with you! Why are you trying to be considerate? If you do that you get hurt, then everyone's not happy also.""
I agree, there were times when I tried to be considerate involuntarily because I felt hurt but I didn't want to offend anyone so I just tried to fade elsewhere, and he didn't like it when I did that. This time I can see he's not into it so I just wanted to not bother him, and I was tired anyway. 
But then I remembered, ""I know there are times when I shouldn't be considerate (with him), but I can't seem to feel where the line is anymore. Times when I'm inconsiderate with you, you'd just call me clingy, spoiled, I don't even know what to think anymore.""

He then brought up him starting work next week, ""This time, you know I'm starting work next week right? (hinting me that he just wanted time alone, to play games)
I replied, ""Yes, that's why I wanted to spend quality time with you, before we both get buried by work."" (I have a very tight schedule for the whole next month)
In which he argued, ""You know that's not true, when I was doing internship last time I spent every day after work with you! I didn't even play games that time!"" (3-4 out of 7 days in a week we would eat out after his work, we only spent time eating together, sometimes he's on his phone, besides me making him breakfast every morning before he went to work)
I agreed, it wasn't quality time together but we spent a lot of time in each other's presence.
Then he went back on his desk, so I left his room after that. It clearly wasn't going anywhere. 
He yelled behind me on my way out, ""Aaand you shouldn't have bought me games! This is why!"" 
I was almost livid when I heard that. Every single time that I bought him a game that he wanted or a DLC of a game that he liked and would grind for a long time, he would blame me for getting him to play so much, for getting addicted, spending a lot of time on the game. 
I replied loudly, ""How about you learn how to control yourself instead of blaming me for buying you games?"" I don't know if he heard it, but I hope he did. I feel a bit terrible for telling him that now, but I'm just sick of getting blamed for so many things. I feel bad for arguing about spending time together as well, but I just don't feel justified.

What I think: I'm not a clingy GF. We live in the same house but we don't see each other all the time. We have our own rooms, mine upstairs his downstairs and we see each other for less than 2 hours a day. I'm not controlling, I have my own work/chores to do all the time and he's always doing what he enjoys doing, playing games. We don't play the same games, so we don't spend time playing games together. We used to have the same interests but he's stopped that for a long time, and I only carried on occassionally. Only times I see him are when I go downstairs to his room on purpose just for hugs and during times when I cook/clean in the kitchen near his room. We don't even wake up remotely the same time, I wake up around 10am and he wakes up around 5pm. He just graduated and I'm still in college. We see each other everyday, but by no means have we spent quality time with each other. We don't even eat the same times or eat together. When we're eating outside I'd want some quality time with him but he's always on his phone. We don't have deep conversations together more than once a month.

We've been officially together for more than 4 years, and I'm still not entirely sure if he knows what I mean by quality time, even though I've attempted to explain to him more than a few times. He's not really a communicative person (from upbringing), while I'm absolutely huge on talking the right way (from the internet). I admit that sometimes I can be harsh and difficult, but I really don't like the way that I always get blamed for what we're involved in. Whenever we get into fights, I always feel like I'm always wrong for almost everything, even during times when he provoked me into feeling bad about myself, he makes a lot of assumptions on how I think negatively. I have depression, anxiety and chronic pain, but I'm strong. I'd like to think that way and I feel offended that he thinks I'm very codependent. (especially because he drives us everywhere and I don't because I don't have a car, and I can't drive his after one accident) 

Was I wrong to assume he would just spend some time with me tonight? Should I have thought whatever, he didn't seem into it but I'll stay anyway? I literally don't know what to think. He didn't agree verbally, but he was all clingy with me too after we both showered. I don't know if I'm the asshole for wanting his time when he's always wanting personal space. Sometimes I feel beyond cloud nine when I'm with him, but sometimes I feel lonelier around him than when I'm not. I can clearly see that he doesn't enjoy me being there all the time (neither do I, I like my own space too), but I feel bad for wanting to spend time with him. There are many things that I'd like him to do with me, but I always try not to come up as inconsiderate for taking up his time and energy, which I feel I do all the time. I always try to suggest something nice to do together, and I feel bad for being the one suggesting most of the time because I don't feel him being excited over most of it. I feel tired all the time too, but I'd always try not to show that I'm feeling very stressed or depths under the weather. I genuinely try not to come up as clingy but he seems to think I always am. I think I'll just not bother him the rest of this week and let him have his me-time before he starts working.

I don't know what to think or how to approach this. I don't know who's at fault and I try to think that we both are. This kind of situation has happened many times. No, he's not cheating, he's not into anything else, he's still very much in love with me. But there are times when it frustrates me a lot that he doesn't try to see from my perspective, and thinks that I'm absolutely wrong for thinking how I do. I'm not sure if I could ever scrub off the impression he has on me that I'm always negative. I've tried to tell him that fights are not meant to go this way. I told him that fights should go like you and me against the problem, not us against each other. I'm working on that, I hope he is too.

9ar9zh,1,2018-08-27,I need advice,jacksonroe93,marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/9ar9zh/i_need_advice/,"Hi everyone,

I’m nearly two years out of college and have been unable to get a full time marketing position. I graduated with a Marketing degree along with having experience with social media, photography, graphic design, and more. I had two marketing internships in college and I’m currently taking Google AdWords and HubSpot courses.

Over the last year I’ve worked in a business development role. I had success but it just doesn’t fit my personality. I have landed interviews with some good companies for Marketing roles but was unable to get an offer. I’m really getting discouraged because it seems like it has been impossible for me to get into a Marketing position. I can’t see myself doing sales long term and I feel like it’s doing nothing for my career progression.

I’m sorry for the rant, but has anyone else been in a similar position? I’m not sure if I should take another sales job or instead take classes and work a part time job to pay rent etc?

Thanks for any help!"

9as3gp,0,2018-08-27,[A4A] Literate Fandom Romance Plots,Coffeeandcatsrp,Roleplaykik,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplaykik/comments/9as3gp/a4a_literate_fandom_romance_plots/,"Hey all! I am still on the hunt to do a literate fandom romance rp. Below are a few plot ideas, but I'm open to any you may have! (Note: These are Canon x OC, with you playing the canon role)

New Royal Crush (M x F or M x M)

Bowser x OC Bowser grew tired of chasing Princess Peach. He knew she didn't feel the same way he did. So he decided to pursue a new person...

This can be kidnapping, or maybe Bowser shows a sweet side. Up to you!

Not for Long (M x M)

Wallace Wells x OC (Scott Pilgrim Rp) When Scott brings over his new friend from work, Wallace outs on his usual moves. His best friend telling him the cute boy is straight won't stop him...

The Lab Intern (M x F or M x M) Professor Birch x OC (Pokemon) When Professor Birch was told he would get a new intern, he wasn't expecting someone so cute. As his feelings grow by the day, what will he do?

SHE/HE'S MINE! (M x F or M x M) BTR guys x OC (Big Time Rush) After a new up and coming artist moves into the Palm Woods, the guys go crazy for them (except for Kendall). Who will this new artist choose?

This is a love rivalry plot.

New to the Force (M x M) The Ginyu Force x OC (Dragon Ball Z) After Guildo left, the Ginyu force hired a new member- but weren't expecting someone so adorable and begin fighting over him. What will he do?

This is a love rivalry plot.

Game on, dude! (M x F or M x M) Bastion, Chumley and Hassleberry x OC (Yugioh GX) After a new student moved to Duel Academy, the guys couldn't resist them. Who will the newbie go for?

I will play pretty much all other characters in this, and it's a love rivalry.

Colors (M x M) Beast Boy x OC (Teen Titans) Beast Boy never thought he would love again. Until a cute boy joined their team... Wait, did he like guys? How will he deal with his feelings as they grow stronger?

Moving on (M x F or M x M) Tom x OC (Star vs the forces of evil After getting dumped by Star for Marco, Tom never thought he'd love again... Until someone new comes into his sights...

If none of these strike your fancy, feel free to give me your ideas/fandoms! Other fandoms I enjoy but don't have a specific plot for: Adventure Time, Avatar the last airbender, Disney, Inuyasha, Left 4 Dead, Legend of Korra, Total Drama

⭐⭐ Here are my rules:

1. Please be literate. No text talk or bad grammar (minus the occasional slip up of course).

2. I only rp in 3rd person. This is non-negotiable. Please be okay doing 3rd.

3. I ONLY PLAY UKE/SUB, NEVER DOM!!!! MY CHARACTERS ARE SUBS ONLY!!!! You have been warned!!!!

4. Be okay with OC x canon

5. Please be an active role player overall. We all have lives but please don't just disappear for days on end and never return.

6. If you are looking for all smut, you have come to the wrong place. I am fine with a build up to smut, but I want there to be a focus on romance and plot.

7. Please be respectful of me. I am a very friendly person but the quickest way to end an rp with me is to treat me badly. I am a human that deserves dignity like everyone else. Insult me once and it's over.

8. I'm sorry, but if your profile pic has a real person in it, I would ask that you change it before rping. It really just throws me off as weird as that sounds (anime/cartoon pics, scenery and anything else really are fine).

9. I usually do written bios, but if you HAVE to have pictures, I only do anime/cartoon refs and will only accept the same. NO REAL LIFE PICS PLEASE!!!

I am fine with people of all gender expressions, as long as you play M! My timezone is EST US time. All characters will be 18+. I am working most of today but I will reply as soon as possible.

I think that's it? If interested, kik:

Hope to rp soon!

9as6iq,1,2018-08-27,I [22 M] am rekindling my friendship with my college roommate [22M; 2 years] after a straining graduation. I think he is asking too much of me.,Semper-Aethereum,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9as6iq/i_22_m_am_rekindling_my_friendship_with_my/,"TL;DR at the end. This might be a long one.                      

In my junior year, I decided to live in an off-campus apartment along with my previous roommate as well as a teammate from my college sports team. Lets call the previous roommate Phil and the teammate Jerry. As we were signing the rental agreement, the three of us agreed that chores and responsibilities would be shared equally. Overall we wanted the apartment to be clean and ready to use for anyone. Moreover, since Jerry and I were in the same major and on the same sports team, we came into the new apartment with the understanding that we would also help each other on the field and in the classrooms.                        
                      

Over the next two years of living with Jerry, I've been the one who has helped him out way more than he has helped me out. In housekeeping I frequently had to pick up where he dropped the ball in terms of trash, dishes, dealing with contractors / renovators and in dealing with neighbors. I remember in the summers, Jerry was still in town for summer school, yet I frequently had to take days off of work to take up chore responsibilities for him. He was supposed to open our apartment for a building painting project, yet I get called from work to open the door because he was sleeping. In the academic department, he ""only dealt with the theoretical"", meaning I had to build all of our models and code that took hours to make. In return, he would help me on a theoretical problem that took 10 minutes to write down. In our sport, he would ask me for advice on training and style (as I found an advanced trainer through a personal connection from a past-competitor). Yet when I asked for training or motivation help he would conveniently disappear. In job-seeking, I would constantly help him: working on his resume, creating a LinkedIn account, introducing him to company reps at career fairs, etc. In return? He referred me to a friend who had a connection to a job that was out-of-major.                 
                              

The biggest thing, however, was his breakup with his girlfriend about a month before graduation. His girlfriend (lets call her Sarah) had contacted me about a month before our graduation, stating that she wanted to break-up with Jerry. I had asked her to not disclose this to Jerry until after the final exams, as it would crush him to the point of failing his last semester. Sarah was insistent on it so I accepted it and prepared for fallout. Long story short Jerry obviously freaks out and goes into depression. I talked him out of dropping out and intentionally failing his classes in lieu of taking an ""incomplete"" grade and asking his professors to allow him to take the finals in the next semester (he is actually taking them next week). I got him to see a therapist and open up to a professor he admires to help solve his depression. Because of this, Jerry was delayed in his graduation date by one semester (albeit better than failing).                                
                              

During this time, Jerry had said and did some stuff that personally hurt me. He accused me of conspiring with Sarah because I helped Sarah get her shoes back from Jerry's room (after he refused to give them back to her). He called me a traitor and a spy. While we were originally supposed to graduate together, Jerry refused to go to the graduation ceremony because he thought of me as a traitor. It really hurt me that my best friend would just refuse to do this and call off our friendship. After graduation, we went our separate ways.                                   
                           

Two days ago, I invited him and some of my other friends to a surfing trip to rekindle the relationship. We went and had a great time. After I dropped my friends off, it was just him and I in the car ride home. We got to talking about Sarah and about random topics and it felt like better days when he mentioned that he applied to a job at XYZ Company and he needed my help. At my internship company (ABC Company), my old boss left to join XYZ Company. Jerry knew that my old boss loved my work and when Jerry had applied to a position at XYZ, he found out that he would work for my old boss. Jerry wants me to email my old boss and recommend him. I said I would think about it.                                
                               

I'm not sure what to do guys. He really hurt me but I'm not sure if that was a product of the break up or not. He is one of the only people I would consider my friend, despite the selfishness.                       
                               

&gt;TL;DR In college I believe I vastly helped my roommate out more than he helped me out. He's done some shit at my graduation that really threw our friendship into question. Now that our friendship is starting to renew after college, he wants me to recommend him to my old boss. Should I help him? Or am I being selfish?"
9asnwq,67,2018-08-27,"Black women who work in areas that are white/male dominated, what kinds of experiences have you had?",Schmonopoly,blackladies,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/9asnwq/black_women_who_work_in_areas_that_are_whitemale/,"I've had my share of experiences with it, I'd love to hear from others.

Here's an example of mine from a few years ago. [Note, I'm in a STEM field... so, lots of old white men (a good number of foreign men too) and I am also in the south.]  As a doctoral student, I was given the opportunity to work on a project alongside my advisor with another graduate school that needed some assistance. 

I arrive early for the first meeting formally dressed (pantsuit) and carrying my swanky leather laptop briefcase. I meet up with our college intern outside (she will be taking notes, etc).  She is white, wearing a polo and khakis, and carrying a notebook. 

My advisor is running late so the intern and I enter together and find the admin person for the school.  I hadn't had the chance to introduce myself or the intern beyond saying what meeting location we were looking for and what project we were with.  The lady (white, mid 50's) perked up and started going on and on about how excited they are to have for ""you"" ( meaning the doctoral student) for this project as she was walking us to the meeting room.  

The whole time, she is addressing the intern (who is slowly starting to realize what's happening and clearly becoming uncomfortable).  I decide not to interrupt her (I wanted to see where this was going).  

She brings us into the room (nobody else there yet) and leads the intern straight to a  spot at the table with a set of materials neatly laid out and tells her they prepared a special place for her and to let her know if she needs anything else.  I sit down, un-aided, at a different place at the table.  

The intern is silent and clearly looking to me for cues on what to do. I'm quietly pulling laptop and other materials out. My advisor enters the room a couple of minutes later and--without skipping a beat--announces ""Oh I see you've already met (my name), our talented doctoral student!""  
 
The lady turned white... and looked like she wanted the floor to swallow her up. My advisor didn't know why until later when we talked post-meeting. As good as those moments of vindication are, they can never completely make up for the frustration. You can almost develop a complex because you feel like you have to constantly look or act ""the part"" as much as possible to avoid being misjudged.  I know I looked as young as the intern, but this lady ignored all of the most obvious cues, like our attire and even the fact that I was the one who began the introduction.  

TLDR: mistaken by people for the intern, even with obvious cues... quite obviously due to race."
9asqsz,1,2018-08-27,[M4A] From Trainee Personal Assistant to the Trophy Wife of a Billionaire [Feminisation] [Romance] [Daddy-kink] [Long-term],clip-clop,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/9asqsz/m4a_from_trainee_personal_assistant_to_the_trophy/,"A Fortune 500 Company. Multiple covers on Times magazine. A spate of chat show appearances. You're one of the most successful and well recognised businessmen in the country. And all that before you've turned 40. 

Yet you never forgot your roots. Coming from a poor single-parent family, you know it took a lot of graft, and even more luck, to get to where you are today. And you don't want to be one of those businessmen who pull up the ladder behind you. Instead, you've decided to run an outreach programme, allowing one lucky young man from a similar background to you to experience a few months alongside you. You'll allow them to experience the world of big business, giving them an internship in one of your companies, as well as personally giving them lessons on the dos and don'ts of the professional world. And as an added bonus, you'll let them live in your multi-million dollar mansion!

But regardless of whether you want to admit it or not, there's a deeper reasoning behind your decision. Years of toil on your businesses has resulted in you neglecting your social life. You haven't had a stable relationship with a woman in years, let alone brought any children into the world. And sitting at night in your empty mansion, you feel overwhelmingly alone. You could get almost any woman in the world, of course, but most of them are just after your money, not after you. What you want is protégé, a companion, someone who cares about *who* you are, not *what* you have. And that's the real reason behind this programme. 

I'm your average 18 year old guy. I play video games, I go out with my friends, I refuse to clean my room. When I left High School, I thought the world would open up for me. But after rejection after rejection, I could see my future closing up. When I applied to your programme, it was one last throw of the dice, one futile hope at a future beyond blue-collar boredom. And to my surprise, my amazement, I actually got in!

However, when you finally meet me, seeing my surprisingly big eyes, lithe body and firm ass, you start getting different ideas, taboo ideas, ideas which you desperately try to suppress but fail to. In this young man you don't see a man, you see a woman, you see a daughter, you see a lover. And using your influence, you're going to try you best to bring this woman out into the open. 

---

Hi there! As the prompt suggests, I'm looking for a feminisation prompt based around a CEO turning me into their slutty new daughter. I will play a young man (18+) who has won the opportunity to be your intern for the summer. You will play a CEO, either male or female (but preferably the latter), who takes me on as an intern, but increasingly views me as a substitute slutty daughter. 

I would like this prompt to focus on our thoughts, feeling and emotions. For me, I want to be torn between my male identity, and the desire to be a wanted, loved and desired daughter. For you, you will struggle between wanting to give this young man a constructive and educative summer, and wanting to cave into your more carnal desires by turning him into your new slutty daughter. Of course the sex will come, but I'd also like there to be lots of character development and sexual tension. 

My main kinks are romance, feminisation, incest, cumplay/bukkake/gokkun, D/s (with me as the s) outfits and lingerie, build-up, free use, taking orders, name calling and group sex. My limits are u18s, excessive pain, non-con and skat/watersports. 

I try to respond at least once per day, although sometimes real life will get in the way. I write in the first person present, and generally try to write detail, liking around 3 paragraphs per response (although of course that fluctuates). In your response, I'd like you to include a little bit about your character, your kinks, and how you imagine this RP developing. I usually leave prompts up a little while before replying, so don't feel the need to rush your response. I'll try and reply to everyone, but one line messages probably won't get a response."
9aswx0,8,2018-08-27,Rudy Giuliani Continues to Do an Amazing Job of Protecting White House Secrets in New Tell-All Book,Sam82671,FutureTrumpHeadlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/FutureTrumpHeadlines/comments/9aswx0/rudy_giuliani_continues_to_do_an_amazing_job_of/,"&amp;#x200B;

CNN - Rudy Giuliani, Lawyer for President Trump, announced this morning on Fox and Friends that he has released a brand new tell-all book of his brief time in the White House.

&amp;#x200B;

""It's a real game-changer,"" Giuliani told Brian Kilmeade.  ""There's a lot of facts in here that you don't know.""

&amp;#x200B;

When asked for examples, Giuliani replied, ""Facts about the president's son-in-law for starters.  Did you know that he still holds a grudge about having to share his wedding night bed with both Ivanka and Donald?  Just this year, he was twice caught trying to fake his own death to escape the family.  Ivanka filed two sexual harassment suits against her father since February, but Jeff Sessions refused to recognize either of them after Trump screamed at him in a meeting.""

&amp;#x200B;

When Ainsley Earhardt suggested that those were very serious allegations, Giuliani responded, ""You want to talk serious allegations?  For two whole weeks Donald was adamant that all government buildings would get off the electrical grid and rely solely on coal stoves for heat and power.  Twenty-three top GSA members threatened to resign to get him off that ledge.  Not a day later, Sarah Huckabee-Sanders and Kellyanne Conway both had to physically restrain him from the press room when he decided to just auction off the Russian hooker pee-tape to the highest press-pool bidder.  Eventually, he calmed down and his secret service nanny talked him into going to bed, but the next morning we found some notes under his bed scribbled in crayon about defecting to the Russians.  That was a crazy couple weeks.""

&amp;#x200B;

With a worried look on his face, Steve Doocy asked Guiliani about the Omarosa tapes.  

&amp;#x200B;

""I've heard a few of them,"" Guiliani replied.  ""Most of them are mundane conversations involving treason and buying off porn stars.  One tape is nothing but Trump on the toilet.  You can barely make any words out over the sound of Donald furiously working in his coloring book and straining, all while humming Sir Mix-a-Lot's Big Butts song.  One of the tapes caught Donald propositioning an intern for sex.  When she refused, you can clearly hear him tell her that her body will never be found like all the others.  Omarosa caught a brief snippet of conversation between Trump and an unknown Russian about selling some state secrets.""

&amp;#x200B;

After a long pause, and Kilmeade looking off camera at a producer, he asked Guiliani, ""What about these allegations of an affair with a housekeeper resulting in a child?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Oh, that,"" Giuliani replied.  ""That's just the tip of the iceberg.  I've read the deposition.  They had an affair spanning five months and she got pregnant.  Donald bought her off, shipped her back to some other country, blocked her number, and promptly forgot about the kid.  The real story is how she reacted when our agents finally found her.  She alleged that Donald was engaged with numerous other members of the tower staff as well as the doorman who started the whole story.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Wait?"" Earhardt asks.  ""The door-MAN?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Oh sure,"" Guiliani answered.  ""There were numerous homosexual affairs as well.  Donald isn't as bigoted as everyone likes to think.  White, black, brown, male, female, ape, he is willing to have sex with anyone.""

&amp;#x200B;

Kilmeade again looked off camera at a producer with a worried look on his face.  ""Umm, that's about all the time we have for-""

&amp;#x200B;

""Donald has apparently just learned about Death-Eaters as well,"" Guiliani interrupted.  ""He's a bit behind in his reading.  Don't be surprised if you see a tweet in the next couple days accusing Hillary of leading Voldemort's supporters.  He told the senior staff that tens of thousands of people have asked him to investigate the Hillary/Death-Eater links that the deep state is trying to cover up.""

&amp;#x200B;

""It's probably time to go to commercial,"" Doocy said to someone off camera.  When Fox and Friends returned, Giuliani was no longer in the studio."

As an incoming freshman, who will most likely need LOR for Co-Terms, internships, etc. - how do you get closer with professors in order for them to get to know you better, and represent you positively in letters of recommendation?

In high school, I was very close with my teachers because the class sizes were so small - but most of the classes I'll be taking the first two years are quite large. I'm wondering what you all did to build relationships with faculty in larger classes; I am doing a STEM degree, so a lot of my courses the first two years will be prerequisites, and these are almost always filled with &gt; 40 or 50 students on Carta it seems."

&amp;#x200B;

Posting on this one to stay accountable. 

&amp;#x200B;

Been almost 2 months since my separation from my fiance. Realized I've been a pretty shitty person and working on becoming a better man and father. Was disgusted in myself that even though I was pretty alpha/DT, I found out that deep down I was a career beta.

&amp;#x200B;

**Read:** Jack10 posts, ""The Career Beta"", NMMNG, MMSLP, MAP, WISNIFG, Bang, and 60% done with SLSM and Millionaire Fastlane.

&amp;#x200B;

**Physical:** Haven't lost as much weight as I planned. Been going out way too much and drinking irresponsibly. Down to 215 and \~18% BF. Lost 2 inches from my waist and starting to see ab outline and jawline is coming back. Started up BJJ and Muay Thai again. I can't believe I went 10 years without them. It was always my dream as a kid to be a pro fighter. I will definitely be doing some BJJ tournies and ammy fights for Muay Thai/MMA in the future. Mainly lifting for maintenance as it's hard to fit it in my schedule. Going to switch to a 3x a week full body starting today, focusing on compound lifts with some accessories thrown in for good measure. 

&amp;#x200B;

Cut off my stupid long hair and went back to a clean fade/combover, and making sure to keep my beard trimmed. Got a new wardrobe and am definitely getting more attention when I go out. Noticed my ex showing more IOI's and can feel the attraction coming back. I would say one of my Red areas is my body fat. Bought a new kitchen/bathroom scale and will be tracking my macros. My goal is to hit 180 @ 10% body fat by next summer.

&amp;#x200B;

**Financial:** Not gonna lie, this is a big Red area for me too. I make shit right now as an intern. Realized I was a POS who couldn't provide for his family so we were forced to rely on my MIL and for my ex to work like a slave to support us. 

&amp;#x200B;

Enrolled into school to finish my BS in Computer Science. Looking back, I can recall my ex asking if I was going to go back for my BS while I was ""BSing"" on the PC playing video games. I can see now that it was unattractive as fuck for me to mess around when I could be working on something or spending time with my family. I have since cut off video games cold turkey. My expensive rig is now relegated to homework and MRP.

&amp;#x200B;

My plan is that by the time I am offered FTE next year, I will be finished with my CS degree. This will give me leverage with my current employer and give me the option to walk for a higher paying job. I am also saving up funds and researching on how to start my side hustle. My plan is to have it off the ground in a couple of months. Either way the plan is to be self sufficient and get a place for myself and my kids.

&amp;#x200B;

**Social:** Have reconnected with a lot of my male friends and I can say I definitely missed the male camaraderie. Have a solid best friend now who is a stand up guy. We've been lifting and doing BJJ together since the separation. I can say that my social circle now is the biggest it's ever been. I've always been a popular, likable guy, but always lose friendships due to my career beta ways. 

&amp;#x200B;

Been going out every weekend to socialize and work on my game. Having luck doing some catch and release, but I'm definitely not in the right mindset to push it further. Going to cut back on it as I feel as if the night life really isn't for me. I've been spotted a couple of times by my ex's friends or her brother when I'm out. This usually results in a butt hurt text from her the next day telling me she only wants to communicate through e-mail or something.. I just say ""okay"" or ignore it and things will go back to normal after a bit. Could a veteran tell me whether it was a good thing for me to be out and about in my situation (if I am trying to reconcile)?

&amp;#x200B;

Also did what I've wanted to do since HS and bought a stick shift sports sedan. The kids love it and so do I. My little one will be laughing the entire time with a huge smile on her face going ""it's so fast daddy!"". I'm definitely enjoying the masculine aspect of fixing/modding shit with my friends.

&amp;#x200B;

Sad to say, but I've never left the country. I have some plans to travel abroad next year which should be fun.

&amp;#x200B;

**Family/Leading:** Man oh man... I've been a disaster in this area for my entire life. I realized I've been boring as fuck and waiting for things to happen in terms of my family, or my relationship. I wasn't doing shit or even leading my ex towards sex. She was usually the one planning trips for the family or I would expect her to initiate, and got pissy when she didn't. Even towards the end she was trying to initiate, or asking if we could go out as a family, but I fucked that up.

 

I recently read a post about ""taking your kids away"" and had a moment of clarity.

It was hot as shit and my youngest was coming over. I was stressed out about what I was going to do so I thought ""what did I wish my dad did when I was a kid?"". I proceeded to research kiddie pools around my area, found one and got everything ready by the time she was dropped off. The look on her mother's face was priceless when she found out I had everything under control. Had an awesome time gaming the life guards and playing with the munchkin. My younger brother looked at me and said ""yeah, you're definitely a dad chad"". I gotta say.. It was empowering as fuck to plan something and execute it.

&amp;#x200B;

With my eldest daughter I've been taking her out on dates and doing activities together. I've taken her to BJJ and MT with me. She's been hesitant but has promised to try BJJ out for a month. I've been a shitty dad to her for most of her life, but I plan on making it up to her.

&amp;#x200B;

With my youngest I am taking a more active role in her life. She enjoys her dates with daddy taking her to the park, or to a swimming pool, or even getting ice cream with her sister. I've gotten a lot softer with them and make it my priority to be a great father.

&amp;#x200B;

As for my ex, there's been a couple of times where she's called me and complained about how hard it was for her being a single mom. Saying how she never gets any sleep etc. I don't know what the right response would've been but I've told her that this is what she wanted. She responded by getting pissed and saying ""I obviously haven't learned, and that I can take back my sorries"". Most recently I tried opening up by telling her that it was hard for me too since I wasn't there for my family and taking care of my daughter. She responded with ""you don't have to live here to do all of that"", lol I should have seen that one coming. She's also called at 2AM because my daughter wants me and is screaming her head off. I tried to comfort my daughter through the phone, would the best move have been to ask to come over?

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried to be more of the ""Oak"" recently. Last week she asked me to watch our daughter because she was feeling sick so I dropped off some soup for her when I picked her up. The next day I had my daughter at MT class and the ex called me freaking out and being a bitch, asking where I was and that I never let her know I wasn't going to be home. Usually my response would be to yell back or whatever, but this time I used some negative inquiry to find out the real cause. Looks like it was because she was stressed out about logistics for our youngest because her mom didn't want her to leave work. She told me she was bawling her eyes out and I could hear the munchkin screaming in the back ground. I calmly told her that everything was going to be okay, and to take her to the gas station to buy her something to eat/drink and that I would be there after eldest's class was over. When we got there, she had taken my advice and everything was all good. Told her I was taking the kids to get some ice cream and asked if she wanted to come. She kept asking where but didn't seem like she was against it. I didn't want to push it so I just told her maybe another day and took the girls by myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**Ex:** Oh boy.. It's been wishy washy. I've tried to remain stoic and aloof the entire time. There are days where she will call me and try to shit test me or be a bitch, so I just tell her that I don't want her drama and hang up the phone. Usually it will be after she finds out I was at a club, and she will try some power move shit. I've been a lot nicer to her and she seems to be softening up. Everyone can see that she uses our daughter to try and communicate with me, and she gets really sweet when I send her pics of me taking our daughter out, after she asks about her. On the other hand if I don't call for a night she will get bitchy and complain I'm not calling everyday.

&amp;#x200B;

Last night I took our daughter. When I picked her up she was definitely showing IOI's and giggling/acting girly while talking to me (she's gotten a little chubbier doesn't wear makeup anymore, but still wears her rings). Later that night she asked how munchkin was doing and I replied that she was ready to sleep. I was knocked out when I received a call from her around 11:30. I overheard her laughing and a guys voice in the background, it sounded like they were out. She hangs up and tells me ""sorry! butt dial!"". 

&amp;#x200B;

Of course I get pissed because I'm like wtf bitch, I take our kid for one night and you're out kicking it? I decided to do some recon so I drove to her house to verify. I see her car in front, and another car out front. All the lights are off in the house so either they're fucking, or left with a group of friends. At this point I'm pissed and have to calm myself down from gutting this fucker and eating him. I couldn't sleep so I did some research and found the owner. He's an old friend of hers but SUPER fucking beta. 2 kids, single father because his BM ran away to do drugs. This dude is super short and likes to set up ""bible study"" meets. I'm not even exaggerating but I'm sure I have this dude beat in every category and a lot higher in SMV. 

&amp;#x200B;

She calls me this morning to make sure I'm awake to get munchkin ready for daycare. I am and she starts giggling tell me  to stop lying because I'm ""pretending to be awake"". The entire conversation I'm pretty short with her while she's once again acting super girly telling me she'll see me soon when I pick up munchkin from her tonight (New Relationship Energy?). My cousin is still friends with her on FB and sent me some pics of her linking some video called ""not settling"" some stupid shit about white knights saving single moms, and some love song from this morning. She's still been texting me all day trying to ask about how munchkin was last night and this morning. I just told her ""she was good"" and left it at that. Any veterans care to explain her ""sweet"" attitude? Is it just to keep me on ice, or is it because she is seeing the new improved version of me?

&amp;#x200B;

Do I confront her Athol Kay style? Or just continue doing me and being a good dad and being nice to her? Do I even have any options at this point if I want to get my family back? It might sound stupid but she has a lot of sentimental value for me. I've been this girls alpha since we were kids. Took her v-card and alpha widowed her. Throughout all the stages of our life if I wanted her I could have her, didn't matter if she was taken or not and everyone knew that. She still has notes she's written every time I broke her heart. Though I do want her back, I realize that I would be fine without her.. and LTR's.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks again MRP.

9auvah,3,2018-08-27,[F4F] Exhibit C,Jilling_Time,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/9auvah/f4f_exhibit_c/,"""Hello everyone! My name is Natalie, and I'll be your tour guide this evening."" Oh great, *Natalie* was here tonight. Not that she was bad or anything, quite the opposite. She just knew so much about the exhibits that the guests would be spending far more time than usual at each one. ""If you look over to your right, you'll see our first exhibit here, the disobedient maid."" There were a lot of *oohs* and *aahs* from the crowd, as well as the sound of pictures being taken. I couldn't see from my current position, but I knew it by heart. It was a woman wearing a sexy french maid outfit entirely made of latex, with her hands bound behind her back and a feather duster sticking out of her mouth. ""As you can see here,"" Natalie went on, ""Alice here has been very naughty lately."" It was bullshit. It was just the shift she'd been asked to work. And honestly, she wasn't even the one that drew the short straw. ""Alice is stuck in this enclosure until she dusts off every single item in that room."" Typically there was a full bookshelf, a table with some ornaments, and a leather chair. A couple of times per evening the maid would ""accidentally"" knock over a chalice or decoration from the table, though sometimes it was deliberate. The crowd loved it anyway, looking on from the other side of the giant glass window.

Sure enough, Natalie spent ages answering stupid questions from the guests. Honestly, I just wanted them to move on. Eventually she did, although the next part was just as bad. ""Moving on, exhibit B here is known as the playpen."" I still couldn't see them, but I could hear the squeak of rubber and their (partially) exaggerated pants. There would be two girls in there, trussed up in latex bitchsuits that kept them down on all fours. I wasn't sure who it was tonight, but I knew they were both wearing ring gags that kept their tongues hanging out. Once again, the crowd cheered and took plenty of pictures. I knew the only exposed bits were their pussies and their tits, so their mouths would be busy tonight. The biggest variable was whether or not they were blindfolded or if someone had been given a strapon. Once again, Natalie took her sweet time speaking with all of the guests.

""Finally, we have the last exhibit in our tour tonight. And this one's a rather special one."" I gulped. I had been waiting for this for a while now, but I was still nervous. Not that there was much I could do anyway. ""Exhibit C, also called the decoration, is a personal favourite of mine."" That part was actually true. While Natalie spent plenty of time at all the Exhibits, this was one where she always got personal. ""Yes, there is actually a woman inside underneath all that."" I couldn't see the crowd, but I could feel them staring up at the wall. I was fully encased in a vacuum sealed latex prison, unable to move a muscle. My outline could be clearly seen by anyone. Despite the fact that my face was fully covered, I had a ball gag and blindfold underneath my bondage. ""As you can see here, this is one of our interactive exhibits."" Natalie pressed a button, and the dildo in my cunt started slowly vibrating. I screamed into my gag and writhed in place, much to the amusement of the crowd. My buttplug stayed still, so she must be saving that one for later. ""Don't worry,"" she told the crowd, ""you'll all get a chance to use the remote. Also, unlike the last ones, this is a hands on exhibit. You're welcome to get up there and feel any part you like."" I let out a groan at this point, both from pleasure and annoyance. It was going to be a long night.

I never should've taken an internship at the fetish festival.

***

Hi everyone, thanks for reading through that massive wall of text. As you can tell, I'm looking to be a toy for others to play with tonight. If you want I can be in one of the other exhibits, or if you have any new ideas, please let me know! You're welcome to be the tour guide, the people in the crowd, or the manager coming down to see how things are. Who knows, maybe you can be another attraction that gets to interact with the other exhibits?

If your a fan of latex, hard bondage, public, and orgasm control, send me a message. My limits are incest, scat, beast, and underage. Pretty much everything else is on the table. I've had some wonderfully creative prompts in the past, and I'm interested to see what people come up with. I look forward to getting some orange envelopes.

9av458,1,2018-08-27,[A4A] Literate Fandom Romance Plots,Coffeeandcatsrp,Roleplaykik,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplaykik/comments/9av458/a4a_literate_fandom_romance_plots/,"Hey all! I am still on the hunt to do a literate fandom romance rp. Below are a few plot ideas, but I'm open to any you may have! (Note: These are Canon x OC, with you playing the canon role)

New Royal Crush (M x F or M x M)

Bowser x OC Bowser grew tired of chasing Princess Peach. He knew she didn't feel the same way he did. So he decided to pursue a new person...

This can be kidnapping, or maybe Bowser shows a sweet side. Up to you!

Not for Long (M x M)

Wallace Wells x OC (Scott Pilgrim Rp) When Scott brings over his new friend from work, Wallace outs on his usual moves. His best friend telling him the cute boy is straight won't stop him...

The Lab Intern (M x F or M x M) Professor Birch x OC (Pokemon) When Professor Birch was told he would get a new intern, he wasn't expecting someone so cute. As his feelings grow by the day, what will he do?

SHE/HE'S MINE! (M x F or M x M) BTR guys x OC (Big Time Rush) After a new up and coming artist moves into the Palm Woods, the guys go crazy for them (except for Kendall). Who will this new artist choose?

This is a love rivalry plot.

New to the Force (M x M) The Ginyu Force x OC (Dragon Ball Z) After Guildo left, the Ginyu force hired a new member- but weren't expecting someone so adorable and begin fighting over him. What will he do?

This is a love rivalry plot.

Game on, dude! (M x F or M x M) Bastion, Chumley and Hassleberry x OC (Yugioh GX) After a new student moved to Duel Academy, the guys couldn't resist them. Who will the newbie go for?

I will play pretty much all other characters in this, and it's a love rivalry.

Colors (M x M) Beast Boy x OC (Teen Titans) Beast Boy never thought he would love again. Until a cute boy joined their team... Wait, did he like guys? How will he deal with his feelings as they grow stronger?

Moving on (M x F or M x M) Tom x OC (Star vs the forces of evil After getting dumped by Star for Marco, Tom never thought he'd love again... Until someone new comes into his sights...

If none of these strike your fancy, feel free to give me your ideas/fandoms! Other fandoms I enjoy but don't have a specific plot for: Adventure Time, Avatar the last airbender, Disney, Inuyasha, Left 4 Dead, Legend of Korra, Total Drama

⭐⭐ Here are my rules:

1. Please be literate. No text talk or bad grammar (minus the occasional slip up of course).

2. I only rp in 3rd person. This is non-negotiable. Please be okay doing 3rd.

3. I ONLY PLAY UKE/SUB, NEVER DOM!!!! MY CHARACTERS ARE SUBS ONLY!!!! You have been warned!!!!

4. Be okay with OC x canon

5. Please be an active role player overall. We all have lives but please don't just disappear for days on end and never return.

6. If you are looking for all smut, you have come to the wrong place. I am fine with a build up to smut, but I want there to be a focus on romance and plot.

7. Please be respectful of me. I am a very friendly person but the quickest way to end an rp with me is to treat me badly. I am a human that deserves dignity like everyone else. Insult me once and it's over.

8. I'm sorry, but if your profile pic has a real person in it, I would ask that you change it before rping. It really just throws me off as weird as that sounds (anime/cartoon pics, scenery and anything else really are fine).

9. I usually do written bios, but if you HAVE to have pictures, I only do anime/cartoon refs and will only accept the same. NO REAL LIFE PICS PLEASE!!!

I am fine with people of all gender expressions, as long as you play M! My timezone is EST US time. All characters will be 18+. I am working most of today but I will reply as soon as possible.

I think that's it? If interested, kik:

Hope to rp soon!

9av6xt,5,2018-08-27,Very Scared of Driving By Myself (Especially in dt Kitchener),GeneralTsoChikn,kitchener,https://www.reddit.com/r/kitchener/comments/9av6xt/very_scared_of_driving_by_myself_especially_in_dt/,"I've had my G license for almost three years and have never been on the highway myself. I've been on the smaller Conestoga Parkway highway with my parent/sibling, but even for a short drive to get to Waterloo or Conestoga mall, I get really nervous when it comes to switching lanes. This makes me doubt my abilities and thus, have never driven myself on that highway. Out of the 4 ish years that I've had my license, I've only driven at most 15 times by myself in the car, and that was probably only short drives to Fairview Park or my closest grocery store for example.


I'm starting an internship in dt Kitchener, and I'm really nervous to have to finally be required to take the car to and from work. I've gotten away with taking the bus from Waterloo to Kitchener for university, but my parents want me to learn. I'm really nervous because of construction and people honking and rolling their eyes behind me if I make a mistake or go AT speed limit. Today I did a test drive with my sibling to downtown and got really freaked out by the road closure and panicked. I felt bad for not being quick enough to make a decision to get out of it.


I'm going to have to learn to get to downtown on my own since it's a clear opportunity to do so and I know practice is all I need. I don't even need to take the highway to get to downtown (its a drive to get onto Charles basically), so it should be a motivator. I've done driver's ed classes in the past, but don't want to be spending more money on it (since I know all I need is practice). I'm just really scared of the tighter roads, construction and other drivers in kitchener who might honk at me for making a mistake :("
9av7gl,1,2018-08-27,I've never been this sad before,18nsadasf,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9av7gl/ive_never_been_this_sad_before/,"Throughout my life I've never really faced depression or being sad for long periods of time. Even if something unfortunate happens to me I usually recover pretty quickly and don't often show any signs of being down around people. But recently I felt like everything came crashing down on me at once. I recently just graduated from highschool and my parents pushed me hard to go to college. Besides my older sister, no one in my family has even attempted pursuing any kind of post-secondary education. Like most kids my age I had no fucking idea what I wanted to do. My parents didn't understand this and lectured me over and over about choosing a major, not wasting time, get my shit together etc etc. But I don't know what I want to do. People are always asking me ""What I like"" or ""What are your hobbies"" to get an idea of what kind of job could be good for me, but I don't know what I like. I GUESS I like computers but I'm not particularly interested in doing IT or any kind of programming. I tried getting into business and I couldn't stand the office setting with all the long meetings(I experienced this through an internship). I even thought about trade school and giving that a shot for a couple years and hopefully save some money to go to a 4-year institution. That idea was shot down incredibly fast by my parents. My parents are refugees from Thailand and they have a high expectation mindset, they want me to attend a 4 year and nothing less. After deciding on going to a local community college I knew my parents were disappointed. I couldn't decide on what I wanted to major in and didn't want to waste money because I would be paying for my education, I decided to attend a local community college to finish up my generals. I knew my parents were disappointed in me and it was painful. I argue with my mom so often I don't remember the last time I talked with her where I wasn't yelling. My dad works all day and comes home late but he texts me things about ""You're old now, you should know your responsibilities"" or ""Take care of your problems"". At this point I wasn't motivated by anything. I didn't want to go to school, I didn't want to try in school, I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life. But there was always a person that was there for me and she's my girlfriend. She was everything to me and we've been a couple for only 2 years(yea im about to make some bad decisions i know). It's cheesy but I literally thought of her every hour of every day. I decided that I wanted to better myself just for her, I wanted to try in school just for her. Because unlike me, she was incredibly smart and attended one of the better Universities in my state. This is super dumb I know but I wanted to work hard just so I could attend the same school as her. I didn't care if I had to give up everything to achieve my goal. I wasn't living my life for myself, I was living it just to impress her... This is where it became too much for me. She joined lots of programs and attends some rigorous courses in college. She had little to no time for me and I was hurt because I just wanted to text a little, maybe a sentence or two between her classes/programs but she said she has no time to talk with me and she feels guilty that even thought she always keeps me waiting, I'm always there for her. She has stated a month or two earlier she has lost some feelings for me. She sometimes post a picture or two on social media and it saddens me that she can take time to do that but not shoot a single text at me. I don't want this to become /r/relationship_advice so I'll stop here haha. Sorry I got carried away and wrote this long ass wall of text. I have some friends from highschool but I wouldn't consider them close enough to talk to them about this stuff. Now me and girlfriend are on an indefinite break and I'm seriously hoping that the worst doesn't happen. I just have no one to talk to. I've never been this sad before and I wanted to vent. I haven't had the motivation to do anything. I just cry quietly in my bed. I need something to light up a fire in me now... :(

TLDR; Never been depressed before, now my parents are disappointed in me because I'm stupid kid and girlfriend lost feelings and now I have no motivation to better myself."
9avocq,1,2018-08-27,Tales from birthday survival,InAHurryToSeek,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/9avocq/tales_from_birthday_survival/,"So today was my birthday and saying that I hate to be the center of attention is not enough to describe the bad moments I go through when I happen to be the center of attention. I can manage the family meetings just fine, but as soon as strangers get involved I feel so pressured when I'm the one in the spotlight; today this happened at work. 

I started in an internship about 2 months ago, and since I had to send them my info for the admission process they new my birth date, so they confirmed this with me at the start of the month (couldn't lie since I knew they knew) and planned a special menu for the eating hour of this day. This kind of thing seems to make normal people happy, to have a special day in which everyone organizes stuff for you and all that, but I can't take it because I feel like I'm in a spotlight and that every single little mistake I make can put me in a bad spot for the rest of my life (in this case for the rest of my internship) so I always suffer these kinds of things.

When I get to work I notice after an hour that I'm clearly more anxious than normal even tho I kept telling me all the past week I would go through it just fine, noticed because I couldn't't look at the PC screen for long periods of time; I start sensing this growing feeling of discomfort if I do so and need to take my sight off the screen to breathe and be able to work again. After all I was indeed more anxious than usual cause I knew what was ahead, in fact it all starts even before this day cause I bought a pie to show up with something for my co-workers, and all I can think is things like ""oh shit is this enough?"" ""will they think I'm stingy cause I didn't bring more?"" ""or is it like too much and they will think I'm some rich ass arrogant guy?""

So the time finally comes and we sit down to eat; I have to wait for people to look away to actually serve my plate cause they'll see my trembling hands when I try to do so and they will think I'm stupid. The forks and spoons are disposable and plastic made (fuck), have more trouble with those usually cause they feel like air in my hands and make me feel more insecure so more tremor. Thinking about all this and using all my goddamn energy to try to eat like a normal person I can't focus on talking and keeping conversation like a normal person as well; my comments feel off and in an enormous effort I try to laugh and distract myself when I can to make the whole thing more bearable.

By far the hardest part was when I needed to cut the pie in smaller parts and put them in plates so everyone gets theirs. Everyone watching my hands when I try to do so is the worse feeling in the world, and of course I get the classic comment people have made me all my life ""wow dude, you have terrible pulse lol"". At least this time it was when serving some fucking pie and not when doing something important like working on the lab or trying to take taking a blood sample, so I didn't feel like shit like I usually do. The suffering ends when it is time to go back to work and with all going semi-ok I considered myself as a man who had dodged a bullet.

I get home exhausted and decide to go for a lollipop to celebrate the day's end, and just when I think I'm safe, surprise! I didn't hear with clarity how much the guy in the store charged me for my purchase; instead of asking what he said I go shy and take my chances, so I give him what I think I heard. He fucking shouts ""NO, I SAID 10 MORE THAN THIS, DONT GET NERVOUS LFUCKINGMAOOOOOO"". Shut up dude you wouldn't last a day feeling the way we do. My fingers hurt from how tense my hands got, I couldn't actually feel them due to the shitty epinephrine dosis my body gave me at work so I didn't have enough energy left to have my dosis of self loathing due to this incident and just came home to rest. 

Happy August 27th people.

9aw2nl,9,2018-08-28,I'm sure you've heard this before,its_that_timeagain,exchristian,https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/9aw2nl/im_sure_youve_heard_this_before/,"I might bounce around in order to make a round-about point, so please bear with me.

My parents are very conservative and christian. I (about to be 24 years old) haven't been for quite a while and we get into ideological arguments occasionally, but it's not a huge issue. I've been in a happy and loving relationship for almost 2.5 years, and about a year in I started getting little hints about marriage and babies (to specify, I'm a woman) from them. This is not enough to annoy me, so I usually brush it off. Upon graduation, my parents expected me to almost immediately go to law school, get married soon, and have children soon after that. I decided that, after enduring some very traumatizing criminal trials through my internship, I really don't want to do law. My boyfriend and I do not want to get married until we live together first for awhile, and we would also like to be emotionally and financially ready (which to him means A) getting a job after he finishes his phD program and B) me having a job) for a marriage and a wedding. I think this is pretty reasonable, I don't feel ""strung along"" or anything, and I think living together before marriage is important. I'm currently living at home with my parents until december, so I can get some savings built up from working, then I will move in with my boyfriend. Staying with my parents till December is something we all agreed on, it was planned.

10 years ago, my sister went through the tale as old as time predicament. I think I will probably end up dealing with something similar. She was living at home, in a happy and loving relationship, and she decided she was going to live with her boyfriend soon. She was considering going for a medical degree, then she decided that she would rather be a teacher, and that that would make her happier. My parents weren't happy, they were convinced that she could do better, and that teaching wasn't sustainable income even though it makes her happy. When she moved out of my parents' home after graduation to move in with her boyfriend, all hell broke loose. My mom was throwing boxes at my sister, slut-shaming her, screaming at her about how they should get married before she wants to ""get some."" My dad often goes with the silent anger route, and usually makes really disarming jokes about physically harming the boyfriend. I remember my parents telling me when I was a kid that they weren't going to support my sister (at all) when she got married to her boyfriend because they had previously lived in sin.

So I want to add before I go on, I really hate talking about this because I feel like I'm shit-talking my parents. I know they care, but it definitely crosses a line sometimes. I've been called names by my mom: slut for dating guys (5-6 total) in high school, compared to Taylor Swift, locked out of the house, threatened with being slapped, bitch, compared to shitty relatives who have literally threatened to kill people. I've been ignored and gone unacknowledged for months when I cut my hair into a pixie haircut. I would like to think that I'm not like this, but these things deeply hurt to hear.

So I'm planning on moving out of my parents' home soon, into an apartment with my boyfriend. And there will probably be fucking hell to pay. There will  probably be crying, screaming, things being thrown, and just all kinds of shit. I will probably be screamed at about not going to law school, how I'm sinning, and all other sorts of things I've been yelled at about before. They probably won't talk to me for months. My boyfriend and I will probably get kicked out of the family vacation (this is the least of my worries.) My boyfriend will probably hear hurtful things, and this kills me. My sister, to this day, feels like a failure in the eyes of our parents. 

So- I'm just asking for your experiences, and your advice on the best way to handle this."

9aw63u,11,2018-08-28,[Light Sci-fi] A Matter of Memory (Final Session),XcessiveSmash,XcessiveWriting,https://www.reddit.com/r/XcessiveWriting/comments/9aw63u/light_scifi_a_matter_of_memory_final_session/,"Neither of us brought up the abrupt end of the last session. 
	
I hadn’t known if she’d be coming back, and I realized I was worried that she wouldn’t. I was worried that I wouldn’t find out more, because there was more. My sessions weren’t free. She was very well off. How did the girl from the orphanage end up in a fancy business outfit and an icy attitude? And, I could at least admit it to myself, I wanted to see her again. Her, not as a patient, but as a person.
	
I had almost broken out into a grin when she walked back in. She had walked towards the desk and chair, but I’d insisted we sit on the easy chairs again. She’d hesitated for a moment then obliged.    	   

So, we sat for a few minutes in one of our trademark awkward silences. 
	
I felt responsible for our last disagreement – I was supposed to be the professional one, so I broke the silence. 
	
“Ashley was, is, my ex-wife,” I said, making Lisa look sharply in my direction. I looked around the room, expecting my mind to have projected Ashley into some corner of the room, but she wasn’t there. I frowned but continued. I kept it short, and as sweet as possible. To dwell was painful. “We were married a couple of years, we had met in college. Then I was drafted for the subcontinental wars. After I came back, well, let’s just say you two would get along pretty well.”
	
“You ever…?”
	
“Nothing serious, no,” I said curtly. Again, I looked around for Ashley, but she was nowhere to be found.
	
Lisa had the decency to not say “I’m sorry,” or “I understand.”
	
“Your turn now,” I said. “I know it’s easy to forget, but you’re the patient here.”
	
That drew a genuine laugh out of her. “After the orphanage, I was cast out into the world without government support, or any sort of safety net, or any connections whatsoever.” She grinned. “It was the best thing that ever happened to me.”
	
It was one of her rare, real smiles, and I couldn’t help but smile myself. Not mocking, or predatory, or sad. For the first time, she was genuinely enjoying talking about her past.
	
“I worked odd jobs at gas stations, convenience stores, and restaurants for three years or so,” she said. “Met people who didn’t know me as the orphan girl, but just a normal person. Another person trying to make it in the world.” She shook her head, looking up to the ceiling, as if remembering an old memory. “I made the closest things I had to friends those three years.”
	
“What happened?” I asked. We both knew this was no fairy tale. We were sitting at the end of the story right here. She was a woman desperate enough to want to go for a complete Wipe. Something, since she believed Memories were all that was too us, was tantamount to suicide.  
	
“This one businessman I served regularly offered me an internship at his firm. Out of the purity of his heart, I’d thought,” she said bitterly. “Just one condition – he gets to take me out to dinner.” The emphasis on the last word gave me all the meaning I needed. 
	
“He was looking for a fuck,” she said conversationally, as if it wasn’t obvious. “And I obliged him,” the burning hatred was clear in her voice. Not at the man, but herself. “It was progress, I told myself. This was how I was going to get ahead.” 
	
Again, I began to get some insight. Those three years, the best years of her life, were a tantalizing prospect, an impossibility. A perfect state that could never be achieved again. I’d seen this before, hell, I’d experienced it firsthand. It didn’t matter if those years were actually as good as she remembered. She’d probably forgotten the nights without proper heating or when she heard gun shots outside whatever apartment she was living in. Just like I’d forgotten the fights I’d had with Ashley before the war. All that mattered was that in her head, she had tasted perfection and let it go. And she hated herself for it. 
	
“And so, I worked my way up. And I did work mind you,” she said. “It worked about half the time. The other half, well, I’d done it once already…” she shook her head, disgusted at herself. 
	
Again, the silence. I didn’t know if they worked as breaks for us to digest what had happened in the room, or just served to heighten the tension and isolate us even more. 
	
“And that’s it,” she said. “A murderer, an orphan, a whore. I hope now you understand why I don’t want to be me. Why I want to be someone else.”
	
I realized what was going to happen a moment before it did. I didn’t know who made the first move, me or her, but both of us were equally responsible. One second we were sitting across each other in silence, the next we were in each other’s arms, my lips on hers. 

It is human nature to find happiness in depression, to find some sort of outlet to deal with any excess of negativity you’ve had to bear. And the both of us had to bear quite a lot of it recently. Living through all those memories again, listening to each other’s stories…it was enough for the mind to want an outlet, to need an outlet. It was the same reason people have sex after funerals so often.
We were after all, only human. 

***
My work was supposed to have ended a few hours ago. 
	
We sat again on the easy chairs. Lisa’s clothes were a bit more wrinkled than before, and her hair was no longer in perfect condition. Otherwise it was as if someone had hit pause a few hours ago and now hit resume. The silence stretched between us once again. 
	
Lisa started to laugh. 
	 
It was a loaded laugh, a bit manic, a bit sad, and a little angry. “I don’t know why I just did that,” she said after she had finished laughing. “Did I do it because I wanted it? Because I thought you wanted it? Or because it was the way to progress? Because I thought this would somehow increase my chances of you approving my request?” 
	
I didn’t answer. I couldn’t convince her, just like I couldn’t convince Jack the law existed for a reason. There was no point in explaining the psychology behind what had just happened, and there was certainly no point in explaining what I felt for her. The sex was nothing, really. These last few sessions we’d already laid our souls bare to one another. 
	
“I don’t want you to do this,” I said. 
	
Lisa looked up at me. 
	
“This Wipe, please don’t,” I said. 
	
She blinked. “You don’t think I should? You think I don’t deserve it?” I couldn’t tell if she was angry or dejected. 
	

I shook my head. “As your psychiatrist I approve you for a complete Wipe.” I walked over to the table and held out a paper that detailed by assent. I signed it. Lisa went to reach for it, but I jerked it back.
	
“But as a person, as a…friend. Please don’t. If you’re right, and all we are is the sum of our memories…losing a person like you is a loss to the world.” A loss to me, I didn’t add.  
	
Lisa looked me in the eyes again with those deep blue eyes. She smiled sadly. “I’m sorry, Mark…but losing a person like that is a gain to me.” She hesitated for a moment then planted a brief kiss on cheek. She hesitated again. 
	
“And if I’m wrong,” she said, “if there is more to us than just Memory, well…then it doesn’t matter if I Wipe or not, does it?”
	
With that she took the piece of paper from my hand and walked out the room. 

***

“Look,” I said, “my decision is final. Your case is too frivolous to approve.” 
	
The woman, Margaret, scowled at me and turned away, pausing only to kick one of my easy chairs. In my head Lisa rolled her eyes and watched Margaret leave with slight amusement.  
	
The door to my office opened, and the Lisa in my head vanished. 
	
She walked in. Her hair was a bit shorter, her clothes a bit higher quality, but they were still blue and white. Her eyes were still the same stormy blue. 
	
“Dr. Oberoi, I believe,” she said, extending her hand. There was a sort of confidence about her. She wasn’t asking, she knew damn well I was Dr. Oberoi. 
	
I took her hand, and this time I didn’t have to force my smile.

9awe8d,4,2018-08-28,Social Engineering,leap-of-faith-,Devilrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Devilrp/comments/9awe8d/social_engineering/,"Most hacking these days is rarely done in front of a computer.  Breaking encrypted passwords is time consuming, potentially taking computers years to brute force a password, and with stricter security regulations, other intrusion methods are becoming harder by the day.  Nowadays its much more common to hack in the real world by gaining physical access to the systems. Indeed, the weak point in a system isn’t usually a computer.  It’s a person.  Looking and playing the part could get someone with malicious intent quite far, as it often just takes one person to slip up for a major breach to occur.

For a ghost like Ellie, social engineering was critically important.  A practiced lie would get her in the door, and then people would not think twice about seeing her in places she shouldn't be.

This job would be no different.  As usual, someone had responded to the constant, cryptic ad she has up on craigslist, asking her to infiltrate a software development shop in Stellarim and steal some of their trade secrets.  All she had to do was load the information onto a flash drive, and drop the flash drive in the mail.  Simple.

---

Ellie paused at the elevator for a moment or two, [casually dressed](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/482393601268252682/482405919473270784/j0lbU1m.png) for work.  Nobody spared her a glance.  After patting herself down in an attempt to find a badge that didn’t exist, she approached the receptionist.

“Hi, I’m one of the new interns, and I completely forgot my badge,” she said with a smile.  “I’m so sorry.”

“No worries,” the receptionist said, producing a clipboard and pen and handing it to Ellie.  “Just sign in and I’ll get you a temp badge for the day.”

“Thank you so much,” Ellie breathed, scribbling a fake name on the sign in sheet, not that they’d be able to match her real name to her anyway.

“Who do I put for sponsor?” Ellie asked.

“Oh, just put my name down.  Rhonda.”

Ellie did so, and was soon in the office.

---

Ellie found a cubicle near the other interns, popping her head over the low wall just as another intern was arriving for the day.

“Hey, what’s the username format here again?” Ellie asked.

“First name dot last name,” the intern explained, completely failing to notice that Ellie’s eyes were on his computer screen as he entered his username into the field.  He automatically pressed tab and keyed in his password, which Ellie managed to spot all but a couple letters of.

“Thanks,” she said as she sat back down.

It only took a few minutes, mostly because she had locked the intern’s account out and he had to call IT to get it unlocked, but eventually educated guessing got her into the machine and onto the office’s network.  From there, it was just a matter of plugging in the flash drive, and copying the needed files from network storage.

Ellie pulled up Visual Studio and pretended to work on a project while the copy processed in the background, not that anyone would even notice her to question what she was doing in the first place.

The flash drive was in the mail to her client before lunchtime.

---

[Ellie](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/481701415509688320/482360300109168641/VZjNLGD.png) sat at Blackdog Coffee, the cappuccino on the coffee table in front of her going largely unnoticed.  Instead, she looked through the contents of a manila envelope: pictures of her taken earlier during her small infiltration.  Normally that wouldn’t be a worry save for one small problem: she was circled in red in each of the pictures.

Her brow furrowed and her lips pursed as she thought of the implications of this.  Initially she thought it was someone at DEVIL who sent them, along with the ones that told her about the school, but now she wasn’t so sure.

((interaction possible, but unless you are 1) a god or 2) your character’s name is &lt;John Doe&gt;, you’ll need to think of a creative way to start it thanks to her powers))

The real question is, why am I a secret?

1) You're just plain tired of your love life being front page news on the gossip websites

2) I am scandalously younger than you, maybe not even old enough to drive to see you

3) Officially you're my boss (intern, PA, actor on your first project behind the camera, etc... )

4) We are related. Top choice is brother/sister but open to cousins, aunt/nephew, or even mother/son

5) I live out in some rural small town that could not handle the news you were visiting, much less sleeping with me

6) Some combination of the above. Most of these are not mutually exclusive, and some even work better together

As for kinks and limits, I'm pretty vanilla... specifically into agegaps, incest, cumplay, oral, teasing, body worship, and maybe anal or impreg... but let me know what you're into as long as it's consensual and no scat, gore, blood, bimbo, drug use, non-con, or BDSM as those are my hard limits.

We slept together before I officially started dating him several times... He had been pursuing me pretty much since the day I met him and made his intentions very clear. I wasn't that interested in dating him at first but we were fooling around regularly. Like, I would spend the night and he did not need convincing for sex as he would almost always initiate and he was very interested in touching me in any way he could. Intimately without it having to be sexual aswell.

My previous partner whom I had been with for 4 years could literally be described as an actual sex addict and was very kinky. Introduced me to BDSM, toys etc. He wanted it far more than me, and his limits were ultimately higher than mine but I am the kind of girl that will happily have sex multiple times in a week, if given a routinely thing and I do like to switch things up..

 I have a lot of toys and I like it to be varied. This wasn't enough for my ex and eventually we split. In that relationship, it was me who would say, I am too tired or no I don't want to do that particular thing right now. Albeit not often, it would only ever be me saying it and I don't recall him ever turning down my advances. I'm trying not to refer to that with my new relationship as I understand they are different people and have different needs. It just gives some back story to me.

In the beginning with my new boyfriend, it was not as often as my last but I had no issue with that... It was really once every few days and the general romantic tone of the relationship has only grown, our connection is amazing and I know he finds me physically attractive and from his actions, I don't think this has changed. I introduced him to a few things I like that he hadn't tried before and he seemed into it when I asked him. I also managed to help him with his issue over oral.. his ex.. well bit him and he wouldn't let me near it. That, is no longer an issue and he now asks for that on occasion and I'm happy to oblige. 

He has always had an issue with the following however: 
he WILL NOT go down on me, he says he can't handle it but has never been able to with any girl (he was actually considering therapy to help this) but I don't  mind not having this as I'm not the Hugest fan myself. 
He rarely used his hands on me too and he won't kiss me after oral unless I brush my teeth and use mouthwash and even then all he can manage until hours have passes is a peck if I PUSH it. Again this has always been this way...

I find this odd as his demeanor is very much a 'manly man's and yet he finds these things literally disgusting.. I've never experienced this before.

Now, the frequency of sex has...dropped Like MASSIVELY. I went away for a month on an internship in a different country and we did our best to help each other out sexually whilst I was away. He made it seem like when I got back it would be a sex fest and naturally I was pretty pumped for this. 

Well.. it hasn't been that way at all... 
I got home around a month ago and in that time we have had sex 3 times. I have tried several times and given up trying now. One of those times was really good. The other 2 were 3am pops where it was literally.. well. Pump pump squirt and back to sleep. No foreplay, nothing. My logic was bad sex is better than none right? He's asked me for oral a few times since and I've declined as he never considers my own need if I do this and I finish him to receive basically a pat on the back and he turns over to sleep again. 

I tried discussing this with him and was told that it's just because he doesn't need sex as much as I do. He often playfights with me or tickles me and if I move in a particular way to this, he accuses me of 'making everything sexual' even if I'm not actually doing that. 

We still kiss and cuddle and he slaps my ass, tells me I'm beautiful etc etc. and we'll everything else is amazing as I said but this thing is beginning to affect me mentally and physically.. 

I masturbate, watch porn and use toys to try and keep the urges away (god forbid he catch me though, I think he would go mad..) and I'm kind of just leaving him to it. I don't feel I can initiate anymore when I get constant rejection. I think he knows he's basically starving me of sex and he makes jokes telling me I better not cheat etc. Of course I would never, but this is getting difficult now. I don't want to be 23 and having issues with sex already.. it just feels like he's being quite selfish about it all.

I'm wondering if this is something I've done to freak him out or if he does just have a low libido? Or is it stress like I've read in other places? 

I just wondered if anyone had any suggestions on what I can do to try and help the situation?

Acum caut de munca într-un loc unde ma pot dezvolta și câștigă mai bine. Am început sa cred ca este ceva în neregula cu mine/așteptările mele sau cu piața de munca din RO. Dilemele mele sunt la sfârșitul textului lung. 

Eram mic și energic când am dat de gustul banilor pentru prima data. Și pentru o buna perioada de timp am încercat sa ii produc prin toate metodele.

Mulți ani mai târziu și am început facultatea. Nu am mai produs nimic concret care sa ma țină la suprafață pentru ca ai mei insistau sa îmi trimită cash ori de câte ori le ceream: ""dacă dai de gustul banilor, nu mai termini facultatea"". Ca un tip ce vreau sa ma dezvolt am decis sa investesc în mine dacă tot am atât timp liber asa ca m-am înscris într-un ONG, am încercat sa învăț tot ce pot de acolo și din tutoriale și workshop-uri gratis. Dar parca lipsea ceva.

La sfârșitul anului 3, în timp ce fumam o țigară și beam o cafea cu doi prieteni, am văzut un flyer de work and travel. Și aici începe prima mea experienta cu un job. Mers acolo, muncit, luat second job ca să dau banii înapoi alor mei. Lucram la ceva hotel cu program fix. Banii veneau fără probleme și câștigăm mai mult decât minimul. Îmi permiteam sa fac multe și sa îmi cumpăr multe, în general pentru ca nici nu prea ma presau ai mei sa le dau banii inapoi. Viata era frumoasa. Am zis ca știam eu de ce ma mai gândeam uneori ca e nasol la facultate și vreau sa încep sa lucrez cât mai repede ca să fac bani, bani, bani.

2017 și termin facultatea. Fericire maximă pentru ca planul era sa ma mut în București sa fac o grămadă de bani. Ajung în capitala și ma angajez fix după doua săptămâni într-o firma care opera pe domeniul la care am studiat timp de 4 ani, aparatura medicala. Inginer, am un bagaj de informații obținute prin self-teaching și voluntariat, am fost atent în facultă și sunt destul de descurcăreț, sigur le place de mine și obțin o poziție bună.

Primul interviu, minimul pe economie.

Am zis ok, faptul ca sunt inginer nu înseamnă că știu totul, trebuie sa obțin experienta, nu ma deranjează ca sunt bani putini pentru ca sigur voi negocia undeva mai bine după un an. A trecut un an de munca în care lucram minim 10 ore pe zi, fără overtime plătit, cu telefoane primite non-stop din toate părțile (nu conta ora), cu probabilitatea sa mor pe drumurile patriei în fiecare zi din cauza infrastructurii proaste, fără timp sa investesc în proiectele pe care le aveam în cap și din care credeam ca pot sa obțin atât satisfacție cât și bani. A, da, în timpul asta am reușit sa obțin o mărire de salariu cu 300 lei.

Și am zis ca asta nu este de mine. Nu aveam posibilitate reala de a avansa sau a acumula mai multe cunoștințe, salariile în firma erau relativ mici (&lt;800€ la 15 ani vechime pe postul de inginer) și oricât am fi discutat despre cât overtime fac și ca îmi doresc sa am timp liber pentru mine sau măcar sa fiu plătit, nu ma lua nimeni în serios. Asa ca din impulsivitate de moment, mi am dat demisia. Aveam o oarecare experienta, știam ca dacă lucrez în continuare în domeniu nu voi obține niciodată cariera pe care mi-o doresc dar nici nu eram pregătit pentru alte domenii de activitate din cauza profilului facultății. Am considerat ca cea mai buna soluție este sa aplic pe un internship plătit într-o companie mare: te învață modul lor de lucru de la zero, ai posibilitatea sa ramai în companie, poți avansa proporțional cu munca depusa...

Au trecut 2 luni de când mi am dat demisia și încă nu îmi dau seama dacă fac ceva greșit sau nu sunt o persoana destul de buna pentru companiile din România. Am aplicat în acest timp la 10 internship-uri plătite și o singura companie m-a contactat. Am susținut câteva examene și interviuri și încă aștept răspuns de la ei. În rest, din multitudinea de CV-uri trimise, nimeni nu mi-a scris niciodată nimic. 

Dilemele mele:

Este chiar asa de greu sa găsești un job bun în România?

Este de prost gust ca îmi doresc sa câștig mai mulți bani ca să pot face și altceva în afara de plătit chiria?

Sunt așteptările mele prea mari de la piața de job-uri din RO sau cum ar trebui sa meargă lucrurile?

Am o imagine prea buna despre mine? 

Merita munca depusa în acești ani de facultate pentru a ma dezvolta, având în vedere ca pare egal cu 0 pentru majoritatea firmelor, sau ar fi trebuit sa stau și eu la o sămânță și un petuț ca ceilalți colegi?

9axnsi,2,2018-08-28,[Blog Post] Unfair Lankan Dating Standards,MsConfidential,srilanka,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/9axnsi/blog_post_unfair_lankan_dating_standards/,"If there is one thing Sri Lankans are good at it is to impose ‘standards’ and ‘rules’. Take, for instance, the entrance fee to Pinnawala, or how the traffic rules and corresponding fines change according to the type of vehicle and how closely associated they are to the former regime. There seems to be information that is being passed on to other generations of how things should be, even in dating. I hadn’t seen the full gravitas of this until I took to Reddit to discuss unfair dating standards they’ve encountered; below are some of the finest!

https://i.redd.it/x1kc0d2c5ti11.gif

***1. The Divorced Dundee***

https://i.redd.it/hovia4xt4ti11.gif

In a country that allowed brothers to share a wife to safeguard property, people seem to have a moral issue with divorced persons wanting to get back in the dating pool. It was apparently okay for them to have a roster on whom the wife should be sleeping with for the night, but a divorcee is vehemently denied any opportunity of love. 

***2. Solo Polo***

https://i.redd.it/lrw8bq7o4ti11.gif

Nothing makes me happier than seeing single parents dating (others) again. It’s bad enough that they had to raise children on their own, not have anyone to prop the garbage near the gate in the wee hours of the morning, making meals for one, fending off inquisitive relatives and still people will hold a microscope under them to analyse their behavior to judge what is right or not. What a bad example she is setting for the children! Is she barking up yet another one of those trees? 

***3. Demonizing the Divorced***

https://i.redd.it/lz6uz4hynsi11.gif

What’s worse is parents not wanting their divorced daughter to date a divorced guy because ‘what will society say?’ Double standards, much? Maybe all divorced persons should sound a bell carrying a board saying ‘stay away’ like lepers from olden days.

***4. Dating Over Time***

https://i.redd.it/fir2tljo6ti11.gif

First, they bombard you with questions of when the wedding is and then criticize the process of narrowing the selection process down. Isn’t it funny how sometimes Lankans refer to each other by their social life than by their profession like ‘the one who always parties' and not ‘the brand manager of X company'? It's no wonder that word of mouth is still the most powerful form of advertising on our little island.

***5. Hibernation Highs***

https://i.redd.it/r2lj6k0u5ti11.gif

Some people prefer not to date and there’s no problem in that. Perera Aunty next door, however, speculates your sexuality and asks your mother, ‘A*lways with girls, no?*’ Nothing seems to please these Nosey Nannies – even if you choose to lead a quiet life or are a number 04. Perhaps the two hourly dose of *Randepaya* doesn’t satiate their needs.

***6. Swipe Past Online***

https://i.redd.it/cysmhdxnnsi11.gif

Colombo for the last few years has been experiencing severe shortage with young, available men. With a limited shelf life of each of these species, the wisest thing to do is to look for other sources to replace this depleting stock. Somehow it’s perfectly fine to find your SO at Kama but your Karma isn’t aligned if you find him online.

***7. The Young and the Yule***

https://i.redd.it/px1gy9r1nsi11.gif

Some people prefer Newdale Fruit yoghurt while some others prefer Tissamaharama curd. When some others' choice pick is cheesecake, it's no surprise that others' preference in men and sweetmeats are ‘*aluwa’*. Leave them be!

***8. Syria to Siriyawa***

https://i.redd.it/5o5auom07ti11.gif

For the longest time, I thought it was girls who were subject to labels of being ‘too fat’, ‘*dang* board’, or ‘dark’. I could not have been more wrong. I also realised in the conversations that I was having that there are some variables that can be salvaged while some others cannot, like body weight vs. height. I’ve had my 20-something-old heart plummet when someone I was crushing on told me in the nicest (how?) possible way that he would marry me without a shadow of a doubt if I lost thirty pounds. Face value goes a long way for Sri Lankans – whether you have *‘siriyawa’* or look like war-torn Syria. 

***9. The Temps***

https://i.redd.it/g2j3fv44nsi11.gif

Have you encountered the type of “relationship” that is temporary for one person? I find this disturbing. After months of dating, one party casually tells the other that they should start seeing other people if they want a healthy relationship. The point of dating is narrowing in on the prospects, not widening them. So, just like the office interns who spend 3 hours a day for 18 months ‘filing’ soon vacate the premises for better prospects when the new interns settle in.

***10. All’s Well, Ends Well***

https://i.redd.it/cpjtmrndnsi11.gif

Not all marriages will end well so there’s no need to assume that dating will. Dating, is a test run, if you may, of the destination ahead of you, and just like the 168 bus that never reaches its destination because of constant breakdowns, you’re bound to reach your destination sooner if you re-route or catch the next bus.

I have completed my undergrad in Architecture and am currently working as an intern at a practice. I have decided that I want to sell my soul and become a developer. I have my reasons. However, now I have 2 options. 

1) qualify as an architect first 

2) study business. 

I know for sure that I want to go back to university and get a masters degree, the question is whether I do it in Arch or Business. On one hand, arch is fun to study, but a part of me thinks a business degree would be more useful. I would become an architect at 26 before then pursuing my career in development as possibly a project manager.

The question: Would qualifying as an architect help me as a developer? I've been told qualifications are really important for employers. Would also being a qualified architect set me apart from others when I'm further on in my career. Is it a good thing to have under my belt. The alternative is a business education.

&amp;#x200B;

Would appreciate any thoughts you guys have.

Logically, I've been running from feelings of love and only dates (quite alot) casually (e.g. tinder).

Last week I met an amazing girl. We were supposed to only go for a simple drink, but things escalated and now we've spent this whole week together. We're both people that don't fall in love easily (both fine with single life), however, this is starting to look alot like it. The thing is, she's leaving to Capetown for 4 months (internship) this week and we're both sad that we have to say goodbye so soon, after finally meeting someone we would actually get into a relationship with.

We talked about it last night and we both agreed that this is a rare thing for both of us. We both feel sad that we have to say goodbye and we agree that this could have turned into something beautiful. She carefully suggested something about me visiting her there.. At first I thought I should just let her go and hope for the best when she returns. However, she told me that we'll see how things turn out, and that we just need to follow our feelings.

​

I was already considering traveling after my master's degree (almost done) and now I'm thinking of actually visiting her there. It's not a huge risk for me.. I have a job now where I could return anytime, I have quite some savings, I won't have much financial liabilities in november.. so why not?

How should I handle this? My heart tells me to just go.. but what is the best way to prepare for this? Should we wait for a couple weeks and see if the sparks are still there? On the other hand, I think some sparks will always go away for a bit if you only have digital contact.. So what will that tell me then?

​

So just in general.. what do you think?"
9aza1m,35,2018-08-28,Will I be able to hold up as an intern at a recording studio even though Ableton is my DAW of choice?,zentothetenth,audioengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/9aza1m/will_i_be_able_to_hold_up_as_an_intern_at_a/,"I've spent the past few years studying up on audio engineering on my own. After spending a week working out of Capitol Studios in LA, I've fell in love with the pro studio environment. 

Since I am now back home in NYC, I've decided to shop myself around to a few studios. One thing that's bothering me is my lack of Pro Tools expertise. As far as I am aware, most studios in the city are Pro Tools based. Although I have a year's worth of Pro Tools tracking experience with work I did for my college radio station, it's not my DAW of choice, and I am far from an expert.

Despite my lack of Pro Tools expertise, I am keen on mixing concepts, and I am familiar with several plugin suites that are found in pro studios.

Does anyone foresee me being held back in a professional environment? Could I be negatively judged, or even denied an internship, because of my lack of Pro Tools skills? When I spent the week working out of Capitol Studios, the engineers I was working with were using Ableton, but this seems to be a minority in the industry.

Much thanks in advance for your insight /r/audioengineering!"
9azaez,17,2018-08-28,Can we talk about the US Open Highlights?!,razorsharp3000,tennis,https://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/9azaez/can_we_talk_about_the_us_open_highlights/,"I didn't think it was possible, but the US Open highlights have actually managed to regress as compared to last year -.- Not only are all the highlights like max two minutes or so, [they've even stopped including the frickin match point in the highlights!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXQ_gybaOA). Also, they've decided to have personalized titles for the match highlights, like the one for [Serena's match](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TWWpxu8GKI), which somehow manages to not even include the opponent's name! :P Not to mention the horrible camera angles are such a turn off and give such a disconnected viewing experience. I really can't believe the incompetence of the people handling the official YouTube channel! Even unpaid interns could do a much better job of managing the channel.

I'm really sorry RG and Wimbledon for dissing your highlights earlier, USO has managed to take it to a whole new level of ineptitude. Even the shitty ATP highlights are better. The only highlights on the men's side which are decent are those of the AO channel. AO best slam confirmed! ;) They have even started putting [extended highlights of classics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JQCUZ7wH_8), so shout out to them! Also a shoutout to the WTA channel for having improved their highlights greatly recently, for example [the recent Cincinnati finals](https://youtu.be/g0N_hVvXOOc).

You know.. the main thing that pisses me off is that okay fine, even if you can't make highlights despite being paid for it, at least let the way more the competent YouTube channels make excellent 10-15 minute highlights so that us viewers can watch. But no, that have to block all those highlights and get them taken down :/ 

The US Open really has a lot of work to do if they want to change their image. I really hope that someone knocks sense into the US Open organizers and we get better highlights in the future, or else they are simply going to reduce the interest of the more casual fans who simply watch tennis during the slams.

Anyways, angry rant over... thanks for reading! :D"
9azbcf,1,2018-08-28,[A4A] Literate Fandom Romance Plots,Coffeeandcatsrp,Roleplaykik,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplaykik/comments/9azbcf/a4a_literate_fandom_romance_plots/,"Hey all! I am still on the hunt to do a literate fandom romance rp. Below are a few plot ideas, but I'm open to any you may have! (Note: These are Canon x OC, with you playing the canon role)

New Royal Crush (M x F or M x M)

Bowser x OC Bowser grew tired of chasing Princess Peach. He knew she didn't feel the same way he did. So he decided to pursue a new person...

This can be kidnapping, or maybe Bowser shows a sweet side. Up to you!

Not for Long (M x M)

Wallace Wells x OC (Scott Pilgrim Rp) When Scott brings over his new friend from work, Wallace outs on his usual moves. His best friend telling him the cute boy is straight won't stop him...

The Lab Intern (M x F or M x M) Professor Birch x OC (Pokemon) When Professor Birch was told he would get a new intern, he wasn't expecting someone so cute. As his feelings grow by the day, what will he do?

SHE/HE'S MINE! (M x F or M x M) BTR guys x OC (Big Time Rush) After a new up and coming artist moves into the Palm Woods, the guys go crazy for them (except for Kendall). Who will this new artist choose?

This is a love rivalry plot.

New to the Force (M x M) The Ginyu Force x OC (Dragon Ball Z) After Guildo left, the Ginyu force hired a new member- but weren't expecting someone so adorable and begin fighting over him. What will he do?

This is a love rivalry plot.

Game on, dude! (M x F or M x M) Bastion, Chumley and Hassleberry x OC (Yugioh GX) After a new student moved to Duel Academy, the guys couldn't resist them. Who will the newbie go for?

I will play pretty much all other characters in this, and it's a love rivalry.

Colors (M x M) Beast Boy x OC (Teen Titans) Beast Boy never thought he would love again. Until a cute boy joined their team... Wait, did he like guys? How will he deal with his feelings as they grow stronger?

Moving on (M x F or M x M) Tom x OC (Star vs the forces of evil After getting dumped by Star for Marco, Tom never thought he'd love again... Until someone new comes into his sights...

If none of these strike your fancy, feel free to give me your ideas/fandoms! Other fandoms I enjoy but don't have a specific plot for: Adventure Time, Avatar the last airbender, Disney, Inuyasha, Left 4 Dead, Legend of Korra, Total Drama

⭐⭐ Here are my rules:

1. Please be literate. No text talk or bad grammar (minus the occasional slip up of course).

2. I only rp in 3rd person. This is non-negotiable. Please be okay doing 3rd.

3. I ONLY PLAY UKE/SUB, NEVER DOM!!!! MY CHARACTERS ARE SUBS ONLY!!!! You have been warned!!!!

4. Be okay with OC x canon

5. Please be an active role player overall. We all have lives but please don't just disappear for days on end and never return.

6. If you are looking for all smut, you have come to the wrong place. I am fine with a build up to smut, but I want there to be a focus on romance and plot.

7. Please be respectful of me. I am a very friendly person but the quickest way to end an rp with me is to treat me badly. I am a human that deserves dignity like everyone else. Insult me once and it's over.

8. I'm sorry, but if your profile pic has a real person in it, I would ask that you change it before rping. It really just throws me off as weird as that sounds (anime/cartoon pics, scenery and anything else really are fine).

9. I usually do written bios, but if you HAVE to have pictures, I only do anime/cartoon refs and will only accept the same. NO REAL LIFE PICS PLEASE!!!

I am fine with people of all gender expressions, as long as you play M! My timezone is EST US time. All characters will be 18+. I am working most of today but I will reply as soon as possible.

I think that's it? If interested, kik:

Hope to rp soon!

9b00k0,47,2018-08-28,My first fuck -- and it was international,crazyluckyasian,alasjuicy,https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/9b00k0/my_first_fuck_and_it_was_international/,"Okay shet. I don't know where to start. This is all new to me I never expected my first sexual encounter would be with someone from work. But anyway, here's my story:

I'm one of the privileged kids you'll meet in class. My mom and dad both have their own businesses, so from that you already have an idea na may kaya kami. Dahil rin doon I'm pressured to do well in the university I'm attending bc I want to make sure I'd get a good job (or start my own business) and be able to sustain my current lifestyle when I finally become independent. Kaya naman noong nagkaroon ng opportunity sa univ namin to have internships abroad, I knew I needed to get into one. Shet ang bango sa resume, I thought to myself. It was a challenge accepted, and a challenge completed hehe.

Blablabla yada yada, I'm here abroad now (western country). My workplace is diverse as heck, iba't ibang lahi ang makikita sa bawat lingon. However, in the unit I'm assigned to, I'm the only asian. But okay wait I feel like this is getting dragged too long already. I'll just cut it here and get into the juicy bits. If you want more details, ask nalang then I'll answer sa comments haha.

So here's the sexual part: I have a colleague named Marina. She's russian and more than 10 years older than me. I'm in my early 20s and she's in her mid-30s. Her age doesn't show tho, at first I thought she was just around my age. Blonde, 5'5"", and really white. Her looks were just average, imo. 7/10.

My desk is positioned right across hers. I won't talk about my work here bc it'd be a dead giveaway to my friends who frequent this sub, but I work closely with Marina. Close enough that sometimes we go for a late lunch just so we could have a bit of privacy in the pantry. She was particularly interested in ""our kind"" of asian (not sure if i should take that as a compliment or not) because so far she had only met -ese asians.

Sorry that paragraph above wasn't sexual at all, but I promise I'm trying my best to get into it. Anyway. Fridays here are like the sabbath for locals. Time to get wild and unwind after a week-long work. So me, being the new guy, Marina asked if I had plans after work and if I would be willing to hang out if I'm free. She wanted to show me around and I happily obliged.

We went out to grab dinner and a few drinks afterwards. The bar we went to was becoming packed as midnight is fast approaching. We were already talking deep about our personal lives so we needed privacy again. I asked her if I could walk her to her apartment instead (she lives nearby) and wrap up our convo along the way and call it a night. She said yes.

Sorry again, sexual stuff is taking too long but I have to write as much as I can remeber before this becomes ""that"" memory na lang. Anyway, at that point when we walked out of the bar, I was already kind of horny. Hell, when she asked me out pa lang tbh I was already fantasizing in my head but ofc I shouldn't expect so I won't be disappointed should nothing happen.

So we walked a few blocks to her apartment. When we stopped I was HOPING she would ask me to stay a little bit more for coffee or something, bc honestly I could tell she liked talking to me, too. And yes tenkdahevuns she did. She asked if I wanted to rest for a while since my place is about an hour from hers. Hehe ofc i said yes.

That's where it gets crazy. What happened next was so unexpected (by me at least I had to pinch my side to make sure I wasnt dreaming). When we got to the door she kissed me immediately. It felt so good and I didn't know what to do so I just placed my hands in her butt :-( she laughed a bit bc apparently I wasn't supposed to do that agad. We continued to make out by door until she pushed me gently to the couch. She sat on my lap and kissed my neck. By that time of course I was already hard. Hell, typing this makes me hard again. When Marina felt my pet she sat on it even harder :-( shetsrp

We made out a little more while dry humping. I couldn't help myself anymore so I slid my hand under her shirt and bra, then squeezed her left tit. Shit her nipple was like a baby's pinky. After making out, she took off her shirt and taught me how to undo her bra with one hand. It took me a few tries but as soon as I did I buried my face in her tits. First tits ever. She told me her size is 32B whatever. Anyway. Fuck. I sucked on her nipples so hard. Too hard apparently as she told me to do it gently. I loved licking her tits because she tells me what she wants, like the tongue pattern she likes.

Okay so we had to move to the next step. She stood up and knelt before me, unzipped my pants, and took out my dick. Fuck. I could still feel her hands wrapped around my dick. Without warning she put it in her mouth and oh so fuck it was glorious. Puta not to mention the sloppy blowjob sounds I used to hear in porn lang??? Fuck I'm hearing it live :((((((

Sorry I really don't know how to describe a blowjob. But it was so wet and shiiiit lang ang sarap. She told me she'll only stop when I come, but joke's on her I masturbate a lot. Try me. So the blowjob lasted for a long while, she was surprised I hadn't come yet so okay whatevs, she told me. Maybe her pussy could do the trick. Marina undressed completely and sat on my dick. I was still in the same position sitting at the couch. She was kinda playing with my dick, like aiming it to the opening of her vagina. I didn't even get to finger her because she was taking the lead and I'm not complaining. I knew she was alreay wet enough judging by her panties. So again, without warning, she inserted my penis on her vagina.

WHY THE FUCK IS PUSSY SO PLEASURABLY WARM???
I couldn't help but react so I hugged her tight while she continued to work her hips. Fuck it was so good. It was more like a dance than the up-down-up-down motion in porn. So there. While she was doing her thing, I was sucking her nipples again. Faaaaaak hearing a woman moan is so so so arousing.

After a while I told her I wanted to exchange positions, so she laid her back on the couch while it was my turn to fuck her. Vanilla postion. Holy shit it was so hot. I could still picture in my head how hot she looked as I held her hands above her head like as if she was tied up. Her tits bouncing was a majestic view, and her face in pleasure was the icing on the cake. Shit was nice. So nice.

When I told her I was about to cum, she asked me to keep going but give enough time so she can suck my cock while I release my load. So I did. And she sucked my penis while my potential babies are going out on a trip. And she continued doing that as if she wanted to drain all me semen. Fuck this feeling. I don't know how else to describe it other than that neil degrasse tyson when she still suck when u nut gif meme.

Fakity fak. My first fuck. And I was tired as hell.

The fuck was amazing, but honestly ~~russians~~ americans in general need to shower more often. Oh and I have a feeling we'll have a sequel later this week. I'm so hoping :((

This is all just so that I might have a lucrative career at like 28 or 29. I always feel scared. Nothing is certain and I am always trying to anticipate some curve ball I didn't see coming. I feel like an imposter playing at trying to be good at something. 

Even with progress, even with planning, I always remain scared of things going wrong. Many of the people I knew who graduated from college even with more technical degrees than mine struggle to find jobs. I'm just so scared. I feel like I should always be doing more. My therapist says that while I can plan for a lot of things, my anxiety makes me think of every negative outcome and it freezes me.

I just wish I could better handle the anxiety and work diligently on my future. Many days I feel like I'm sabotaging myself because I don't feel like I deserve to ever feel safe or happy or connected with anyone close. I have to be ""better"" to deserve it."
9b0yt9,3,2018-08-28,A dream I've had twice now.,UsernameRestrictions,creepypasta,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/9b0yt9/a_dream_ive_had_twice_now/,"I'm sure someone could make this into a more interesting story. I'm more or less just trying to tell someone about it, and I definitely can't tell my wife.

So a few months ago my wife went out of town on an internship and I was left alone to take care of the apartment and cats. During her two month leave I had two terrifying experiences that I've never had before. The first was a dream about her.
(I dont think this is NSFW because I'm not going into too much detail, correct me if I should)
When we have sex I enjoy chocking her and she enjoys being chocked. But in this dream I took it too far and ended up crushing her windpipe. I freaked the fuck out and passed around our room not knowing what the fuck to do or who to call. I think some time passed in my dream, maybe a few hours or maybe a day, but I ended up trying to hide what I did and threw her body in the community trash outside (you know, those big ones that garbage trucks lift up). In my dream I was never suspected of being the killer and no one even talked about her death, but the weight of what I had done was tearing my heart to pieces, even after I woke up my mind was racing. Why did I have that dream, what was I thinking, why did no one care about her dissapearance?!
Eventually I just felt relieved that it was over and it was just a dream. 
The days got closer to my wife's return, I think I had about a week and a half before she got home (keep in mind i havent been this depressed since I graduated from highschool and didnt know what I wanted to do with my life). This is the night I experienced my first sleep paralysis. It was just like everyone described it. Couldn't move, couldn't talk, and I was hard to even open both of my eyes. I wasnt aware of what was going on at first and as I looked around my dark room through only my left eye (I was lying my my right side and opening my left eye was a challenge) I noticed the silhouette of a woman at the end of my bed. I tried to ask who it was, but could only let out air. Then I tried to move and noticed I couldn't so I screamed and it came out as an inaudible whisper. This whole time the woman never looked at me, she just started unmoving into my closet. Once I realized it was sleep paralysis I calmed down and just let it run its course. I dont remember much after that, but as soon as I was able to move I sat up and messaged my step brother about it who told me all about sleep paralysis years ago when I wasnt a big deal.

I have never had SP since and wouldn't mind having it again because it was one hell of an experience.
But what I did have again was a continuation of my murder dream.

My wife is actually out of town again but not as long (she left two days ago and will be back in a few hours) and not as far away. But I think it might be a connection.

I just woke up so what I remember of this dream is a little foggy at best. But I was sitting in what I guess was my current college math class. I think some people around me were talking about someones death and I was feeling really paranoid about everything. Did they find her body? Do they know it was me? 
Then some official looking people walked into the room and I thought ""this is it I'm going to jail"". But nothing still. I just kept sitting there. Finally someone walked up to me and handed me a paper to sign, it looked like some release form or something, I'm not certain but it again pertained to someones death and what would happen to their belongings. Then next thing I knew they where all gone and I was still talking to the person with the form but now on my phone and I figured it was a scam call just trying to get information out of me so I hung up.

That's everything I have so far. After i woke up i felt an uncomfortable guilt and called my wife to tell her how much i loved her. Feels good to get this off my mind, now I can go back to playing video games before class."

It's a way for me to vent and get it all out of my system, after years of living with it. I hope some of it is relatable for people in the same boat. I only found this subreddit a few weeks ago, and it genuinely saved me from more agony and pain. Finally things make sense. I hope this can help other people.

​

I used to be a big gamer, and 4 years ago (2014) I met this girl online. She lived in another continent, and I just got out of a 5 year long relationship, so I wasn't looking for anything and neither was she, since she had a boyfriend. We became great friends who played and chatted for months. During this time, she told me about her abusive boyfriend. How he never pays any attention to her, doesn't care about her, only wants her for sex,... She told me her dad was emotionally abusive too, and would never believe her when she told him things. She hated her mother, didn't have any friends, quit high school a few years prior, and generally didn't go out much. After a couple of months she broke up with her boyfriend, saying he was a loser. We continued playing and chatting for a long time. After about a year (2015), we decided to meet up. I flew out to meet her and we had a wonderful weekend. After that, we decided to be exclusive and give this long distance thing a chance. I flew out a bunch of times to where she lived and we always had a great time. She was pretty jealous, regulary deleting and ghosting mutual friends that were female, but I didn't think much of it at the time. I kept reassuring her that she had nothing to worry about. One day, when I got home from work, I had a ton of messages from her and some of our mutual friends, saying she had been in a car accident. She crashed her car into a brick building on an abandoned road. Luckily she was fine, but the car was totaled. I wanted to fly out and be there for her, but since my dad also recently had an accident and fell into a coma, I couldn't. She got super angry and kept telling me I didn't care about her.  A mutual friend told me he thought she crashed her car on purpose. When I brought this up with her, she accused me of cheating on her. She told me I never cared about her, that I never listen, that I always make her feel like shit and make everything worse for her. I tried everything I could, but she wouldn't have any of it and ghosted me.

​

5 months passed when she suddenly reached out (2016). I immediately apologized for my shitty behaviour and she told me she was sorry for freaking out so much. We started talking again and slowly picked things up from where we left off. Meanwhile, my dad's situation was getting worse and worse,  so I still couldn't leave the country. I explained this to her and she understood. One day, when I was at the hospital, I got a text from her, asking why I was cheating on her. I explained, again, that I wasn't. The following weeks after that she became super distant, only to do a 180 every other day. She told me she hated her little rural town, there's nothing to do, the people suck, her family sucks,... I asked her if she wanted to come stay with me. She was overjoyed and we began planning her move. A few days later, she suddenly stopped replying to my messages. Then she became very cold, telling me I never did anything for her and that I always make everything worse for her. She told me she quit her job because her manager was an asshole, and now didn't have any money to pay for rent. She said she was completely fucked. I felt so sorry for her. This girl I loved was clearly in a lot of trouble and I thought she might be depressed, so offered to pay for her car insurance and rent. She told me no one has ever helped her before and she didn't know how to deal with it, so she just never mentioned it again.

​

A few weeks later, she was supposed to come here, but suddenly changed her mind. She needed me to show her that I truly cared, otherwise she was worried I was just gonna stand her up at the airport. We agreed that I'd fly out for another weekend to be with her. That week my dad died. I called her, told her what happened. She asked me if this meant that I couldn't come over, said “okay” and hung up. Didn't hear from her for three days, while I was making funeral arrangements. I thought her depression was turning her into a cold, distant shell of a person and felt incredibly sorry for her. I kept apologizing for things I didn't do, but as the weeks went on, she got increasingly hostile and aggressive. During one of her worst days, she told me she stopped eating and was starving. She told me she didn't want to live anymore. I was stuck on the other side of the world, dealing with my own family troubles, so I did the one thing I knew I could do: I contacted her dad. I didn't tell him much, only that I was very worried since she stopped eating and asked him if he would check up on her. He was super friendly and told me mentall illness runs in the family. We said goodbye and that was it. I didn't hear from her for a week, even though I kept calling, texting, begging her to please tell me if she was alright. When she finally decided to answer, she told me I broke her trust in the worst way possible and that I'm completely crazy. She started telling our mutual friends that I contacted her family out of the blue, to tell them nonsense about her and made them worried for no reason. I was devastated, since all I wanted was for her to be okay and didn't have any bad intentions. A few days later she did a 180 and came around. She never mentioned my dad or asked how I was dealing with it all, but she wanted to talk again, and for some reason that was enough for me. We pretended like nothing bad ever happened.

​

After a few more weeks, I finally dealt with all my legal business and other family affairs, so we started discussing moving again. She wanted me to come there, so I started looking for jobs in the area. Moving to another continent, is not very practical, so I needed to find a company that would hire me. I found this investement firm, and started an intership with the goal to ship to their branch close to where she lives. I had to do this internship for 6 months, before I was allowed to move. During this time, she got increasingly hostile. Some days she wouldn't talk to me at all. I regulary asked her if she was sure that she wanted me to come over. Every time I did, she got furious, told me I always make her feel like shit and that she wants nothing more than for me to be there, since she needs me and is a complete wreck.

​

April 2017, I finally completed my internship and had everything in order. We found a decent apartment in a major city close to her, and I was ready to move. A few hours before I got on the plane, I suddenly got an email from her, saying she had second thoughts and needed some time for herself. She said she met some friends online who lived in another state, 3000 miles away, and was going to visit them for a while. When my plane landed, I had no idea what to do with myself. I got to my new apartment, in this city in a continent where I didn't know anyone. I tried calling her, but she didn't pick up. The next day, I woke up, to find myself ghosted from everything. Deleted from all social media, it was like I never existed. My new job started the next day so I didn't have time to think about things and had to go through the motions. I obsessively refreshed her instagram page every hour, until one day, a picture popped up of her and her new boyfriend. It was one of the friends she told me about before. I knew some of them, so I asked them what the hell was going on. They told me she told them I was abusive, that I cheated on her, wasn't good to her, and only took advantage of her. I was devastated hearing this, since I truly loved this girl and would never do anything to hurt her.

​

Months passed, and one day, I suddenly got a call from an unknown number. This guy on the other end, told me he met this girl a while back, and after talking for a few months, she started saying she couldn't pay her rent anymore and asked him to help her out. He said he heard her talking about me to her friends and even linked my social to them. That's how he found my number. I told him the entire story and he said he knew something was up, since the same thing happened to him, with the one exception that he cut her off when she started telling him all these sobstories. When we hung up, I felt a little bit better, knowing I wasn't completely crazy, but still felt like shit. A few more days passed, when I suddenly got another call. It was her. She was crying. She told me not to believe anything the other guy has said, that he was a creepy stalker who she never even met and tried to get away from. She sounded so genuine and sincere. I believed her. We talked all night. She told me she flew out to this new city to be with her new boyfriend, but he immediately signed up for the military and had to leave for bootcamp a few weeks after she arrived. She was all alone, miserable and depressed, which made her do incredibly impulsive things. She said she was incredibly sorry, made a huge mistake and asked me to come visit her to find out if we still had a chance. She was in a relationship, and I didn't want to be a rat, so I declined and told her to break up first. She got furious and told me I exist of nothing but broken promises. She asked me what the hell I've ever done for her. I didn't respond. The next day, she did a 180. Told me she'll always love me very much, that she's gonna leave her new boyfriend and come home. She added me back on all platforms, and we started talking again. She asked me questions about this new city I was living in, asked me if I liked it, wanted to see pics,... She seemed so genuine. She told me she was looking at flights to finally come home. We talked all day and night, until a few days later, I woke up one morning to find myself ghosted again. Deleted from all social media. She didn't respond to my texts or calls. I obsessively started refreshing her social media again. A few hours later a few pictures popped up. She went on a roadtrip with her boyfriend's family and picked him up from bootcamp. Five pictures of them kissing and laughing. This completely broke me. That day, I quit my job, sold all my stuff, and got out of there as soon as possible, back home.

​

Weeks passed. I wasn't doing well at all. I couldn't for the life of me understand why anyone would do this? What was there to gain? Was she really just an inherently bad person? I loved her so much, and some days that most definitely seemed to be mutual, so what the hell happened? Did her car crash cause some kind of brain disfunction? Perhaps I really was just a crazy asshole? Maybe I deserved this? I talked about all of this with my friends for weeks. They were very supportive and quite frankly saved my life. Then one day, I suddenly got a text. She said her boyfriend left for training and she didn't know what to do. I told her that I didn't understand what she was trying to pull. She called me, crying. She told me she was incredibly sorry. That she never meant for any of this. That I can't be mad at her or leave. That she needs me. We talked all night. She told me she had been to a therapist, but that he didn't help her at all. That her boyfriend wasn't supportive, that she doesn't love him, that she can't find a job, has no money, that she has a lot of anxiety and panic attacks,... I genuinely thought this poor girl was going through something horrible. She must have been very depressed. I asked her if she would please go back to her therapist, since he would be able to help her for sure. She got furious again. Told me I always make everything worse, never listen to her, and that she's just going to settle for never being happy. She deleted me of everything again. It still hurt a lot, but it didn't phase me as much as the months before.

​

The next 8 months (2018) got increasingly better, since I stopped obssesively checking her social. After moving back home, I bought my dad's old house, moved in, got a new job, regulary went out with my friends and genuinely started to enjoy life again. Three weeks ago, she suddenly contacted me again. She told me she was super sorry. She knew she fucked up. Her boyfriend was deployed and left her all on her own. She told me he never listens to her, he bores he, he dragged her to this shitty military town where all the people suck, where she can't find a normal job, … During this phonecall, I checked her social for the first time in 8 months. I immediately stumbled upon one of her wedding pics. I asked her why she didn't tell me she got married. Why she feels the need to come back just to lie again.  She started crying harder. Told me she only married for the health care, that she was gonna leave him, that she had nowhere to go, that she was miserable, depressed, had a lot of anxiety and panick attacks,... I told her to go. She said ""alright"" and deleted me again. It felt like a giant weight got lifted of my shoulders.

​

For the first time since this entire giant mess started 4 years ago, I decided to google some of these antics. “My ex keeps coming back with sobstories.”. I randomly stumbled upon this thread: [https://i.imgur.com/ZtVUegl.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/ZtVUegl.jpg) . My jaw dropped to the floor. All these 18 points were literally what happened to me these past couple of years. Every single one of them. I found this subreddit. Suddenly everything makes sense. After years of feeling like complete horeshit, of feeling like I was some kind of abusive asshole, of feeling like I was crazy, everything finally clicked. Incredible. I hope people who are still doubting themselves or their situation can read this, and know they're not alone. I wish I found this subreddit years ago. It legit saved me from years of more agony and wondering what the hell is going on."

Arlington within a mile of metro for me and my wife (late 20s). I feel like we've looked at everything on Craigslist and its been hard to find something meeting the following requirements:

* &gt; 700 square feet
* &lt; 1 mile walk to metro
* Under $2k w/ parking included
* free off-street parking or parking for 2 cars under $150
* washer/dryer in unit

I realize we might just be too picky, but any suggestions/help is greatly appreciated. We both drive to work, so ditching the cars is not an option. My wife does frequently have to metro into DC to visit sites for work though. S. Arlington/Alexandria would also make my commute to Dulles much worse. 

We've primarily looked on Craigslist, but also looked on HotPads and called a few major management companies (Dittmar, AVA, Equity, etc.). We're trying to move-in late Sept/early October and I have generally been surprised that units are not more affordable in the fall, since interns are no longer in the area. "

I would really love some advice to alleviate stress induced from overworking.

​

I have been working at a financial trading company for the past 5 months as an intern. For those of you that don't know, trading is what I would term an adrenaline-pumped high pressure environment. I work around 50 hours per week on average, and when it's crunch season it goes up to 60-65 and beyond. I'm also made to work most weekends. When I was in school, I had the typical college kid lifestyle: I would stay up until around 3 or 4, wake up around 10 or so and head to class (and sometimes skip class if I don't feel like it). But now, I wake up around 6 and I'm at work until around 6. I pound around 6-7 espresso shots on average to power through a normal day. After I get back from work, I go back to college where I take a class for 3 hours, then go home and study a little before passing out and the loop repeats.

​

I've been going to the gym regularly, but as time progressed at work, I've realized that my appetite has dropped significantly. I've also been having rampant sleep issues, where I cannot sleep properly unless I use melatonin(2-3 pills a night)/other sleeping pills. Most of the time these past couple weeks, melatonin has been failing too.

​

This whole change of lifestyle is causing me to feel tired all the time even if I get rest. I feel so exhausted, physically all the time it's just hard to do anything once I get home. Coupled with a bunch of personal issues I've been having, it's a huge shitshow, physically as well as mentally. The stress at work has also made me pick up smoking, something I had a wild disgust for, previously.

​

While I initially hated it, I kind of got sucked into this lifestyle (what a classic case of Stockholm syndrome) and now I can't seem to shake it off me. I'll be back in school in 3 weeks, and I'm worried about how I would transition into normal, every day life. Is there anything you guys in similar situations do to ease the burden on your body physically as well as mentally? Any specific mental exercises, meditation etc. ? I try meditation, but I can't get myself to focus since my mind keeps drifting to some thought or the other, usually work or school."

##How The Chart Works:

These charts are created based on how frequently each song appears in the top 10 songs/albums for all of the users signed up for the chart. If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurrence, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for the last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each.

9b2zpu,2,2018-08-28,Owed money from part-time employment with no written contract,ThrowAPooAway,UKPersonalFinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/9b2zpu/owed_money_from_parttime_employment_with_no/,"Hi guys, not sure if this is the right place to post this so if anyone has any suggestions of a better sub please let me know!

I did some work a couple of years ago as part of a summer internship program. I was promised £100 per day for 4 weeks. Ended up doing 4 weeks + 2 days and was paid accordingly. Fine.

It was then agreed that I would continue working for this company (the ""company"" was essentially two guys, with me being the only person actually working on the project at the time), and I would be paid at the same rate. No contract was written up (mistake no.1) - the agreement was simply that I would keep working over the summer, logging my time in a spreadsheet and getting paid at the same rate as before. Mistake no.2 is that I wasn't in massive need of the money at the time and so didn't end up asking for payment until I had racked up £4000 work of time worked. This was a bit of a shock to the guy who was meant to pay me since he'd been awful at keeping in contact whilst I was working there. Because of this, there had also been a misunderstanding in how much money he supposedly had available to pay me. He had planned a maximum of £1000 (which he gave to me), but had never actually told me that that was the limit and so I did a lot more work than that (totalling £4000).

Ever since then, I've repeatedly emailed and tried to call this guy to sort out the situation. Most of the time he's completely blanked me. Over a year has passed now and I'm still owed the money. From what I understand, I should have some sort of legal standing in that we had a verbal agreement (even though bits were implied), but I have no idea where to go from here. The other guy in the company is on my side, and he provided me with the address of the guy who should be paying me; he suggested I write a formal letter and invoice and simply threaten legal action if no payment is made soon. He also said that he is planning to follow up on any action I take.

Does anyone have any idea what I can do and how I can go about doing it? Or if I even have any legal standing in the matter.

Cheers!"

I just started my Fall internship at Glenn Research Center doing machine learning work for satellite communications and I can’t contain my excitement. I’m a junior undergrad who’s wanted to work in space for many years now and this is a dream come true. Every day I go to work for a a place that put the first people on the moon, snapped a selfie of Earth from millions of miles away, and taught us all our true place in the universe. Safe to say, my life is amazing.

For anyone out there dreaming of working at NASA or in the space industry in general, you can do it. The road isn’t easy and you’ll have to wake up every day passionate and motivated but in the end it will pay off. At times the past year I started to feel like all my hard work was in vain as rejection after rejection came in. I wanted to throw in the towel and go work at McDonalds for the rest of my life because, we’ll “at least they’ll hire me.” 

Yet, here I am having the time of my life not 6 months later. 

Don’t ever give in to the voice telling you to quit. 

P.S: feel free to PM me if you have any questions about my journey so far or how I got where I am! I’m happy to provide any advice I can.

9b3g2u,5,2018-08-28,Interpretation of PCA,BananaMain,statistics,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/9b3g2u/interpretation_of_pca/,"Hey all,

I am an engineering student with limited background in statistics. I would be hyper-appreciative of any help I could get on this subject! I am well enough versed in linear algebra to understand singular values, orthogonal matricies, SVD, etc.. I am doing this project on an internship, so unfortunately I don't have any academic support.

I'm currently working on a problem where I am given three outputs based on four variables with 2064 experiments, so I have seven columns yielding a 2064x7 matrix. I have performed PCA in MATLAB which yielded seven principle components. I recognize by the cumulative ratios of singular values to the sum of singular values that 81% of the variance is captured in the first two principal component vectors.

Taking PC1 for example:

PC1 = \[-0.0005,  -0.3375,  -0.5084,  -0.3578,  -0.0016,  -0.0095,  0.7068\]

which corresponds to variables x1, x2, x3, and x4, with outputs y1, y2, y3.

&amp;#x200B;

My interpretation of this is that output y3 is most strongly affected by inputs x2, x3, and x4, while output y1 and y1 are only weakly affected and variable x1 is essentially irrelevant. Is this the right idea?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you!"

My courses include finance, data science, computer science, and mathematics.  On top of implementing my own algos on personal projects, I am looking for some guidance on picking internships. I have three built into the program i'm in. The first one I was thinking Data Science (open to critique), but i'm at a loss of what specialities would prove most valuable for the final two.

9b3x74,2,2018-08-28,My[23F] coworker[27F] gets easily frustrated with me and I don't know how to handle it,mstrashpie,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9b3x74/my23f_coworker27f_gets_easily_frustrated_with_me/,"My coworker has the same title as me. She has 3 years experience so she's definitely has seniority on me. In the beginning, I thought she was cool because she was always so open and seemed lighthearted. She seemed excited to have me on the team when I first got hired (6 mos ago), and I felt like she was the only person who I could count on for tips with my job. As time went on, I realized that she could be a really passive aggressive person.

Bad things: 
- Hypercritical. She talks about everyone's mistakes, and makes it a ""thing"". If Sharon couldn't find something she needed for a report on the system she was using to print XYZ report, she'll mutter to himself, ""Wow, Sharon, really? Jeez."" after helping her out. 
- She complains a lot, like if someone's perfume is too strong, or if an intern just isn't ""getting"" it because the intern's being too earnest/nitpicky in his tasks 
- Lots of sighing -
 Want an opinion? Cause I've got a load of 'em!
- Sarcastic

Good things: She can be self-deprecating and admit her mistakes. So she isn't a know it all, but can act like one

Today, I needed to get a new wireless mouse for my computer. I asked her where to get them. She gives me directions, says that they're in the inventory room and they're in the ""secret cabinet"", whatever that means. I ask, ""what cabinet?"" And she says, ""you know, the big one in the back.""

I am not very familiar with the inventory room and it's relatively big. 
I went to the most obvious cabinet, and with the key I was given, it opened. Easy peasy.

Nothing is labeled clearly in the cabinet. A bunch of old technology, printers, etc. Still, I'm not seeing any small boxes that would hold a mouse. Looking around for labels, there are none. I didn't feel comfortable moving stuff around, so I didn't. I scanned the cabinet about 5 times. I gave up.

I went back, and said to her, ""I couldn't find it, sorry"" in a normal tone of voice. Maybe I should have asked more nicely for her to go look for me.

She's like, hmm, weird, I was certain they were in there. At this point, I should have offered to check again.

A few minutes later, she comes back with the mouse. She drops, not places, the mouse on my desk and says ""it was literally right there in the cabinet"". Doesn't crack a smile. I apologize.

Apparently it was in one of the larger boxes.

A few minutes later, she cracks a joke about how I can't find things.
If I were her, I would have been ROLLING my eyes at me, internally. I get it! But to purposefully act passive aggressive with a co-worker? Probably not. I should have looked more thoroughly. I was getting flashbacks to when my mom scolded me for not looking hard enough for stuff.

I'm an idiot.

Am I being too sensitive? She clearly will forget about this, but something felt really off about how she gave me the mouse. My biggest concern is that I may not be speaking up. I feel like it could be really easy for her to walk all over me if I just accept her passive-aggressive behavior. Maybe it was justified?

TL;DR: My coworker can be subtly rude sometimes. Today I asked for help to look for something. Gave me directions, I couldn't find them, so she had to. Whoops! She made it clear that I caused her grief over this. Any advice?"

I recently graduated from college in May and although I am planning to go to grad school for human ergonomics and human factors, I am taking a few months to take more classes and gain some experience. However, I constantly feel like I'm stagnant. Although I have an upcoming art/design showcase and may have possibilities to network with people in the field, I am conflicted as to what to do next.

I've applied for a few internships and I'm taking more design classes to broaden my knowledge but I'm lost as to what class would be useful for me. I am debating on whether on taking Life Span psychology or an Intro to Computer science course that focuses primarily on spreadsheets, terminology and operating systems. My mentor suggested that I start designing things on my own, speak to people from the programs I am interested in, etc.

I have been in contact with someone that may have me do some research for him when needed and I have proposed my own algorithm based on my observations with fashion online retail stores. 

Can someone provide me with some advice? I feel like I'm stagnant. "
9b4qpx,0,2018-08-28,"Me [24F] with my boyfriend[24M] I can’t decide where to live due to mental health, relationship, and being a recent grad",Saraisa23,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9b4qpx/me_24f_with_my_boyfriend24m_i_cant_decide_where/,"I [24F] just graduated from a highly ranked university in NYC. I am originally from Miami. I have been with my boyfriend (24M) for 4 years. Sorry in advance for how long this is.  

- School was tough and city life didn’t end up being what I thought it would. I was depressed throughout my studies due to my school’s competitive nature, financial issues, health problems, seasonal depression and the culture shock between SOFL and NYC.

-when I couldn’t afford rent anymore after finishing my fellowship my boyfriend really pushed to move in with me to help. I didn’t feel ready and wanted to just move to a cheaper place or an hour out of the city with my sister or cousins while I applied for work. He wouldn’t take no for an answer and started giving ultimatums. I felt backed into a corner financially and emotionally and eventually caved. 

-we lived together in a studio for 3 months and everything changed. The city already depressed me greatly for various reasons and I started to notice things about my bf that made me feel manipulated and trapped. He’s always been a little brash, but it came out in ugly ways when we lived together. I started to withdraw from him physically and intimately. Many times I would just go along with sex only to end up feeling violated and soon I just stopped altogether. He would interrupt my sleep at 3 am to talk about our problems, he started to talk down to me and put down things about me like how I dress, talk or my personality. He would get annoyed y my health problems and admitted its hard for him to empathize with people. I had a disastrous graduation weekend when my family’s hotel plans fell through and when I wanted them to stay with us while they figured out a new plan my boyfriend was hostile to them and complained the two nights they stayed. And for some reason, I went along with all this. I became increasingly depressed and suicidal. Every day I went to work retail I daydreamed about throwing myself onto the train tracks. I kept getting rejected after job interviews and NYC felt even more hopeless. I felt like I lost my sense of self and I was just a body merely existing. 

-I finally realized something needed to change and I wanted to go home. It was like pulling teeth but I got my bf to agree and thankfully we were on a month to month lease. He admitted that he manipulated me to move in together because he was afraid I’d go back to FL after graduating. We both cried a lot the day I left and I said I didn’t know when I’d be back but I would be. Well, I’m in FL now and it’s like night and day. I feel like I woke up from a nightmare and I can finally exhale. I’ve been working on my portfolio passionately now and feel like I would ace interviews now. I previously had a great summer internship here in Miami at a large company. I’ve kept in touch with several people. Everyone really liked me and I worked between two departments. I want to apply there for anything they might have. I also have connections at a few other companies through classmates and mentors that I think I would impress. I just don’t know how to tell my boyfriend. I said I'd be back but I can’t imagine going back to a similar situation. He wants us to live in an apartment his mom will soon be evicting a tenant from. I’ve only been back 2 weeks and he’s asking me when I’ll be back. Saying he’s depressed and is barely eating or sleeping. I feel horrible that he feels this way but I haven't felt this great in years. I want to try long distance. Despite everything that transpired the past few months, he’s a great guy but he needs to mature in many ways as do I before we try living together again. I feel ready to get my foot into the industry but I’m holding myself back from taking that step thinking about what he wants. 
_____________________________________________________
TL;DR Just graduated. NYC was too competitive and depressing. Had a tumultuous living situation with my long-term boyfriend after he admittedly manipulated me into living together. Got very depressed with suicidal ideations. Went back to FL with the intention of it being temporary. Can't imagine going back to NYC again and want to start working in my industry here. Don't know how to tell boyfriend and feeling held back from taking the next step. "

The firm has a great reputation, is hard to get into, and I've had very positive interactions with all the attorneys I've met from the firm. However, I was at a 1L SA at another BigLaw firm and while I enjoyed the experience to a certain degree, I think I could tell that BigLaw wasn't something I wanted to make a career out of. I came to the conclusion over the summer that my stint in any BigLaw job probably would probably end with me going in house after 2-5 years. The work-life balance concerns became apparent to me over the summer; even as a SA I could feel the stress of the job. 

&amp;#x200B;

The in house option pays around 85% of what the BigLaw job would pay starting out and would result in a much better work-life balance. I'm concerned that it may provide me less experience as BigLaw would, but if my end goal is to go in-house eventually, why not go directly to an in-house opportunity?

Is there a way for me to cure his weed now? It tastes pretty good out of my dry herb vape, solid flavor, but it defiantly has some hay flavor, and it is a bit harsh. I’ve repacked it all out of ziplocks and into in several quart mason jars with boveda packs. Should I add some water to the jars?

I've been studying Computer Science for a year and a half right now, but I'm not really feeling it like I was in the few first months. I, however, noticed a thing that I don't share with my peers - I have neither passion for what I'm doing nor ambition in life.

They always seem to be talking about internships, they always seem to be actually involved with the assignments we are given and they always seem to be studying by themselves. I don't; I feel dumb to the point of calling myself a ""dumb, dumb, dumb fox.""

The certainty that I'll have to take part in seminars in one of the subjects (and the fact I'll have to defend a monograph/dissertation in some years (which I MUST do right before graduating)) also probably contributed to how I'm feeling right now.

A fun fact: I wouldn't have the courage to say all this in person to a psychologist or anyone I know in person.

Anyway, I have had these feelings for some weeks already and I feel like quitting. I legit stopped giving fucks to the harder assignments.

""So, what's the problem?""

My parents are going to force me to work if I quit college. And working doesn't seem to be a pleasurable thing to do. Heck, I don't even understand how working ended up like this.

Sure, it is not the end of the world and it feeds our hobbies and passions, but what if I have none besides wasting my day playing games? I won't ever make a living out of that.

I was told I ""still have time to find out"" what I want to do with my life, but here's the catch: I think I'm too afraid to both make mistakes (thus wasting effort) and go out of my ""comfort"" bubble and I get extremely frustrated when they happen to the point of shutting down.

I fear it might take way too long for me to find out. I fear it might be just unfeasible to make a living out of it. I fear I might not even find out the path I want to take. I fear I might not even find a 'good enough' job with an empty CV (I swear I have done *nothing* in 19 years.)

Oddly enough, I seem kind of unable to cry, despite wanting to - haven't cried since one of my grandfathers passed away back in early 2010.

I feel I'm just stuck in life thanks to my refusal to get help and change (hopefully) for the better. I feel I'm paralyzed by the demons inside my head, by the (stupid?) hatred I have regarding work and by the uncertainty that I have torwards my near future. I feel maybe overwhelmed by all the things that could go either right or wrong.

I feel (nearly) hopeless."

I never had a problem with weed. That i know of anyway. Long story short it has been there to celebrate all my successes. When i was in college I smoked maybe 4 out of 7 nights of the week. I had no issue i could even take a break in the lead up to exams to focus on study, no issues. I even felt motivated to look for internships after getting high because I always thought ""well if im getting high i better get my shit together."" 

Same thing when i graduated. I would apppy for five jobs before doing my wake n bake just to stay on top. Didnt take me long to receive a decent offer for what i thought was my dream job.

When i started working full time i could easily control my usage to just weekends and function as an adult diring the week. Now here's where things get tricky. I ended up deciding the job wasnt for me and left. I had an entrepreneurial spark and realised i never ever enjoyed working under someone else. As soon as i quit i was smart enough to take a break from weed to sort things out. Found a sales job to practice sales skills and this started by first daily smoking but only in the evening.

Flash forward to me running my own online business and travelling. I was off weeed for about 6 months (aside from a few joints in cambodia during one week). When i came back home i was smoking around the same as college every few nights and a week long stretch here and there.

Finally i moved into a new place with just my girlfriend and I. First time since having my own business and working from home in my own country. There have been just a handful of sober nights either when im out of weed on make an effort to cut back. Other than that it's been every day for the past few months. Not during the day fortunately except over the weekend  (a little rule i set myself).

I want to cut back but not for any real reasons. Just that the high is better with a day or two in between but i can barely make it one night without. Other than that i have no other issues. I still work hard, im good financially, relationships are intact. Weed doesnt seem to have any detriment on my life yet i cant shake the habit because i really do enjoy it. 

I dont know whether it is worth making an effort or if i should just enjoy it until i see a valid reason to quit. Am i kidding myself or do i have a silent problem that will show itself when things take a turn for the worse?"

So I walked the stage in May and planned to finish my 2 units of internship during the summer. It was $750 but they wouldn’t let me register because they said I was too late. I changed my graduation date to fall 2018 but now I have to pay $2,719 for 2 units of internship. Pretty fucking pissed I gotta pay for an internship. Was wondering what you guys would recommend?"

Looking for some perspective, I'm an electrical engineering / computer science undergrad with two years down, currently working an internship with the electrical design team at a power engineering firm. I have a previous internship at a semi-state aviation company (working on the telecommunication systems used between the pilots and air traffic controllers). I also spent a month in a financial clearing firm working with derivatives in London (this was when I realised that I liked business and finance far more than engineering) and I worked as a door to door salesman selling electricity contracts for two months I had off. My results are decent, I hope to finish up with either first or second class honours. I'm studying for the CFA while working my internship full time. I hope to have CFA level 1 in my back pocket in December, then forgetting about it while I finish my final year and a half of my undergrad. I'm going to apply for internships at energy trading firms for this coming summer. Then I plan to do a masters in finance at either a top school here in Europe or an Ivy League in the US, hopefully being able to sit the CFA level 2 while studying.

I want to work in commodities trading at a bulge bracket, specifically in energy. Do you think this is a good plan, how relevant is the CFA for achieving this goal?

Thank you"

9b8dn9,24,2018-08-29,[UPDATE v2] Highton's Soul Knight Character Tier List (v1.8.5),HightonACG,SoulKnight,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoulKnight/comments/9b8dn9/update_v2_hightons_soul_knight_character_tier/,"# Introduction

The  big question: Who is the best character in the game? The one who is  most effective in game? Who gets to the stone most commonly?

After  some time and careful analysis (nearing 200 hours and 80 completes), I  have compiled an easy to use list on which characters I consider to be  the best. A list like this can never satisfy everyone, as player skill  and personal preference can influence how good/bad a character is.  However, I will provide explanation for each character and will be happy  to answer any questions. Here goes:

*(Note:  I speak about above- and below-average stats. Average HP is 6, Armor is  5, Energy is 187 (rounded to 200) and Melee Damage is 4. As well, this  list refers to characters that have been upgraded to Max Level and have  obtained their starting buff. Characters are also ordered inside of  their Tier.)*

# S-Tier

*(The best of the best. Characters here I consider to be a cut above the rest.)*

\-  1. Knight. Innocuous, boring, possessing a newly gargantuan mouth.  These are the only downsides to Knight. Above average Health and Armor,  as well as objectively the best starting buff already make him top-tier  material. The deal is sealed, however, by his simple-but deadly Skill:  Dual Wield. The ability to temporarily double your DPS is invaluable in  both rooms and against bosses, and its effectiveness is only bettered by  its Level 5 upgrade, which allows it to last for much longer, as long  as you can keep consistently getting kills (Which makes it busted in  Badass Mode). Easily the best character to date.

\-  2. Robot. As soon as this absolute \*\*\*\*ing unit, as well as his hefty  cost, landed in the game I knew this boy was going to be busted.  Although his Health is a little low for my taste, his great armor and  absolutely busted Skill catapult him into the S-Tier. Electric Overload  is, without question, the most powerful skill in the game. It clears  rooms, it damages bosses, it clears crates, it costs nothing and it gets  you laid (not really). This ability, as well as hit 7 base armor pretty  much guarantees him a place in with the best.

\-  3. Paladin. I'm guessing the Chillyroom team (the legends) were sitting  in a big conference room with a whiteboard at the end reading 'NEW  CHARACTER IDEA'. After some thought and many scrapped ideas, an intern  walks in an writes in big letters '9 ARMOR AND TEMPORARY INVINCIBILITY'.  Silence for a few seconds... then the lead designer shouts 'BRILLIANT!  LET'S GET ON IT! Jenkins, see me in my office to discuss a promotion.'  Paladin's sheer survivability puts him in the S-Tier, since he just  ignores bloody well everything the monsters can throw at him and dish  most of it back with his newly regained energy. Definitely worth the 1  USD.

# A-Tier

*(They're strong, they're fast. Playing them is certainly a blast.)*

\-  4. Alchemist. Average overall, nothing really too special. That  statement, however, is ignoring his Skill. The Poison Bottles provide  supreme room control and, unlike some other characters, still remains  relevant all the way through to 3-5. Fits well into A-Tier, but missing  that crucial little bit that would move him into S-Tier.

\-  5. Assassin. What happened bro? Before the tragedy that was his  skill change he was right up there with Knight and Paladin, chillin' in  the S-Tier Jacuzzi, sipping on a bottle filled with the tears of the  myriad of bosses he had slain. But after the change he's fallen from  grace. His boss survivability, one of the most important statistics for  any character, has dropped significantly, lowering him down to A-Tier.  All this being said, Assassin is still very strong, with Dark Blade now  much more adept at clearing rooms (not that he had trouble previously).  Hopefully he'll be restored to his former glory some time in the future  (Chillybois plz)

\-  6. Rogue. So after a solid 12 hours of straight play, and some previous experience, I finally understand why people fanboy around Rogue. Although his playstyle is much more  unconventional, requiring you to jump before every shot in order to  benefit from hit Critical Hit Chance boost.  However, the large amount of I-Frames he gets every jump, as well as the synergy between the Assassin Statue boost his survivability by a huge chunk. Although I previously put him in B-Tier, I have learned the error of my ways and he now lives at the top of A-Tier, where he really belongs.

\- 7. Priest. If only, if  only, Priest had the stats of Werewolf... Low Health, weak melee and  terrible starting buff... So why is she in A-Tier? As long as you have  even a sliver of Health, you're at full. Low armor? Nope, full in half  the time. Followers only have 1 HP bar? Nah, they're bloody unkillable  now. As well, probably the best Multiplayer character. Above average  energy is nice, but nothing too special. Fun synergy with her namesake  statue, as the energy restore sigil now fill to the edge of the full  glyph.

\- 8. Elf. Now Elf went through a  bit of a strange picking process. At first, she was low B-Tier due to  average stats and mediocre skill. However, after learning how to  actually play her properly I understood she was a solid A-Tier pick. Her  defensive vines refresh with every kill, allowing you to play a  minigame I call Turret Knight, in which you enter a room with a high RoF  weapon, put the phone down with your finger on the Fire button and go  watch a movie. Elf's playstyle is a bit finicky, but definitely strong  in the right hands. If you need to quote this list, Elf can be treated  as A-Minus Tier.

# B-Tier

*(Bad stats, unique quirk? Either way, they'll need some work.)*

\-  9. Vampire. I like to use a comparison to talk about Vampire. Vampire's  bats and buff are like a garden hose, but Vampire himself is a small  puddle. You can refill it quickly, but there's simply not that much to  refill. In order to play my visually favorite hero to his full  potential, you need to get the Max Health, No Extra Damage on Shield  Break AND Armor +1 buffs in the run. He could have been much higher if  his stats also were.

\- 10. Wizard. Wizard  is amazing for rooms. Bosses? Nowhere near. She has the highest energy  in the game, but he ability to stay alive against Bosses, where your  energy pool matters most is sadly lacking. If she had more Health she  would easily be in A-Tier. That being said, Wizard's kit is very strong  for the pre-boss room grind. Her Lightning Bolts can carve large chunks  of squishy enemies away, leaving you some breathing room for focusing  the bigger enemies *\*cough Big Skeleton cough\* .*  Unfortunately, the Bolts also trail off quite significantly in the  later stages, since the inital 8-through-12 damage strikes may just not  be strong enough to one-shot your targets. Overall, Wizard is strong,  but missing just a little bit of survivability she needs to have to be  in a higher Tier.\* (Side note: This might be a little biased, since I  really love playing Wizard and have the most playtime on her.\*)

\-  11. Berserker. Oh boy was I wrong. Initially this character was placed in the F-Tier (no longer existent), but after seeing his potential in both single and multiplayer, I can see that my first judgment was so far away from his true power. However, to bring this raw strength to the table, he'll need some support. If you can find a good RoF weapon (e.g. M4 or Shotgun Galaxy) we can sweep rooms quicker than an angry janitor (Janitor character when? Character idea coming in next post).

\-  12. Engineer. So let's take Alchemist, but remove the things that  made him OP and replace it with a mediocre gun and Flame Immunity. Say  hello to Engineer, a character that's so violently average he's kinda  bad. Rather than having a specific falling about himself, he's just  overall not the best, and Alchemist is inherently better (and doesn't  cost Mulah). Until Engineer gets himself a kit upgrade he's locked into  the bottom of B-Tier. *(Side note: Flame Shield is a great buff for Multiplayer. As such, in Multiplayer he can be treated as A-Tier)*

# C-Tier

*(Could've done well, if not some fatal flaw. These heroes will leave you wanting something more.)*

\-  13. Druid. At first, I thought Rogue required some special strategy to  be viable. Then I met Druid. An incredibly awkward stat line, low  energy, strange skill, you get the picture. Druid isn't bad per se, but  it requires a lot of getting used to. As well, the Druid playstyle isn't  easily transferable to other characters. If (s)he had more Armor, or a  way to regain Health aside from the Vampiric buff or potions, (s)he  could be higher on this list. *(Side note: Pets and Followers is surprisingly strong in Multiplayer. As such, Druid is treated as A-Tier in Multiplayer)*

\-  14. Werewolf. So many mixed feelings. In Normal Mode he's a meat  grinder, cutting through tides of enemies in mere seconds. In Badass  Mode and Mutliplayer he's more fragile than a newborn and playing him  feels like a prolonged heart attack. He could so easily be A-Tier if his  Damage Reduction in Angery Mode was to 1 in Badass Mode. Werewolf is a  fun character, but his terrible stat distribution and reliance on his  Health being low to use his Skill effectively are keeping him way down.  (Side note: As mentioned previously, he is a genocidal maniac in Solo  Normal Mode, and can be treated as A-Tier when playing so.)

&amp;#x200B;

# Final Thoughts

With more gameplay come new updates, and as such this list is subject to change. Hope it helps you manage your team comp for multiplayer and maximise your badass wins!"
9b8erh,51,2018-08-29,Ich werde in vier Wochen sterilisiert (und habe viele Gedanken dazu),trodat5204,Weibsvolk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Weibsvolk/comments/9b8erh/ich_werde_in_vier_wochen_sterilisiert_und_habe/,"Ich bin wahnsinnig aufgeregt. Ich wollte mich schon seit Jahren sterilisieren lassen, eigentlich schon ""immer"", seit das Thema Verhütung eben für mich relevant ist. Mit Anfang Zwanzig habe ich bei einer Reihe von Gyn-Praxen angefragt und die Reaktionen haben, naja, mein Vertrauen in die Ärzteschaft nicht gerade gestärkt.

Mir wurde gesagt, eine Sterilisation unter 30 wäre illegal (was schlicht eine Lüge ist), dass ich mich garantiert umentscheiden werde, dass Kinder bekommen ganz natürlich ist und ich meine ""Probleme"" schon überwinden wurde, mir wurden Therapien nahegelegt und einmal tatsächlich ins Gesicht gelacht. Selten habe ich mich so wenig ernst genommen und so auf mein Schwanger-werden-können reduziert gefühlt. Schlimmer wurde das alles nur noch, weil ich durch die Recherche und den Austausch mit anderen vorher wusste, dass Männer mit selten mehr als nur einer Nachfrage  - ""Sicher? Wirklich?"" - problemlos im selben Alter sterilisiert werden. 

Ich habe dann zehn Jahre lang mit Kupferspiralen verhütet. Jetzt habe ich die magische 30 überschritten und das Thema gestern bei meiner Frauenärztin angesprochen. Die Hemmungen davor waren bei mir sehr hoch, aber sie hat letztendlich ganz neutral reagiert. Und nun steht der OP-Termin fest, ich kann es noch gar nicht glauben.

Der Grund, weshalb ich mich sterilisieren lassen möchte, ist natürlich der, dass ich keine Kinder bekommen möchte und keine Lust mehr auf Verhütungsmaßnahmen habe.
Aber ehrlich gesagt hat es auch etwas mit meinem Selbstempfinden zu tun. Kinder waren niemals Teil meiner Lebensvorstellungen, zu keinem Zeitpunkt meines Lebens. Später habe ich erkannt, dass es nicht nur ums Kinder haben geht - Schwanger-werden-können ist nicht Teil meiner Selbstbildes. Eine Zeit meines Lebens habe ich meine Periode gehasst, weil sie mich daran erinnert hat, dass mein Körper schwanger werden *will*, dass er jeden Monat gegen mich plant und plottet, sich intern umbaut und darauf vorbereitet, endlich eine befruchtete Eizelle zu empfangen. Ich fand das widerlich. Ich konnte schwangere Frauen nicht anschauen, stillende Mütter erst recht nicht. Ich fand alles, was mit Schwangerschaft/Kinder kriegen zu tun hat, unerträglich. Da das ja ganz offensichtlich nicht so ganz unter ""normal"" fällt, habe ich versucht, mich damit auseinanderzusetzen und herauszufinden, *warum* ich so reagiere. Ich bin damals zu keinem rechten Schluss gekommen, konnte aber einige der extremeren Gefühle ganz gut in den Griff bekommen. Irgendwann flachte das alles sehr ab und verlor an Wichtigkeit, und ich war dann, denke ich, auf dem ""normalen"" Maß von 'Kinder nicht mögen' und 'Schwangerschaft komisch finden' angekommen, so es denn eins gibt, worüber man sicher unterschiedlicher Meinung sein kann. 
Rückblickend meine ich erkannt zu haben, dass das eingetreten ist, als ich endlich meinem Verhütungsmittel vertraut habe. Ich hatte nicht mehr solche Angst, schwanger zu werden und damit hat sich die Fixierung auf das Thema verloren. Ich denke, als ich mir sicher war, dass nicht *ich* schwanger werden muss, konnte ich das bei anderen gelassener sehen und hinnehmen.

Nichtsdestotrotz möchte ich sterilisiert werden/sein. Selbst wenn ich keinen Partner hätte, selbst wenn ich den Rest meines Lebens abstinent leben würde, ich hätte lieber einen Körper, der nicht schwanger werden kann als einen, der es kann (und btw auch keinen, der Kinder zeugen kann).
 
Über all die Jahre habe ich mich immer wieder gefragt, was das für meine Weiblichkeit oder auch mein Frau-sein bedeutet. Nicht, dass ich keine Kinder haben möchte, sondern das ich keinen Körper haben möchte, der schwanger werden kann. Dass ich diesen ja doch sehr eklatant weiblichen Aspekt an mir völlig ablehne, gar nicht zu mir zugehöig empfinde. Der ""Rest"" meines Körpers stört mich nicht. Er ist eindeutig weiblich und das ist okay für mich. Ich fühle mich - nach einigem Hängen und Würgen - doch ziemlich 100%ig als Frau und weiblich, wobei ich natürlich nicht weiß, wie sich das anzufühlen hat, ich kann ja nur von mir und meinem Empfinden ausgehen und das hakt bei Umfragen ohne jedes Zögern oder Zähneknirschen ""weiblich"" an.

Obwohl ich, wenn ich es mir so richtig aussuchen könnte, wohl auch mit ""nichts"" als Geschlechtsangabe zufrieden wäre. Ich muss immer an eine Textzeile aus einem Lied denken, die ich so interpretiere, dass es sich auf die Frage nach dem Geschlecht bezieht: I want blank, I want frozen lake, I want deep space. 
Also wenn ich mein Geschlecht mit [     ] oder deep space angeben könnte, wäre ich auch zufrieden. ;D
Nein, aber insgesamt fühle ich mich als Frau und bin damit im Reinen. Auch wenn ich das Gefühl habe, mir die Zugehörigkeit zu meinen Geschlecht mit viel Kopfarbeit erarbeitet haben zu müssen und mit dieser OP und meiner schieren Freude darüber, endlich steril sein zu werden, den Rausschmiss zu riskieren.

Wie seht ihr das? Denkt ihr, Schwanger-werden-können oder -wollen gehört irgendwie zum Frau-sein mit dazu? Darf ich weiter bei den Frauen mitspielen, auch wenn ich DEN dediziert weiblichen Aspekt meines Körpers ausknipse und eh nie leiden mochte? 
Habt ihr ähnliche Erfahrungen mit Frauenärztinnen gemacht? Das würde mich auch interessieren. Und natürlich, ob irgendjemand sich vielleicht ähnlich fühlt."
9b9103,16,2018-08-29,"Unemployed, Miserable, Bit of a Story",brobiwankenobi89,Unemployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unemployed/comments/9b9103/unemployed_miserable_bit_of_a_story/,"Jesus Christ... Here we go.

I'm 29 years old, unemployed, and have been working odd jobs to survive since I graduated from university in Australia in 2013.  I'm an American citizen originally from Northern California and I currently live in Croatia with my mother-in-law as my wife is Croatian.  You want to know what flushing your dignity down the toilet is like?  Try living with your mother-in-law as an unemployed pos.  I can't work here because I'm not legally eligible without sponsorship but the country has no jobs anyways so it is what it is.  We have three kids.  Three.  Times were better when we decided to have kids but regardless, love 'em with all my heart.  I grew up playing rugby and was fairly decent at it; represented the junior international level in the US and became the 2nd American in 100 years to play the first side in the Queensland Premiership for my university.  I had a part-time job as a waiter and was actively volunteering; my degree is in International Relations (useless) and I figured it would benefit my job search.  I was in Student UN, etc... Seemed to think I had it made on Cloud 9.

​

Come 2012 I meet my wife volunteering in East Africa.  Love of my life and we hated each other at first...  She met my family in CA, then she came to Australia where she got pregnant right before my last semester in school.  I dealt with it, powered through the semester and graduated, then I came to this godforsaken sh\*\*hole country called Croatia because, I'm a man that is doing the right thing.  You don't bail.  You man up and do what you need to do to support the people who are going to be depending on you.  Don't get me wrong, the place is geographically beautiful, but having travelled the whole world I can say these are the worst people I have ever met.  Nationalist pricks with an unmatched arrogance--Balkaners.  I was way more optimistic after college, clueless, more inept than I care to remember, and didn't stand a chance at what I've faced up to now.  I took life in stride anyways, supported my wife and lost everything I had doing it: stocks, bonds, savings, dignity, you name it.

​

I've been relatively unemployed except for the odd jobs and volunteering gigs until about 2015. Come 2015 I decide I'll go to flight school.  I take out a monster loan and get my commercial pilots license.  I get a flying gig in Guam, wife doesn't like it, she heads back to Croatia and I follow her because...love...insert: stupidity.  We had two kids at that time and I could barely be away from them.  I eventually went back to Croatia, then to CA to try and find work during the recession, and in the stress of everything I got a DUI.  Lost my pilot medical certificate and cannot fly until I pay a barrel of money to go through the FAA HIMs program.  To be fair I wasn't driving.  My keys were in the car with the heat on and I was snoozing because I didn't want to drive.  CA cops what can you do.  So all that money and opportunity flushed down the toilet.  Even worse, I was slotted to fly helicopters for the Army and I had to flush that down the toilet too.

Later come 2018 I got a job as a floorhand on an oil rig in Texas and commuted back and forth from Croatia every two weeks.  The cost was insane just to commute to work, get food, gear, etc $1500+...  Eventually my age and old rugby injuries caught up with me, along with the jet lag, and the insane work, and I just couldn't keep up.  I decided I would stay in Croatia and try and get another oil rig job, preferably offshore or in the Middle East/Norway.  No dice.  This is where I find myself now, on the unemployed Reddit page.  True stupidity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.

I've submitted thousands of applications, tailored resumes and covers, used staffing agencies, checked Craigslist, offered to volunteer and intern, and I have received thousands of rejection letters.  Low paying jobs won't hire me because they think I'm overqualified and will run at the sign of a better job, a career job, and the good companies with entry-level jobs say I'm not experienced enough.  Not enough relevant experience.  I've tried networking but it rings true that 90% of people don't care, and the other 10% are happy you're in the situation you're in.  So I submitted a post on r/Jobopenings with my resume information, and I'm trudging forward in my pathetic attempt at an existence.

​

Really tough...  It's a mixture of bad luck and bad choices but this is the hand I have and I need to keep powering forward I guess.

9ba8gq,30,2018-08-29,Når du føler deg som en Komplett.no idiot,blinkoutblank,norge,https://www.reddit.com/r/norge/comments/9ba8gq/når_du_føler_deg_som_en_komplettno_idiot/,"Jeg kjøpte i slutten av juli en MacBook Pro 2018 15"", som nå ligger til 26990 kroner på Komplett, og oppdager iløpet av kort tid etter leveransen at denne lider av kernel panics. Tenk blåskjerm på Windows og du er nødt til å starte maskinen på nytt. Jeg reinstallerer og prøver alle triksene i boka, altså reset av SMC og nvRAM, du vet når du må holde flere knapper inne på en gang når maskinen starter for å få den til å ""fungere."" Ingenting gjorde verken ytelse, stabilitet eller den høye lyden fra viften noe bedre.

Så jeg kontakter Komplett.no og bruker chat etter å ha sendt inn en melding om DOA (dead on arrival) og de ber meg få et DOA nummer fra Apple. Jeg ringer inn til Apple, får et DOA nummer fra en senior rådgiver og avtaler å bytte ødelagt Mac mot ny Mac på pickup point i Oslo etter å ha gitt fra meg referansen jeg fikk fra Apple. Jeg avtaler å beholde maskinen i opptil 14 dager for å se om de får inn nye maskiner fra Apple, noe de gjør noen dager senere.

Jeg ringer opp igjen når jeg ser de har fått inn et nytt parti, og spør om de kan hedre avtalen min, men de sier at de ikke har noen DOA nummer/referanse fra Apple. Her må jeg si at deler av feilen ligger på min side, da jeg ikke tok screenshot av chatten, og det er umulig å få oversendt et transcript per mail etter avsluttet chat. Jeg møter en uvitende kar på telefonen, og han sier at jeg må sende inn Macen til de, så de får sett på den. Heldigvis har Apple en referanse fra datoen da jeg først tok kontakt med de, og de ringer til slutt opp til Komplett for å informere om at DOA er godkjent av de. På samme dag ble jeg lovet tilbakemelding av Komplett, men det kom ingenting henvendelse fra de verken på mail eller telefon slik de lovet.

Når jeg da kontakter de en tredje gang neste uke, så må jeg igjen få de til å finne referansen, opprette en intern sak i deres systemer, før jeg da får en bekreftelse på mail med saknummer og returnummer, men uten noen form for garanti eller lovnad om hva som kommer til å skje. Hver samtale med de har vart i rundt en time inkludert venting, og dette begynner å ta tid. Jeg anslår at med korrespondansen jeg har hatt med både Komplett og Apple, at jeg har brukt minst en hel arbeidsdag på åtte timer, og da regner jeg ikke med egen feilsøking for å unngå lange prosesser som oppstår ved retur.

Jeg syns det blir mer og mer beleilig å handle i vanlige butikker, der det er 30-50 dager returrett, og ingen av disse har bydd på særlig problem. De rydder som oftest opp med ny vare eller pengene tilbake. Igjen vil jeg si at det har vært enkelt å få igjen pengene fra Komplett, men hvis du har en retur som krever en ny vare, må du belage deg på venting.

Siste gang jeg prøvde å returnere en håndkontroll til en PS4 tok det meg rundt 2-3 måneder å få den tilbake fra Komplett, og jeg må ha brukt 10 forsøk på kontakt gjennom mail, chat og telefon for å få returen på plass. Selv om det har til tider vært et eventyr å handle på nett, syns jeg de store kjedene som Elkjøp og Power gjør en bedre jobb på kundeservice enn netthandel når det kommer til returer som krever reparasjon eller erstatning, så sant du bruker 30-50 dager returrett og de har ny vare på lager eller i bestilling.

I fjor brukte jeg mye mer penger hos Power enn Komplett, noe jeg også tror kan bli et tilfelle i år også. Å kunne se produktene, bytte de med fysiske mennesker og få oppgjøret gjort på stedet slår strevet det er å klage på Postnord, forholde seg til forskjellige avdelinger på mail og telefon, og så til slutt ende opp med å forklare alt på nytt igjen og igjen.

Sist gang jeg bestilte byggesett med PC deler fra Komplett, bestilte jeg levert hjem på døren av Postnord og satt lenge og ventet på de en tirsdagskveld. De hadde allerede signert pakken før klokken ni, kundeservice var stengt hos både Postnord og Komplett, og ifølge appen til Postnord var pakken utlevert og signert for. Jeg tok med meg lommelykten for å se om den var lagt ut på en annen manns dørstokk, men fant ingenting, og en god time senere fikk jeg en telefon fra en mann som lurte på om jeg var hjemme. Han tok fram en tom lapp som jeg måtte signere på, og ikke noe annet.

Komplett og Postnord svarte på klagen min dagen etter, men det var ingen unnskyldning. De var heller jævla irriterte på at jeg gadd å klage. Det er kjipt når du har bestilt deg 1080 GTX Ti, 8700 og resten av hardwaren som gjør den komplett, det er 30 minus ute.

Nettet har heller ikke lenger noen fordeler på pris lenger heller, da jeg ofte ser at ting kan være dyrere på nettet enn i butikk, fordi det er mulig, siden alle tror nettet er så billig siden det er ""rett fra lageret."" Problemet er at alle butikker har et lager, alle har ansatte som ikke bryr seg og hvis de sitter bak en telefon eller en mail, så gir de enda mer faen. Nå sitter jeg og venter, håper at en de fem kundekonsulentene skal gi meg en løsning utenom å sitere interne nummererte referanser som kun kan forstås av de som har jobbet på Komplett.

Husk å noter navnet på alle du snakker med på telefon og chat. Ta screenshot av avtaler i chatten, og be om å få tilsendt referat av telefonsamtaler på mail som bekreftet innholdet før du avslutter samtalen. Hvis du ikke kommer noen vei, ta kontakt med forbrukerrådet og la de gjennomgå innsamlede opplysninger for riktig rådgivning.

9baclv,1,2018-08-29,about work,ninanamaste,ibs,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/9baclv/about_work/,"So I am currently a 21yo university student but I had quite a few student summer jobs and internships. During that time my IBS always gets worse so I started observing myself and the IBS and noticed that even if I like my coworkers and my job the fact that I can't eat whenever I feel like or go to the toilet whenever I have to stress me out and gives me anxiety. Somehow I always feel trapped in my work environment not able to be who I am and meet my bodies needs accordingly. Usually that causes me to undereat on weekdays (to avoid diarreah and unwanted pain) and then binge eat during the weekends which leaves me feeling sick and exhausted.

 he good thing is I am still at university not required to work full time but eventually I have to graduate and get a full time job and that is freaking me out.

 Do any of you have similar experiences or tricks how you cope with this?"

van Financiën over de belastingtelefoon en alternatieve manieren van  
communiceren met de Belastingdienst. &amp;#40;ingezonden 17 juli 2018&amp;#41;  
1      
Herinnert u zich dat uw ambtsvoorgangers in bijvoorbeeld de 16e &amp;#40;pagina

werkdagen  
- terugbelafspraken volgens afspraken met burgers en bedrijven?  
- kwaliteit beantwoording fiscale vragen belastingtelefoon  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 1:  
Ja  
&amp;nbsp;    
2     
Waarom zijn deze gegevens niet meer opgenomen in de 20e en 21e  
halfjaarsrapportage, terwijl ze toch buitengewoon relevant bleken te zijn?  
4     
Zijn er meer relevante tabellen en cijfers uit de halfjaarsrapportages  
gelaten, die toch essentieel zijn om een inzicht te geven in de problemen  
en uitdagingen van de Belastingdienst? Zo ja, welke zijn dat dan?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vragen 2 en 4:  
De set productietabellen in de 20e en de 21e Halfjaarsrapportage &amp;#40;HJR&amp;#41;  
bevat de indicatoren uit de begroting IX 2017. De meeste door u genoemde  
gegevens waren in het verleden &amp;#40;deels tot 2011, deels tot 2016&amp;#41; in de  
begroting opgenomen indicatoren over de dienstverlening van de  
Belastingdienst. Vanaf de begroting van 2017 zijn andere, in onze ogen meer  
relevante indicatoren opgenomen. De bereikbaarheidsindicator biedt  
bijvoorbeeld enkel inzicht in de bereikbaarheid van de telefonische  
dienstverlening, terwijl de Belastingdienst via meerdere kanalen diensten  
verleent. Er zijn andere indicatoren die inzicht geven in deze prestaties:  
in de begroting 2017 is daarom de KPI ‘klanttevredenheid’ voor de  
dienstverleningskanalen telefoon, website, en balie opgenomen, die  
gebaseerd is op de principes van het Canadese ICCS-Client Satisfaction  
Model &amp;#40;zie ook het antwoord bij vraag 3&amp;#41;.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ook voor de andere “productietabellen” uit de HJR geldt dat vanaf de 20e  
HJR wordt aangesloten bij de begrotingsindicatoren. Daarmee wordt bereikt  
dat een duidelijke set indicatoren wordt gepresenteerd die een actueel  
beeld geeft van de uitvoering in relatie tot de in de lopende begroting  
geformuleerde doelstellingen en streefwaarden.  
&amp;nbsp;    
3     
Kunt u deze gegeven per half jaar over de afgelopen vijf jaren in een tabel  
zetten &amp;#40;per half jaar&amp;#41;, inclusief de streefcijfers?  
Antwoord op vraag 3:  
Hieronder wordt een overzicht van de gevraagde gegevens weergegeven.  
[pic]  
De bereikbaarheid &amp;#40;%&amp;#41; is het aantal geholpen bellers via ofwel een  
belastingtelefoonmedewerker ofwel via de zogenaamde bestelautomaat voor  
formulieren, afgezet tegen het aantal binnengekomen telefoontjes. De  
binnengekomen telefoontjes zijn inclusief bellers die, bijvoorbeeld vanwege  
grote drukte, geen toegang krijgen tot het keuzemenu van de  
Belastingtelefoon.  
De technische bereikbaarheid &amp;#40;%&amp;#41; betrekt in de bereikbaarheid zowel de  
bellers die via het keuzemenu zijn geholpen met het aanvragen van uitstel  
of die anderszins via het keuzemenu voldoende zijn geïnformeerd, als de  
bellers die zelf het gesprek beëindigen in het keuzemenu &amp;#40;bv. omdat de  
beller geen BSN bij de hand heeft&amp;#41;. De technische bereikbaarheid wordt  
sinds 2015 gemeten. De technische bereikbaarheid is destijds  
geïntroduceerd, omdat de Belastingtelefoon bellers door uitbreiding van de  
technische mogelijkheden via en in het keuzemenu steeds meer kon helpen  
zonder dat er een gesprek met een belastingtelefoonmedewerker nodig of  
mogelijk &amp;#40;door het zelf beëindigen van de verbinding door de beller in het  
menu&amp;#41; was. Voorbeelden van deze vorm van hulp zijn het aanvragen van  
uitstel, het vermelden van algemene informatie via een eindtekst &amp;#40;bv. datum  
uitbetaling&amp;#41; of het bestellen van een formulier. De &amp;#40;oorspronkelijke&amp;#41;  
indicator bereikbaarheid werd daardoor steeds minder representatief als  
maatstaf voor geholpen bellers.  
De methodiek voor de bepaling van de kwaliteit van beantwoording van de wet-  
 en regelgevingsvragen is in 2016 gewijzigd. Sinds die tijd wordt gewerkt  
met een klanttevredenheidssystematiek, waarvan de gepercipieerde kwaliteit  
van de beantwoording van fiscale vragen onderdeel uitmaakt. Dit Centraal  
Klant Tevredenheid Onderzoek &amp;#40;hierna: CKTO&amp;#41; is ingericht volgens de  
principes van het Canadese ICCS-Client Satisfaction Model. De KPI voor  
Klanttevredenheid die in de Rijksbegroting sinds 2017 is opgenomen is op  
deze methodiek gebaseerd. Hiervoor worden bellers- website- en  
baliebezoekers gevraagd om op een vijfpuntsschaal hun tevredenheid aan te  
geven. De tabel hieronder geeft de samengestelde cijfers over 2017 weer van  
de klanttevredenheid over telefonie, website en balie. Daarnaast wordt de  
klanttevredenheid over het telefoniekanaal separaat weergegeven.  
 [pic]  
De cijfers van de eerste helft van 2018 over bereikbaarheid laten een  
wisselend beeld zien. Voor een toelichting op deze cijfers verwijs ik u  
naar de antwoorden op de Kamervragen van 9 juli jl.[1]  
&amp;nbsp;    
5    
Kunt u over de afgelopen zes maanden per maand de volgende cijfers geven  
voor de belastingtelefoon:  
- ziekteverzuim percentage  
- wachtrij instellingen &amp;#40;inclusief een uitleg&amp;#41;  
- aantal mensen dat bij de belastingtelefoon werkt &amp;#40;in fte&amp;#41;  
- aantal uitzendkrachten dat bij de belastingtelefoon werkt &amp;#40;in fte&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 5:  
- ziekteverzuim percentage  
In onderstaande tabellen is het ziekteverzuim weergegeven voor 2018 van  
alle medewerkers die voor de Belastingtelefoon werken, uitgesplitst naar  
ambtelijk personeel en uitzendkrachten.  
[pic]  
In het bovenstaande overzicht zijn voor het ambtelijk personeel zowel het  
ziekteverzuim per maand als het voortschrijdend 12-maandsgemiddelde  
weergegeven voor 2018.  
[pic]  
De administratie van het ziekteverzuim van uitzendkrachten is een  
verantwoordelijkheid van de uitzendpartner. Deze registreert het  
ziekteverzuim per vier weken. Dit is in de tabel weergegeven. De  
Belastingtelefoon heeft geen beschikking over maandcijfers noch het  
voortschrijdend 12-maandsgemiddelde.  
&amp;nbsp;    
- wachtrij instellingen &amp;#40;inclusief een uitleg&amp;#41;  
De Belastingtelefoon past wachtrijmanagement toe om bellers op een zo goed  
mogelijke manier te bedienen op die momenten dat er veel bellers zijn en de  
bereikbaarheid beperkt is. Daarbij is de insteek dat bellers alleen tot een  
wachtrij worden toegelaten als de verwachte wachttijd van een acceptabele  
lengte is. Veel bellers hangen ook zelf op als zij de wachtrij te lang  
vinden. Bellers die ophangen worden niet meegenomen in de bereikbaarheid,  
maar wel in de technische bereikbaarheid.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bij het toelaten tot de wachtrij wordt een beller geïnformeerd over de  
verwachte wachttijd. Wanneer een beller niet wordt toegelaten tot de  
wachtrij, is na het doorlopen van het menu de volgende  meldtekst te horen:  
""Het is op dit moment erg druk. Al onze medewerkers zijn in gesprek en de  
wachtrij is helaas vol. Probeert u het later nog eens. Informatie kunt u  
ook vinden op www.belastingdienst.nl. Wij verbreken nu de verbinding.""  
Om de wachtrijen te managen, gebruikt de Belastingtelefoon twee soorten  
instellingen op basis waarvan bellers al dan niet worden toegelaten tot een  
wachtrij. De Belastingtelefoon kan de lengte van de wachtrij variëren  
afhankelijk van het  aantal beschikbare medewerkers &amp;#40;topic overload  
protection, TOP&amp;#41;  en daarnaast kan worden gevarieerd afhankelijk van de  
verwachte wachttijd &amp;#40;estimated waiting time, EWT&amp;#41;.  
&amp;nbsp;    
De TOP betreft de verhouding tussen het aantal actieve  
belastingtelefoonmedewerkers in de lijn &amp;#40;met de kennis om deze vraag te  
beantwoorden&amp;#41; en het aantal toe te laten bellers in de wachtrij. Een hogere  
waarde houdt in dat de wachtrijen en daarmee wachttijden hoger kunnen  
oplopen en bellers minder snel worden geweigerd. Een hoge TOP-instelling  
wordt gekozen om bellers de keuze te geven te wachten of later terug te  
bellen. Een concreet voorbeeld hiervan: bij een T.O.P.-instelling van 0,5  
is het maximaal aantal bellers dat in een wachtrij wordt geplaatst gelijk  
aan de helft van het aantal actieve informanten in de lijn. Staan er 50  
bellers in de wachtrij op een topic waar 100 informanten voor actief zijn,  
dan is de wachtrij op dat moment vol &amp;#40;er zijn dan 150 bellers op het  
betreffende topic in het proces&amp;#41; en zullen nieuwe calls middels het  
mechanisme van de T.O.P. worden geweigerd.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Daarnaast gebruikt de Belastingtelefoon de EWT-hangup instelling. Hiermee  
worden bellers al dan niet toegelaten tot een wachtrij op basis van de  
verwachte gemiddelde wachttijd. Concreet voorbeeld hiervan: Een EWT-Hangup  
die actief wordt bij een drempelwaarde van 7 minuten, zorgt ervoor dat  
indien de gemiddelde wachttijd op een topic over de voorgaande 10 minuten  
boven de 7 minuten ligt, een nieuwe beller niet meer tot de wachtrij wordt  
toegelaten. Dit kan worden ingezet als verfijning van de TOP-instelling.  
Met een EWT-hangup instelling wordt de lengte van een wachtrij beperkt  
wanneer de gemiddelde wachttijd over de voorgaande tien minuten de  
ingestelde waarde overschrijdt.  
Voor de contactthema’s binnen de drie grote werkstromen ondernemingen,  
particulieren en toeslagen zijn de volgende instellingen actief geweest dit  
jaar:  
[pic]NB: de genoemde data in bovenstaande tabel zijn data waarop een T.O.P.-  
instelling en/of EWT-Hangup-instelling zijn gewijzigd. De genoemde  
instellingen in de tabel zijn dus steeds vanaf die datum actief geweest.  
Bij kleinere werkstromen zoals auto en douane is over het algemeen de  
T.O.P.-instelling 1.0 en de EWT Hangup-instelling niet actief, omdat de  
wachttijden bij deze werkstromen geen aanleiding geven tot het toepassen  
van wachtrijmanagement.  
&amp;nbsp;    
In april was de wachttijd weer op niveau waardoor in mei weer meer de keuze  
bij de beller werd gelaten door de TOP hoger in te zetten. Bij de  
werkstroom Ondernemingen leiden dit echter tot hoger wachttijden  en is de  
EWT ingezet.  
De burger merkt bij beide instellingen de effecten. Bij TOP het al dan niet  
toelaten tot de wachtrij en bij EWT het al dan niet maximeren. Overigens  
wordt de beller bij het toelaten tot de wachtrij geïnformeerd over de  
wachttijd.  
&amp;nbsp;    
- aantal mensen dat bij de belastingtelefoon werkt &amp;#40;in fte&amp;#41; en het aantal  
uitzendkrachten dat bij de belastingtelefoon werkt &amp;#40;in fte&amp;#41;  
In onderstaande tabel is het aantal fte weergegeven van alle medewerkers  
die voor de Belastingtelefoon werken. [pic]  
&amp;nbsp;    
6      
Kunt u uitgebreid toelichten waarom het onmogelijk is om een telefoonnummer  
achter te laten, zodat mensen die lang in de wachtrij hebben gestaan en  
niemand te pakken hebben gekregen, maar zelf goed bereikbaar zijn, op een  
voor de Belastingdienst rustiger moment teruggebeld kunnen worden?  
Antwoord op vraag 6:   
Het is met het huidige telefonieplatform wel mogelijk om een  
terugbelmogelijkheid in te richten, maar hiervoor is niet gekozen. Een  
dergelijke terugbelfaciliteit kan namelijk alleen efficiënt gebruikt worden  
bij tijdelijke pieken, omdat er dan in de dalen teruggebeld kan worden.  
Tijdens langdurige pieken zoals de IH-campagne &amp;#40;wanneer zich geen dalen  
voordoen&amp;#41; is dit niet het geval. Mijn streven is om de bereikbaarheid begin  
2019 weer op het niveau van de eerste helft van 2017 te brengen.  
7  
Acht u het van goed werkgeverschap getuigen dat u constant nieuwe  
uitzendkrachten aanneemt bij de belastingtelefoon en er niet voor zorgt dat  
goede uitzendkrachten een vast contract krijgen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 7:  
Het telefonieaanbod bij de Belastingtelefoon is onderhevig aan pieken en  
dalen. Gedurende bijvoorbeeld de aangifteperiode van de IH wordt meer  
gebeld dan gedurende andere momenten in het jaar. De piekwerkzaamheden  
worden door uitzendkrachten opgevangen. In de periode 2013-2015 werkte de  
Belastingtelefoon met ongeveer 70% uitzendkrachten. De Wet werk en  
zekerheid &amp;#40;hierna: WWZ&amp;#41; en de circulaire over de toepassing ervan binnen de  
Rijksoverheid heeft er toe geleid dat het aandeel uitzendkrachten bij de  
belastingtelefoon inmiddels is gedaald tot ca. 50%. Hiermee heeft de  
Belastingtelefoon een verschuiving in de verhoudingen ten gunste van het  
aantal vaste medewerkers gerealiseerd. In de komende maanden zal dit nog  
verder dalen, waarbij de doelstelling is om op 1 januari 2019 op een  
verhouding ambtelijk personeel en uitzendkrachten uit te komen van 68% en  
32%.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Als gevolg van de Wet allocatie arbeidskrachten door intermediairs hebben  
uitzendkrachten een goede positie bij de werving van vaste krachten,  
waarvan ook veel gebruik wordt gemaakt. Uit eerdere wervingen blijkt dat  
vaste vacatures zeer vaak door eerder bij de Belastingtelefoon werkzame  
uitzendkrachten ingevuld worden. Naast vervulling van deze vacatures zal  
als gevolg van de verdere toepassing van de circulaire toepassing WWZ de  
komende maanden nog uitzendkrachtcapaciteit worden omgezet naar ambtelijke  
formatie, zodat de verhouding ambtelijk personeel en uitzendkrachten per 1  
januari 2019 uitkomt op de genoemde verhouding van 68% versus 32%.  
&amp;nbsp;    
8    
Acht u het verstandig om in deze krappe arbeidsmarkt te blijven werken met  
tijdelijke uitzendkrachten bij de belastingtelefoon?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 8:  
Piekwerkzaamheden zijn makkelijker op te vangen met flexkrachten. De WWZ  
en de circulaire toepassing WWZ bij de overheid bieden de mogelijkheid om  
werk met het karakter van piekwerkzaamheden te laten vervullen door  
flexkrachten  
De Belastingtelefoon hanteert een systematiek waarmee het percentage aan  
piekwerkzaamheden jaarlijks wordt vastgesteld. Elk jaar wordt opnieuw op  
basis van dit percentage bepaald in welke verhouding vast personeel en  
flexwerkers wordt ingezet, zodat voldaan wordt aan de genoemde circulaire.  
Deze verhouding is, zoals ook bij antwoord op vraag 7 weergegeven,  
vastgesteld op 68% - 32% in 2019. Dit betekent dat het aandeel vast  
personeel ten opzichte van uitzendkrachten het komende jaar gaat stijgen.  
Het is overigens operationeel goed mogelijk om met een hoger percentage  
vaste of tijdelijk ambtelijke krachten te werken. Omdat ambtelijke krachten  
minder makkelijk uit te roosteren zijn, is er bij dalingen in het  
telefonieaanbod meer overcapaciteit. Overigens wordt een wijziging in de  
verhouding ambtelijk personeel - uitzendkrachten de komende jaren begrensd  
door gemaakte werkafspraken met een uitzendpartner. Hiermee is een  
meerjarig contract afgesloten, waarin werkafspraken zijn gemaakt over een  
benodigde bandbreedte aan in te zetten fte’s uitzendkrachten &amp;#40;250-600 fte  
in 2019 en 200-500 fte in 2020&amp;#41;.  
9     
Herinnert u zich nog dat uw ambtsvoorgangers in 2013 en 2016 bevestigd  
hebben dat de Belastingdienst eraan werkt dat de burger ook elektronisch  
kan communiceren met de belastingdienst? 1&amp;#41;?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 9:  
Ja.  
&amp;nbsp;    
10   
Wanneer kan de burger elektronische berichten naar de Belastingdienst  
sturen en een rechtsgeldig antwoord krijgen, zoals meerdere malen  
toegezegd?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 10:  
Het beleid van de Belastingdienst over het gebruik van elektronisch  
berichtenverkeer is neergelegd in het Besluit Fiscaal Bestuursrecht. E-  
mailcommunicatie tussen de Belastingdienst en belastingplichtigen is niet  
opengesteld voor formele berichten. Dit geldt voor alle onderdelen van de  
Belastingdienst. De reden hiervoor is dat belastingplichtigen niet altijd  
gebruik maken van een beveiligde internetverbinding, waardoor persoonlijke  
gegevens openbaar kunnen worden. Het is dan ook niet mogelijk om formele  
berichten, zoals een belastingaangifte, een aanvraag voor toeslagen of een  
bezwaarschrift per e-mail bij de Belastingdienst in te dienen. Omgekeerd is  
het de Belastingdienst ook niet toegestaan om enkel per e-mail een aanslag  
of beslissingen op bezwaar aan een belastingplichtige te sturen. Dergelijke  
stukken worden aan particulieren in ieder geval ook per post verzonden en  
kunnen daarnaast als service via de online Berichtenbox worden verzonden.  
Wel stelt de Belastingdienst e-mailverkeer open voor individuele  
zaakgebonden gegevensuitwisseling in de processen van toezicht &amp;#40;inclusief  
kantoortoetsing&amp;#41;, inning en dienstverlening en voor de ondersteuning van  
facilitaire processen. Het e-mailen is beperkt tot één nauw omschreven zaak  
en het verstrekken van een e-mailadres is met waarborgen omkleed.  
&amp;nbsp;    
In de interactiestrategie die ik in juni 2018 naar de Tweede Kamer heb  
gestuurd is aangegeven dat het streven van de Belastingdienst is om  
digitale interactie op termijn mogelijk te maken. Het betreft een van de  
ontwikkelopgaven uit de interactiestrategie. Een belangrijke randvoorwaarde  
is dat dit veilig kan plaatsvinden. Dat is nu nog niet het geval.  
&amp;nbsp;    
11   
Indien een burger een brief wil sturen naar de Belastingdienst met een  
vraag, waar moet hij die dan naartoe sturen en hoe kan de burger een  
ontvangstbevestiging krijgen van die brief?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 11:  
Op de website www.belastingdienst.nl staat een overzicht van de  
postadressen van de Belastingdienst. Voor een aantal thema’s is een  
specifiek postadres opgenomen. Overige vragen kunnen worden verzonden naar  
het dichtstbijzijnde belastingkantoor. Mocht een burger per abuis een brief  
naar het verkeerde adres sturen, dan wordt de brief intern doorgestuurd.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bij bezwaar wordt altijd een ontvangstbevestiging gestuurd. Overige vragen  
worden zo spoedig mogelijk beantwoord. Als beantwoording langer gaat duren  
wordt ofwel een behandelingsbevestiging gestuurd of wordt telefonisch  
contact opgenomen met de vrager. Als de vrager zeker wil zijn van een  
ontvangstbevestiging kan hij zijn schriftelijke vraag bij de balie van een  
belastingkantoor indienen en vragen om een ontvangstbevestiging.  
&amp;nbsp;    
12   
Binnen hoeveel dagen krijgt een burger antwoord op een brief?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 12:  
De procedure hangt af van de inhoud van de brief en of het bijvoorbeeld een  
bezwaar, klacht, WOB verzoek of een overige vraag betreft. De  
Belastingdienst probeert vragen zo spoedig mogelijk te beantwoorden. Als de  
beantwoording van de vraag langer gaat duren wordt contact opgenomen met de  
vrager. De Belastingdienst volgt voor zover van toepassing de termijnen  
zoals die in de Awb/Awr genoemd staan.  
&amp;nbsp;    
13   
Tot welk belastingkantoor kan een burger &amp;#40;of een MKB-bedrijf&amp;#41; zich wenden,  
indien deze een zogeheten ruling wil hebben en dus rechtszekerheid - die  
hij bij de belastingtelefoon niet krijgt - en hoe verloopt dan de  
procedure?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 13:  
Zowel nationaal en internationaal opererende bedrijven, individuen en  
kleine ondernemers hebben de mogelijkheid vooraf zekerheid te krijgen over  
de toepassing van wet- en regelgeving op het gebied van belastingen. De  
belastingplichtige kan een schriftelijk verzoek opstellen en sturen naar  
het betreffende belastingkantoor of belastinginspecteur. De inspecteur zal  
dit verzoek vervolgens beoordelen. Uitgebreide informatie over het  
aanvragen van een ruling en het verloop van de procedure is te vinden op de  
website van de Belastingdienst.[2]  
&amp;nbsp;    
14   
Kunt u deze vragen een voor een en binnen drie weken beantwoorden?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 14:  
De vragen zijn zo snel mogelijk beantwoord. Het is vanwege de recesperiode  
niet gelukt dit binnen de periode van drie weken te doen.

&gt;Thanks for writing. As the author of many books written about I Love Lucy, I can assure you that Ricky Ricardo never uttered those words in that way.  In the I Love Lucy book, there is actually a note on this ""urban legend.""  He did, however, say the following:

- “Splain that if you can (8)
- Lucy, if you’ll just give me a chance to ‘splain (11)
- Lucy, ‘splain (81)
- Okay, start ‘splainin’ (168)


Maybe that will help to 'splain why you think you heard that quote from his mouth.

**Article snippet**

LOS ANGELES (AP) - Hundreds of Lucy and Desi wanna-bes, hoping to play the comedy duo in a television movie, flooded CBS Television City with red hair and broken English as a nationwide casting search began.    .    .

&gt;Yes, that was from the auditions for that horrible CBS movie that prompted Lucie and Desi to make the documentary on their parents (Lucy &amp; Desi: A Home Movie).  It is one of those weird urban legends that has very long legs.  We even argued with CBS about it (they insisted he had said it) so they put an intern on it for a week (watching each and every episode) and finally had to agree with us.  Our licensees often try to get us to allow them to use that phrase on a t-shirt or mug but we always say no because it would only increase the lie!  Thanks!

There you go, make of it what you will.  I'm just putting it out there.

He is at his duty station I stayed in NJ with my family to complete my grad program. I am in my last year of my program which requires an unpaid internship. He just confirmed with me that he is being deployed in October.  Due to poor planning on my part I am not really in a place financially to travel. I left my part job back in May to focus on Graduate School. I found out they won't pay for school this semester because I am less then 6 credits. I am not able to pay my term bill to start class next week. But I've been looking into finding funding.

Long story short I am considering taking the semester off to support my husband before his deployment. I am trying to decided whether I should take the semester off to support hubby or try to find funding for school through the military. He seems a little depressed. I am worried. He recently deactivated his facebook. I am planning on getting a job. Do you have any advice or suggestions? Would you stay in school or be with your spouse to support them before deployment? I am literally torn but stuck at the same time.

Sorry for my long message. Just trying to find help where I can.

I am still on the hunt to do a literate fandom romance rp. Below are a few plot ideas, but I'm open to any you may have! (Note: These are Canon x OC, with you playing the canon role)

New Royal Crush (M x F or M x M)

Bowser x OC Bowser grew tired of chasing Princess Peach. He knew she didn't feel the same way he did. So he decided to pursue a new person...

This can be kidnapping, or maybe Bowser shows a sweet side. Up to you!

Not for Long (M x M)

Wallace Wells x OC (Scott Pilgrim Rp) When Scott brings over his new friend from work, Wallace outs on his usual moves. His best friend telling him the cute boy is straight won't stop him...

The Lab Intern (M x F or M x M) Professor Birch x OC (Pokemon) When Professor Birch was told he would get a new intern, he wasn't expecting someone so cute. As his feelings grow by the day, what will he do?

SHE/HE'S MINE! (M x F or M x M) BTR guys x OC (Big Time Rush) After a new up and coming artist moves into the Palm Woods, the guys go crazy for them (except for Kendall). Who will this new artist choose?

This is a love rivalry plot.

New to the Force (M x M) The Ginyu Force x OC (Dragon Ball Z) After Guildo left, the Ginyu force hired a new member- but weren't expecting someone so adorable and begin fighting over him. What will he do?

This is a love rivalry plot.

Game on, dude! (M x F or M x M) Bastion, Chumley and Hassleberry x OC (Yugioh GX) After a new student moved to Duel Academy, the guys couldn't resist them. Who will the newbie go for?

I will play pretty much all other characters in this, and it's a love rivalry.

Colors (M x M) Beast Boy x OC (Teen Titans) Beast Boy never thought he would love again. Until a cute boy joined their team... Wait, did he like guys? How will he deal with his feelings as they grow stronger?

Moving on (M x F or M x M) Tom x OC (Star vs the forces of evil After getting dumped by Star for Marco, Tom never thought he'd love again... Until someone new comes into his sights...

If none of these strike your fancy, feel free to give me your ideas/fandoms! Other fandoms I enjoy but don't have a specific plot for: Adventure Time, Avatar the last airbender, Disney, Inuyasha, Left 4 Dead, Legend of Korra, Total Drama

⭐⭐ Here are my rules:

1. Please be literate. No text talk or bad grammar (minus the occasional slip up of course).

2. I only rp in 3rd person. This is non-negotiable. Please be okay doing 3rd.

3. I ONLY PLAY UKE/SUB, NEVER DOM!!!! MY CHARACTERS ARE SUBS ONLY!!!! You have been warned!!!!

4. Be okay with OC x canon

5. Please be an active role player overall. We all have lives but please don't just disappear for days on end and never return.

6. If you are looking for all smut, you have come to the wrong place. I am fine with a build up to smut, but I want there to be a focus on romance and plot.

7. Please be respectful of me. I am a very friendly person but the quickest way to end an rp with me is to treat me badly. I am a human that deserves dignity like everyone else. Insult me once and it's over.

8. I'm sorry, but if your profile pic has a real person in it, I would ask that you change it before rping. It really just throws me off as weird as that sounds (anime/cartoon pics, scenery and anything else really are fine).

9. I usually do written bios, but if you HAVE to have pictures, I only do anime/cartoon refs and will only accept the same. NO REAL LIFE PICS PLEASE!!!

I am fine with people of all gender expressions, as long as you play M! My timezone is EST US time. All characters will be 18+. I am working most of today but I will reply as soon as possible.

I think that's it? If interested, kik:

Hope to rp soon!

9bboha,1,2018-08-29,[M4A] From Trainee Personal Assistant to the Trophy Wife of a Billionaire [Feminisation] [Romance] [Daddy-kink] [Long-term],clip-clop,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/9bboha/m4a_from_trainee_personal_assistant_to_the_trophy/,"A Fortune 500 Company. Multiple covers on Times magazine. A spate of chat show appearances. You're one of the most successful and well recognised businessmen in the country. And all that before you've turned 40. 

Yet you never forgot your roots. Coming from a poor single-parent family, you know it took a lot of graft, and even more luck, to get to where you are today. And you don't want to be one of those businessmen who pull up the ladder behind you. Instead, you've decided to run an outreach programme, allowing one lucky young man from a similar background to you to experience a few months alongside you. You'll allow them to experience the world of big business, giving them an internship in one of your companies, as well as personally giving them lessons on the dos and don'ts of the professional world. And as an added bonus, you'll let them live in your multi-million dollar mansion!

But regardless of whether you want to admit it or not, there's a deeper reasoning behind your decision. Years of toil on your businesses has resulted in you neglecting your social life. You haven't had a stable relationship with a woman in years, let alone brought any children into the world. And sitting at night in your empty mansion, you feel overwhelmingly alone. You could get almost any woman in the world, of course, but most of them are just after your money, not after you. What you want is protégé, a companion, someone who cares about *who* you are, not *what* you have. And that's the real reason behind this programme. 

I'm your average 18 year old guy. I play video games, I go out with my friends, I refuse to clean my room. When I left High School, I thought the world would open up for me. But after rejection after rejection, I could see my future closing up. When I applied to your programme, it was one last throw of the dice, one futile hope at a future beyond blue-collar boredom. And to my surprise, my amazement, I actually got in!

However, when you finally meet me, seeing my surprisingly big eyes, lithe body and firm ass, you start getting different ideas, taboo ideas, ideas which you desperately try to suppress but fail to. In this young man you don't see a man, you see a woman, you see a daughter, you see a lover. And using your influence, you're going to try you best to bring this woman out into the open. 

---

Hi there! As the prompt suggests, I'm looking for a feminisation prompt based around a CEO turning me into their slutty new daughter. I will play a young man (18+) who has won the opportunity to be your intern for the summer. You will play a CEO, either male or female (but preferably the latter), who takes me on as an intern, but increasingly views me as a substitute slutty daughter. 

I would like this prompt to focus on our thoughts, feeling and emotions. For me, I want to be torn between my male identity, and the desire to be a wanted, loved and desired daughter. For you, you will struggle between wanting to give this young man a constructive and educative summer, and wanting to cave into your more carnal desires by turning him into your new slutty daughter. Of course the sex will come, but I'd also like there to be lots of character development and sexual tension. 

My main kinks are romance, feminisation, incest, cumplay/bukkake/gokkun, D/s (with me as the s) outfits and lingerie, build-up, free use, taking orders, name calling and group sex. My limits are u18s, excessive pain, non-con and skat/watersports. 

I try to respond at least once per day, although sometimes real life will get in the way. I write in the first person present, and generally try to write detail, liking around 3 paragraphs per response (although of course that fluctuates). In your response, I'd like you to include a little bit about your character, your kinks, and how you imagine this RP developing. I usually leave prompts up a little while before replying, so don't feel the need to rush your response. I'll try and reply to everyone, but one line messages probably won't get a response."

PLEASE READ TO THE END! I have no limits except for poor spelling/grammar, and short replies. The fewer limits you have, the better! I want things to get really fucked up ;) 

——————————————————-

**BANG BANG BANG BANG**

My father lied in his bed, exhausted but unable to sleep over the loud sounds coming from his door. All he could do was watch the door shake violently in rhythm, looking ready to break right off its hinges at any moment. 

Just on the other side of his door were two  people my father knew quite well. There was me, his teenage daughter, my face and overdeveloped chest being slammed against the door again and again. And there was Darius, the absolute bane of my poor father’s existence. 

Ever since they met in middle school, Darius had gone out of his way to make every day of my dad’s life a living nightmare. His family is incredibly wealthy and powerful, so he’s never once had to experience any sort of repercussions for his actions. Darius would beat him so badly he had to be hospitalized regularly. And that was nothing compared to the psychological and emotional torture he put him through. There was the time my father actually managed to get a girlfriend...until Darius tied him to a chair and fucked her with his enormous horse cock right in front of him. Or when my grandmother - a gorgeous, sexy MILF at the time - finally tried to stand up for my father, and Darius wound up fucking her, taking a picture with his cock resting next to her cum covered face, on top of what was clearly your pillow from your bed, then printed out copies and put them up all over school. The locker rooms were torture of course, especially since my father has a medically diagnosed condition called “baby penis syndrome”, meaning his penis never grew since birth. Hence his nickname, “Baby Dick”, that stuck with him all throughout school. Darius even had the teachers calling him that when he used his father’s power to change his name in the school’s system. 

My father somehow survived these years of torture, and moved as far away as he could to go to college. Miraculously, he actually managed to get a girl to let him have sex with her, and although she laughed when he dropped his pants and he came the moment his dick touched her pussy, she got pregnant with me. She wanted nothing to do with me, and he was given full custody. He managed to get a decent paying job in a generic corporate office as an accountant, and while we didn’t have much, we were still getting by and very close. 

That was until Darius turned up in his life yet again. 

He waltzed into my father’s office building one day, and somehow - just like in high school - Darius always got just what he wanted, and by that afternoon, somehow Darius had become my father’s boss. He was immediately given a pay cut, in fact being declared an unpaid intern. His workload however, increased 10 fold. From scrubbing toilets to doing paperwork for everyone in the office, he was running around all day for pennies. 

But at least he still had me, his little honeybee. That’s what he kept telling himself as his nightmare returned with you entering his life again. That made it all the worse when he came home after cleaning the office after hours again one night to find Darius in the kitchen, me lying naked on my back on the table, trying to moan but unable as Darius’ huge hands are wrapped tight around my throat while he drives his cock in and out of my tight little pussy. He just grinned, released one hand off my throat so he could flip my father the bird, and slammed forward one final time before he dumped his huge load inside me. 

Fast forward a few weeks, and I was now “dating” Darius, though really he just fucks me in depraved, rough, nasty ways all over the house and the office day and night, and it brings us to now. 

**”LISTEN TO THE SOUND OF ME DESTROYING YOUR DUMB FUCKING BITCH OF A DAUGHTER YOU FUCKING LOSER!!”** Darius roared as he grabbed a fistful of my hair, pulling on it hard like reins as he fucked my ass raw as hard as he could, taunting my father the whole time. **”TELL HIM, WHORE! TELL HIM YOU LOVE MY COCK MORE THAN HIM!”**

“I love your big monster cock daddy!” I cried out between my moans and grunts. Darius made it very clear I was to call him daddy, especially around my father. “Mmm I love it so much more than anything or anyone, especially my loser old dad!”

My name is Careese Hylton- Ledgister and I am a graduate student at the University of Ottawa. I am currently in an applied sports psychology program, training to become a mental performance consultant. As a mental performance consultant (MPC), my job is to help athletes, exercises, and every day people improve their performance, consistency in activity and obtain optimal well-being respectively. Being an MPC entails teaching mental skills which include topics such as; self-awareness, positive self-talk, motivation, focus, goal-setting, imagery, and stress management (etc.). For my program, I am required to obtain 400 hours of internship experience working in this position. I believe that athletes, exercise, and everyday individuals can benefit from this type of training, which is why I am offering my services to all of you! Session would be conducted over Skype, Facetime, in person etc. A typical session will normally last 45 minutes to 1 hour. If you are interested in receiving free mental performance consulting, or have any additional questions, please send me an email at \[chylt103@uottawa.ca\].

In your email provide me a little information about you, your sport/exercise/ daily life activities and what you hope to get out of this experience.

Below is some additional information about me, mental performance consulting, and what you can expect to gain from this experience. Look forward to hearing from you!

**About Me**

My name is Careese Hylton- Ledgister, and I am a graduate student in the Master of Human Kinetics program at the University of Ottawa. I am currently doing my internship, and in training to become a Mental Performance Consultant (MPC). I have Bachelor’s degree in Psychology, and I am also certified as a Mental Health First Aid provider from the Mental Health Commission of Canada. I am a former recreational badminton and track athlete, as well as a former group fitness trainer. My goal as and MPC is to provide you with support and techniques to improve and excel in your sport/ physical activity/and everyday life. 

It is very important to me to develop strong relationships with the people that I work with, because it allows the work we do together to be the most effective. 

**What is a Mental Performance Consultant?**

An MPC is similar to a sports psychologist. The main distinction between the two is that sports psychologists make clinical diagnosis (i.e. depression) and focus on performance, whereas MPCs just focus on performance. The job of an MPC is to help increase the likelihood that athletes will perform optimally when they need to, in sport and in life. We help athletes accomplish this by teaching them various mental skills. Gaining self-awareness, thinking more positively, goal setting, improving focus, and enhancing self-regulation strategies are some of the many skills that can be learned while working with an MPC. The goal is to teach, inform, and support athletes in the practice of these mental skills for optimal performance and living. We can accomplish these goals through individual and/or group consultations, as well as mental skills workshops.

Note: MPCs are not clinical psychologists and therefore cannot diagnose and treat mental disorders.

**Example Discussion Topics**

• Maintaining focus during competitions.

• Confidence issues.

• Creating pre/post performance routines.

• Motivation.

• How to make effective competition plans.

• How to manage emotions during competitions or stressful events.

• Managing distractions.

• Managing negative thoughts.

• Implementing positive self-talk.

• Learning various relaxation techniques.

• Integrating visualization/imagery into training.

• Learning how to set effective goals (short and long-term)."
9bcauk,4,2018-08-29,"Starting out as a technician to gain experience to get into the control engineering field, is it a bad idea?",Vnslover,PLC,https://www.reddit.com/r/PLC/comments/9bcauk/starting_out_as_a_technician_to_gain_experience/,"I have posted here before to ask for advice on how to get into the controls engineering field as an entry level. I graduated with a computer engineering degree in May and been job hunting with no luck. I'm very interested in the controls field, I've had a 3 months internship with a nuclear company where I have worked on an HMI, and ever since then I have been very passionate for this field. 

I have applied to over a 100 companies in the past month and not a single one even asked me for an interview, I saw almost non entry level job postings. 

So here is the thing, some people suggested that I start out as a tech to gain experience so that I can be a controls engineer in the future, and I honestly don't mind at all, but here is the thing, I was researching this topic and it seems like many redditors in r/engineering and r/askengineers are completely against this idea saying that this will destroy your career and make future employers look down on you for not being able to get an engineering job after school. 

I have seen a lot of arrogance and hostility towards technicians, who were called ""engineer slaves"" and all that, plus many people suggested that by working as a tech first, if you managed to get into the engineering field your salary will be lower than other engineers since they take into consideration your last job salary which is lower for a tech. 

Reading all that made me very hesitant, but at the same time i don't see that I have a chance to start as a controls engineer with my kind of experience. 

I would appreciate any feedback on this matter. I have been asked to come for an interview as an automation technician for a company, but I also noticed that their pay is very bad, I saw engineering techs positions for that company on glassdoor that get paid $15/hr. What do you guys think?"

For background I'm a sophomore at the U. I'm curious about how much knowledge you should know before applying for internships. I know for a lot of computer science internships they will ask a lot of questions involving algorithms and Data Structures. Except I am taking the courses to learn the basics of that this semester. I have done some self studying over the summer with data structures, but I don't think I'm confident enough to be able to solve problems with that in any technical interview.

What my question is that will internships realize that I have yet to take my classes regarding those topics and give me some leeway?

If not, would it even make sense to apply for internships now due to I don't have that knowledge?

I'd like to get a summer internship so I get can some real world knowledge just not sure how to proceed. I've been dreading doing applications for internships because I feel like I'm unprepared or setting myself up for failure. 

Any advice would be appreciated!"

It all stared several years ago when I started out as an intern for your company and worked my way up. Now I’m the VP of Marketing and I’ve single handedly double your profits over the last two years. Helping you rebuild your company. Being the person that was able to put your vision to work. 

Naturally, we’ve spent a lot of time together. Our chemistry undeniable. Like magnets until we finally gave in 4 months ago.

Tonight is huge for the company. A big investor dinner for our clients. Your wife had insisted on coming and you only told me right before. I’m pissed but I still only want you. Our time together is rushed and secret but our chemistry is real. I think tonight I’m finally realizing that I want more than sex.

1.  Is it the same as other summer leadership programs where you are given the internship on the spot? Or would I have to interview again in the fall?

9bdchq,0,2018-08-29,What I Want to Happen In A4 (SPOILERS!),cvmvinas,marvelstudios,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/9bdchq/what_i_want_to_happen_in_a4_spoilers/,"TL;DR Too many people rewrote their stories unknowingly because Thanos having the Infinity Stones and using the Time Stone (tampering the natural law) provided a rift in the..natural law and the only way to fix it permanently is having Steve Rogers go back to WW2 AGAIN 2x to their fight with Red Skull and force himself to leave/live in that timeline for all of them to win, without knowing what they actually won.

Really, just a rundown of things that I have on my mind lately. 

* Thanos uses the Time Stone to resurrect the broken Mind Stone on Vision's head. Cue Mordo's line : *The bill comes due* 
* ***Thanos originally messes up the timeline. (take note of this)***
* Ant-Man enters the time vortex. Ends up in A1 Battle of New York, after Tony luckily got out of the wormhole and revived by Hulk. He explains that he is 'displaced' in time and must find a way back to his original timeline all while being tempted to look at his self and his, I'm assuming, family life with Cassie and Judy Greer/wife (forgot her name). Ant-Man doesn't interact with them though, he tried to look at them from afar. But he decides to approach Hank Pym...
* ***Scott also messed up the timeline (innocently, I might add, since he just wants to get back to his original timeline)***
* Avengers 4 title card appears. Blahblahblah... This happened immediately after the events of A3, give or take 3-6 hours. Everyone would be in chaos if everyone is disappearing after all, and that's a good story to tackle for Marvel.
* Tony and Nebula rides the Benatar to head back to Earth. Nebula pilots the ship, since he knows alien tech better than Stark, duh. But as they enter the Earth's atmosphere, they are attacked by Captain Marvel. They begin to fight on a land somewhere and decides to halt when Captain Marvel mentions Fury. (Note that Stark doesn't know that Fury was 'snapped')
* Somewhere in Wakanda, everyone regroups and tries to grasp whatever happened. M'Baku, Okoye and Shuri are now the acting rulers of the King. Some verbal fight ensues including Rhodey who needs to report back to America to make sure everything hasn't gone to sh333t (LANGUAGE!). The 3 (Okoye, Shuri, M'Baku) agreed to help using their tech and deploys their jets, ready to send aid to all.
* While Rhodey went on to report to whoever is in charge of America... Stark heads back to Pepper's house to see if she was okay. She was and decides to meet up with Rogers and the gang. Small talk, comment on what happened, who was Thanos and what did he do to Buck blahblahblah. Stark can say that he met Dr. Strange, Thor can quip that I know him, he's a magician. Stark can say that there was the only way to win was to lose this fight. Cap's rhetoric can go, lose this fight, *aand everyone!!*.. Avengers are broken up but there still a glimpse of hope from Captain Marvel, Rocket, Nebula.
* We jump forward to all the OG6 talking about what Strange told Stark about that 1 in 14 million win that they needed. That we are the endgame now. Blahblah. It was the only way..
* **1 year later**
* Stark is still baffled with what to do and with the help of Hulk, Capt Marvel, the best they can think of is use the BARF technology to contact their former selves and capture the stones when they first interacted it. Around this time, Ant-Man, who is working with Hank Pym, Darren Cross and Hope are working on how to go into the future to help Scott.
* ***They are messing up the timeline even more***
* So, the gist is now in Captain America v Red Skull, after the Space Stone fell of the plane, they caught it mid-air. Then they proceed to jump onto timelines and retrieving the Stones without actually rethinking the consequences. (They are messed up in this movie)
* After getting back in their 1 year later timeline, the last stone they need is Soul Stone, so Hawkeye sacrifices himself for the team (Note that Thor is a master at using the Bifrost and can go to a lot of places now, not just the 9 realms)
* Everyone got back. Yay!
* Stark anxiously asks Strange if this is the way that he asked him to do. Strange replies that the future he sought was one where everyone lives and only one dies (Hawkeye). After that, he recounted that back on Titan, the 1 win he saw was he again fought the Mad Titan in all its glory but 'looked away' as he thought that that was the end of his life and he was scared. (Remember when Mantis pointed it out, ""Does your friend often do that?"" and when Strange broke out of the spell, he was shocked and needed aid from Tony. That's this scene)
* So, one person to save the lives of countless beings of the Universe. Capt Rogers still disagrees. The Barton family doesn't have a father figure in their life. :(
   * Strange says no time to mourn because Thanos will attack us. Two infinity gauntlets with one sans Time Stone because Strange takes it back, complete roster (sans Hawkeye, but c'mon, what the hell will he do? and Ant-Man is missing cause he will be coming back from the past)
   * Fight starts and everyone is still toast. Natasha will be the one to go (I don't know how, just kill her off). Cap calls out what to do. Drax, being hotheaded, goes head on and dies from the blade that Thanos uses. (the one from the concept art). Sam goes, too. Then Rhodey and Ant-Man/Hank Pym and then Rescue/Pepper Potts, then Iron Man goes apeshit crazy and he goes, too. Captain Marvel and Hulk can hold their own but gets knocked out, not killed.
   * Strange sees that this is still not enough and all the while trying to remember what is the next to his plan. 
   * Ant-Man/Scott Lang arrives and thus created a bigger rift. Beings from all corners of the Universe began to feel this rift as well. (PF, SS, Galactus, other stuff, maybe the Gold People in GotG2, hell, throw Graviton in their hahaha)
* Then, Strange has the and as the fight still continues in the background, with Captain Marvel just barely fighting along with Nebula, Rocket, Ant-Man, Thor and others.. he feels the rift in space-time (from the six timelines they messed up, plus Thanos using the Time Stone at the end of A3, plus Scott using the Time Vortex) and calls out Tony and Cap and the only way redo all this mistake, yeah it was a mistake all the hardwork that Tony and the others did was a mistake in Strange's eyes, was to correct it from the start. 
* Just as Carol Danvers runs out of breath, Strange, Cap, and Tony heads to Cap v Red Skull fight with the Quinjet right below it. They are aboard the Hydra Ship and in the Mirror Dimension.
* ""I'm sorry, Cap. I'm still not sure what the consequences will bring but I have to save lives."" As they witness Cap's final sacrifice in the end of CA:TFA
* Tony says sorry to Cap. Tony and Strange drops him on Peggy's dance. ""This was Earth's first sign that they were ready for a higher form of war.""
* Cut back to Hulk (Last Man Standing) and Thanos fight where, in an effort to distract them, reverts back to Banner. He says 'We were not a team, we're a chemical mixture that defeated you, Thanos. We're a time bomb"".
* Cut to white screen.
* Cue a montage of Peggy and Steve happily dancing. To a Thanos that is frantic that everything he built is for nothing. To a bragging Banner that you started this, when you used the Time Stone on Vision's head. This is payback pal. Cut back to Peggy and Steve discussing with SSR to rename them SHIELD. Cut to a drinking scene with the Howling Commandos and a Steve Rogers who got his life back and retained all of his memories. 
* Cut to a Hank Pym that Steve worked closely during his final years as a SHIELD agent. One who worked closely to Hank and advised him that he should give the mantle back to someone when the time comes, so will he. (Bucky/Sam foreshadowing picking up the mantle for Captain America) Cut to Sam Wilson, having high honors on his paramilitary school and Steve backhandedly gives Sam the mantle through Bucky.
* It ends with an elderly Steve, experiencing the Battle of New York thru his home with an aged Peggy Carter. This time, Bucky is still the Winter Soldier, Sam is now Captain America, War Machine joined the Battle alongside Stark, Hulk, Thor but with Proxima and Corvus Glaive, who are standing in for Loki (since Loki was imprisoned on Asgard)
* Cut to them having fewer and far between fights from then on, but hangout from time to time. No new Avengers because most of the Avengers are now ""family"" family. Everyone will be there, except for Wanda and Pietro (we need to make way for MUTANTS), they never died because Sokovia was leveled, not turned into a meteorite. 
* GotG 1 and 2 still happened but only Ronan, no Thanos being his master thing. Gamora still escaped from Thanos' clutch. Drax'll still be there since Thanos' planet Titan was just recently destroyed. Ragnarok still happened as well as SM:HC and Black Panther coming out of Wakanda (this works because BP won't be in the final fight with the Mad Titan, he'll be back, checking all of his associates. Hank passes the mantle to Scott, as well as Janet for Hope.

Present Day - Wedding Day

* Everyone is here, including the X-Cons disguised as baristas/waiters. Just cram them in there. Maybe Peter Parker is now an intern at Daily Bugle? Make it feel organic. But don't let Quill attend this wedding. Let Quill, Gamora, and the rest go to Quill's mom's grave. Let them have their goodbyes though, before the ceremony starts. A WW2 Veteran sits near the altar, but not to near, since he's Cap who wants to live a quiet life and just wants to attend a wedding ceremony.
* Thanos is captured and thrown in the Raft, facing Abomination. While they have the Stones (the original one), they decide to part with it. In this timeline, Hawkeye is alive, so yeah, OG6 having stones of their one but being trained agents of SHIELD, they opt not to hold one. Some were broken, other were kept. (Illuminati foreshadowing for Strange, and Stark, and idk Namor in the near future...) 
* Banner and Hulk both part ways. Hulk opts to go to Sakaar and hitches a ride with the Guardians new ship (call it GunnSlither just to rub it in.) and Thor hints that he will rebuild Asgard and needs help from his friends (Valkyrie, Korg) and uses the Bifrost to escape. Tony and Hawkeye retires and gets back to their families. Banner and Natasha retires, too. With Cap nearing his final days, and Thor is a galaxies away, The New Avengers emerge, (War Machine, Winter Soldier, Captain America (Sam), Spider-Man, Ant-Man, Wasp, Captain Marvel) with Dr. Strange and Black Panther as close allies/unofficial members.
* End Credits

TL;DR Too many people rewrote their stories unknowingly because Thanos having the Infinity Stones and using the Time Stone (tampering the natural law) provided a rift in the..natural law and the only way to fix it permanently is having Steve Rogers go back to WW2 AGAIN 2x to their fight with Red Skull and force himself to leave/live in that timeline for all of them to win.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: The Vision wasn't made because the Mind Stone was taken from the 2nd Gauntlet. Cap Rogers going back a 2nd time on Cap v Red Skull finale was meant to close the rift that opened up when Tony messes up the timeline trying to fix it. That's time travel for ya"

In fact this is one of the more manageable ones. 

I am in the midst of ending my internship in a corporate company and I have been working on a presentation which I'm supposed to present tomorrow for at least a month now. Of course in the mean time I have also been doing other as hoc tasks but they aren't as near as heavy duty that could objectively affect my main work. 

I also have a paper to finish that I was supposed to assist an exec with due last 2 Fridays, but apparently I have been away from work for at least 7 days now, minus the weekend because I was just so anxious that I couldn't finish any of these tasks. At all. 

I feel stupid and incompetent. And worst of all I am also contemplating of not coming on my last day where my boss and my other colleagues already planned a nice farewell for me. 

I do not understand why can I let such a small thing affect me in such a huge way. 

I am tired and I feel horrible. I have been on my bed for way longer than I should. And I can't seem to be doing anything. I have problems breathing when I overthink. But I keep overthinking. 


TL;DR, I am a huge procastinator and I lack focus. I feel like death. Help me. "
9be7ke,18,2018-08-29,Throwback To Our First Experience,roblestion,Hotwife,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hotwife/comments/9be7ke/throwback_to_our_first_experience/,"So if you’ve read my post you’ll know that my wife and I are still relatively new to the hotwife life. So far she has hooked up with her intern from work a few times (update coming soon) and a few other experiences. I thought it’d be interesting to post about our first ever experience.

So this was about over a year ago. My wife was never really into this lifestyle at first and we treated it more like dirty talk and role playing. I’d wanted to put it into action for a while at the time. When we’d go to bars I’d purposely step away and allow men to hit on her and afterwards joke with her that she should have given them her number. Anywho, we have 2 very close friends who are married and are actually swingers. They attend swinging events and are very into the lifestyle. We hung out at their house one night and started talking about those experiences after a few drinks. My wife blurted out that I’d talked about her and another man before. The female friend of ours told her it’s normal and that if e tried it we should start small and see how we feel without jumping in. This was the first time my wife didn’t treat it as a joke and was actively listening.

That night we talked about it on the way home. I asked what she thought and she said they’re(our friends) are crazy and laughed. Then my wife asked how serious I am about it. I said I wouldn’t mind trying stuff. She said she definitely would start small and see how it went if we did it, I was super excited but didn’t press the issue as I wanted it to be casual and not stressful or pressured. 

That weekend we decided to go out to a reggae theme bar / club that we’ve never been too. As we were talking about the night I asked if she’d want to try some hotwufe stuff. After some silence she asked like what? We had a lengthy discussion about what we were comfortable with and we both insisted that if the other person felt weird we’d stop immediately. We also made it clear this is for our pleasure mutually. (I recommend anyone considering hotwife life to have an open talk like this. My wife and I are very much in love and would never hurt one another or make each other uncomfortable) anywho, we agreed to let some guys check her out and see the attention she got and maybe some flirting. Basically let things happen. we decided that she would wear this revealing black dress she bought on a whim that she felt was too racy. The dress was cut low, skin tight, had no back and came to right below her butt. I also encouraged her to wear a thong as I’d wanted to see if guys noticed.

On the way to the bar I wasrock hard and almost shaking with anticipation. I could tell she was nervous too but we both felt good not a bad nervous. Before we went in we made out in the car and my wife grabbed me through my pants and I touched her a bit. We are now both turned on. We walked in and ordered drinks and hung out. I noticed a few guys check her out and some guys staring. I told her she’s getting attention and she smiled. I found us a table near the band that was performing and my wife sat down as I went to get drinks for us. The bar was busy so it took a while as I looked back at my wife I noticed you could almost see her ass cheeks in the dress and I saw guys noticing as well. A few minutes later I looked over and a tall Hispanic man our age (late 20s) was now talking to my wife. I wondered what was going on as I saw her texting during the convo. I looked down and my wife texted me saying that this guy had asked her to dance. I replied saying that didn’t take long and I told her to go for it if she feels comfortable. She wrote back saying she will. I replied telling her to go with the flow and enjoy. I watched as they made there way to the dance floor.

I got our drinks and walked to a different table with a better view of the dance floor and sat down. I was in awe as I saw my sexy wife slowly grinding into this man on the dance floor. The music was upbeat but slow reggae so intimate dancing was happening everywhere. I noticed the man was now grabbing her by the hips as she continued to grind /dance  into him. My wife looked at me and smiled I smiled back. The man then turned her around and they danced face to face with their bodies touching. I was so turned on watching my wife in her sexy dress playing with this stranger. I noticed her dress was up a bit and only imagined how hard the guy must be. 

A few minutes past and the song changed to a faster paced song. I noticed the man getting close to my wife’s lips but she turned her face and he slowly kissed her cheek. She turned and looked at me almost asking me how I felt. I gave her a head nod of approval lol. She then turned back to him and he tried to kiss her again. This time, my wife let him do it! I almost came right then and there watching my wife press her lips against another mans! It started slow but soon the kiss turned passionate and I saw his tongue explore her mouth and hers return the favor. He ran his hands down to her ass and squeezed while they kissed. I loved it! They continued to kiss stopping for a few seconds ever now and then and pop kissing in between. Once the song ended, they stopped kissing and the guy asked her for something but my wife excused herself and came back to me.

My wife was shaking and red wondering if I’d be mad. I told her immediately how hot that was for me and she smiled saying she can’t believe that just happened. We decided to leave and process the night. When we got to the car we started making out immediately and my wife climbed on top of me. We decided to rush home and get into bed! When we got home we both raced to the bedroom and got undressed. My wife started sucking me but I stopped her and I told her to tell me everything that happened. We began to have sex as she told me that the guy was getting really hard when she was dancing with him and she could feel him growing right between her ass cheeks. She said he kept calling her baby and kissing her neck which I didn’t notice. She said during the kiss he had his tongue in her mouth the whole time. I asked if she was wet and she said she was super horny and wanted him. She said in the middle of the kiss when they paused, he asked her to”use his tongue” she assumed this meant simulating oral sex on his tongue so she took it in her mouth and sucked on it. I still don’t know what he meant but I’m sure he enjoyed it lol. She said after the kiss he whispered for her to go to his place and have fun she said she can’t he then asked her to give him head in the bathroom but she said no. 

We both came and at this point this was the best sex we’d ever had. We both realized we really enjoyed this lifestyle and talked about exploring new options. I’m thankful we started small as it really has helped our sex life. Well that’s a blast from the past! Hope you enjoyed!"

Those were ominous words, weren't they? It's the type of saying a villain would use after they escaped their enemy. They were filled with revenge and foreboding, and Mina couldn't quite shake them because when would the next time be?

It wasn't as if they had worked out when was acceptable to vulnerably strip down and please each other. It wasn't like she had actually pleased anyone in a very long time.

Daniel was a very hard man to please. It wasn't like him to be caught in the office so routinely, but backlash from his editor, Laney, cause him to stalk the firm, sitting in the chair with his hands behind his head and elbows bent, arguing for a pitch. He didn't really have to argue, the company was half his. Half his brothers. Even so, they were under a large umbrella company, and after a few days Mina was positive he wanted to bend that umbrella over his knee and chuck it off their back deck into the ocean.

It made *next time* seem inevitably distant, which only seemed to encourage her fantasies as the days slipped by. In them she was often at his mercy, hands bound and legs spread. In them she always looked better, a flatter stomach, shaplier breasts, a freshly bare sex for him to to feast upon.

It caused her to dredge up older fantasies of them, from when they had first met and she wondered how it would feel to have him pressed into her as they covered gasps with fierce kisses in a very public setting. How it would have been to have him kiss her. Take her.

Now she knew how his lips moved over hers. The reality was much, much better compared to her concocted dreams. Potent enough, a shiver raced along her spine and she had to set the manuscript down to uncloud her mind. Only she got stuck part way between reality and fantasy, eyes glazed over and lower lip sucked into her mouth.

Startled when the door swung open she slapped the papers up to hide her face as Daniel huffed, “Perspectives meeting, conference room, let's go.”

“Okay, boss,” she said without thinking and then the entire walk across the bullpen she thought on what she had just said.

He was her boss, her employer. It was a technicality but it shown on paper and she felt a harsh blush reveal itself on her cheeks as she took a seat with a host of other editors, including Daniel's, who she sat beside.

The woman passed her a summary of the plot for Daniel's fourth book in a series and she held it up to hide her face. She had already read over this sheet several times at home, but reading it again grounded her enough to focus when Laney called the meeting to order.

“So, everyone's read through this, what is missing?”

“A comma in sentence three.”

“A better title.”

“Rip me to shreds people, god.” Daniel joked and cast his steely gaze around the room. “Laney thinks romance is missing between the captain and his once prisoner. This is a man who killed her brother in book one, took her hostage, and blew up the capital building on her planet.”

“Point made,” Laney argued. “This is also the man who saved her ass from becoming an experiment at the hands of her father *and* brother. And she is the woman who gave up her title and broke the most wanted criminals from prison, and then held a gun to her own father's head. Plus they flirt.”

Daniel shrugged, “So, we flirt.” He gestured to Mina making her face turn from crimson to pale in an instant as she floundered, realizing now would be a very bad time to reveal what else they had been doing.

“Leave me out of this,” she tried to smile and dismiss the comment.

“You're a sitting duck,” he argued, “Look, we live together. We've seen our rounds of tension. I'm no nearer falling for her than I am the next stranger who walks through these doors.”

“But the fans want a romance. The polls don't lie.

Can't you talk some sense into him,” Laney flagrantly asked Mina, “You do live with him.”

“My point exactly. I am no less wrapped around her finger because I live with her than Cassius is to Mercy and they have been living in the busted down hovel in space for the last three books. This isn't a romance, they are taking down an unfair, unregulated military enterprise. Let the fans have their fiction, romance would spoil the series. Plus Cassius dies.”

The room broke out into an intense bout of exchanges, arguing over his proclamation - one she new from the very beginning. His eyes went to hers and he gave her a wink. She swore the world could see.

Laney let out a defeated sigh. “Can you at least have them fuck each other?”

Mina had to look away then, unable to see the concentrated smugness on Daniel's face as he simply said, “Maybe. You'll have to wait to find out. Adjourned.”

The crowd dispersed, Laney calling after them - especially the interns - that no one was to let a peep out about Cassius’ death. Mina had known for years without saying a word, but she had a few for Daniel when she found him in her office, lounging in her office chair.

She was quick to close the door and frown. “Why did you have to pull me into it!”

“You're the one who told me to kill off Cassius because it gave the story a better arc.”

“Not that, you complete ass. About flirting with me,” She hissed, leaning over the table to hound him with her eyes.

“I do flirt with you.”

“No you don't, you torment me.”

Daniel gave her a half pout, his hand sliding over her, fingers crawling up her arm like vines. “Do I torment you?”

“Yes.” She swallowed deeply, mind far from the meeting and back to the daydreamy place she'd been floating.

“Good.” He spun to face her, giving her arm a tug so she drew near. “You've been torturing me too.”

“Have I?”

His hands moved up her arm, boldly across her breast, wrapping lightly around her throat for an instant. She gasped and he took advantage of her parted lips, popping his thumb in her mouth.

Mina knew he hadn't found release, at least not through her, so when she sucked on his finger she gave him a little show, questioning where the boldness had come from. It was rewarded by a low groan as she took his whole thumb into her mouth before releasing it with a little nibble.

“Not at work,” she said quickly and moved away from him. “You're technically my boss. I think this breaks some sort of rule.”

“And you love the rules.” There was mischief in his eyes. “I have a few rules for you.”

Her throat went dry, his words had a pull on her even more roughly than hands. That timber, it made her panties intently begin to grow damp “What are they?”

“Rule one, look at me.”

Mina turned and looked, her nipples hardening until he could see them strain against the thin pink of her blouse. She wondered how she looked to him, was it as good as he made her feel?

“Rule two, come here.”

Mina stood before him.

“Rule three, get on your knees.”

She folded her body, skirt riding up as her knees hit the floor with a full thud. The sound her heart made echoed in her ears as she looked eagerly up at him with dark and questioning eyes.

“What if we get caught?”

“You think I want to get caught, it would discredit my whole argument then I'd lose a battle and have to restructure the last two books.” As he spoke his hand caressed her face, the thumb she had sucked moving across her plump lips.

There was no thinking of fantasy then, the reality too raw as her hands went to his thighs and worked up the material of his jeans until she found his erection straining.

“I didn't lock the door.”

“Then we better not make too much noise.”

She had already given in despite her argument, addicted to the way Daniel looked at her expectantly. No one had in far too long? Or had he always?

Her hand went to the buttons and zipper. He was wearing tight boxer briefs, the length of him pressed into the material, a shadow of the real thing she had seen not too long ago.

Preferring to expose him fully, hard cock and balls, she peeled down the elastic and he lifted himself enough she could tug the material until full access was granted. She watched as she took his cock in her hand for the first time, memorizing how it felt from curved shaft to swollen head.

They had only been in her room for minutes and already he was leaking precum. How long had he been thinking of doing this? Since their kitchen encounter?

Mina had always enjoy sucking cock, rarely the opportunity arose for her so when she saw the glistening moisture she didn't want to waste it on her fingers. Wrapping a hand around the base she heard his soft grunt and his their eyes met.

She knew just how to get to him. She always had.

Her mouth moved toward his shaft, lips nearly brushing the skin as her breath washed over him. “Rule four. Tell me rule four.”

The hand that had been softly caressing her wove into her hair, gripping it. He rumbled, “Rule four….suck my cock, Mina.”

The flat of her tongue lapped against the bead of precum. Then again, starting down the length and working up. She pressed just hard enough against the underside to draw a noise from deep in Daniel's throat, before she slid her lips over the moistened head.

One hand was still at the base, her other dug into his thigh for balance as she began to work down his length in teasing tastes, tongue doing most of the work. She felt him grow stiffer and rewarded that by adding suction and a soft moan of her own.

She wasn't thinking about decorum, other than keeping things muffled. Her attention was directed to the stiff cock she had in her mouth. She pushed saliva out from under her lips, until he was coated as far as she could take him. Only then did she sweep the hand around his thickness up, gathering the lubricant she had provided and began to work him with her hand paired with her mouth.

The effect was gratifying. The hand in her hair seized and she noticed how his knuckles went white on the hand gripping the arm of her chair. His dampened grunts mingled with the sloppy sounds of her mouth.

Her whole body moved as her lips parted over his cock, the suction greater as she pulled away, hungry for him. Part of her assumed he would have been more forcefully. Part of her might have even hoped.

Part of her knew she would take him again in her mouth at their house when she didn't have an office filled with people ready to witness more than they bargained for - she couldn't believe he had so easily gotten her on her knees.

Willingly she tried to take him just that much deeper, relaxing her jaw and flattening on her her tongue so the swollen head of his cock hit back of her throat. Lips met her curled fingers and she kept him deep, groaning as she did to add to the height of the moment.

“Fuck….” He hissed, lips contorted as he forced himself to play by her unspoken rule for near silence. “Rule five, look at me as I cum.”

Knowing he was close she sped up, bringing the tight ring of her mouth up and down his shaft with exaggerated strokes and dizzying speed. It was hard to focus on his face, but Mina never drew her gaze from his.

His nostrils flared and body shifted, hips moving as she felt his cock twitch in her mouth. She pulled up quickly as the first shot of his cum released, letting it pool as her tongue worked the sensitive underside of his head.

He broke just slightly as she did, letting out one cracked groan like a shot fired, his hand as hard as she craved on the back of her head, keeping her steady as he finished, blue eyes attached to hers. There was a new tension between them, the kind that formed only during intimacy. It made her breathless.

Gulping, she swallowed his seed. He released her and she sat back on aching legs, licking at her swollen lips.

Her voice was shaky as reality came back to her, acutely aware to how she had made a mess of her panties and how badly she wanted his fingers to slip the material to the side. Wanting this badly was reckless. What a fool she had been, losing control in her safe space for the merciless man before her.

Panting, she turned on him. “Rule six, pull up your pants and get out of my office.”

He nodded, not daring to speak or maybe there was just nothing to say that would make any sense. Instead, Daniel held his hand out for her and aided her onto wobbly legs before he tucked his softening cock into his boxers and fascnented his trousers.

Mina was quick to remove her hand from his, leaning against the desk as she pretended to be fascinated by the clutter instead of how he slowly crept to the door like a naughty boy having been caught stealing cookies. They could have been caught!

Instead she caught that he had restructured a sequence in the manuscript she had been working on, his changes in blue ink and initialed. Quickly she threw a pen at him.

“You do not just come in my office and correct my corrections! Out, get out!”

He made haste of the handle as he thrust the door open, the moment of tension seeming to slip into something more bearable between them as her intern bustled past the open door and frantically said, “Ms. Abbott, are you alright?” And more reverently, “Mr. Reed?”

“All good,” Daniel kept laughing. “Just a little light flirting she couldn't handle.”

He departed and this time she did chase him into the bullpen, yelling curses to his back until he was gone, the whole time aching to let every dirty word she knew leave her mouth as he thrust into her.

Next time, she was going to know how it felt to come undone around his cock."

The room broke out into an intense bout of exchanges, arguing over his proclamation - one she new from the very beginning. His eyes went to hers and he gave her a wink. She swore the world could see.

Laney let out a defeated sigh. “Can you at least have them fuck each other?”

Mina had to look away then, unable to see the concentrated smugness on Daniel's face as he simply said, “Maybe. You'll have to wait to find out. Adjourned.”

The crowd dispersed, Laney calling after them - especially the interns - that no one was to let a peep out about Cassius’ death. Mina had known for years without saying a word, but she had a few for Daniel when she found him in her office, lounging in her office chair.

She was quick to close the door and frown. “Why did you have to pull me into it!”

“You're the one who told me to kill off Cassius because it gave the story a better arc.”

“Not that, you complete ass. About flirting with me,” She hissed, leaning over the table to hound him with her eyes.

“I do flirt with you.”

“No you don't, you torment me.”

Daniel gave her a half pout, his hand sliding over her, fingers crawling up her arm like vines. “Do I torment you?”

“Yes.” She swallowed deeply, mind far from the meeting and back to the daydreamy place she'd been floating.

“Good.” He spun to face her, giving her arm a tug so she drew near. “You've been torturing me too.”

“Have I?”

His hands moved up her arm, boldly across her breast, wrapping lightly around her throat for an instant. She gasped and he took advantage of her parted lips, popping his thumb in her mouth.

Mina knew he hadn't found release, at least not through her, so when she sucked on his finger she gave him a little show, questioning where the boldness had come from. It was rewarded by a low groan as she took his whole thumb into her mouth before releasing it with a little nibble.

“Not at work,” she said quickly and moved away from him. “You're technically my boss. I think this breaks some sort of rule.”

“And you love the rules.” There was mischief in his eyes. “I have a few rules for you.”

Her throat went dry, his words had a pull on her even more roughly than hands. That timber, it made her panties intently begin to grow damp “What are they?”

“Rule one, look at me.”

Mina turned and looked, her nipples hardening until he could see them strain against the thin pink of her blouse. She wondered how she looked to him, was it as good as he made her feel?

“Rule two, come here.”

Mina stood before him.

“Rule three, get on your knees.”

She folded her body, skirt riding up as her knees hit the floor with a full thud. The sound her heart made echoed in her ears as she looked eagerly up at him with dark and questioning eyes.

“What if we get caught?”

“You think I want to get caught, it would discredit my whole argument then I'd lose a battle and have to restructure the last two books.” As he spoke his hand caressed her face, the thumb she had sucked moving across her plump lips.

There was no thinking of fantasy then, the reality too raw as her hands went to his thighs and worked up the material of his jeans until she found his erection straining.

“I didn't lock the door.”

“Then we better not make too much noise.”

She had already given in despite her argument, addicted to the way Daniel looked at her expectantly. No one had in far too long? Or had he always?

Her hand went to the buttons and zipper. He was wearing tight boxer briefs, the length of him pressed into the material, a shadow of the real thing she had seen not too long ago.

Preferring to expose him fully, hard cock and balls, she peeled down the elastic and he lifted himself enough she could tug the material until full access was granted. She watched as she took his cock in her hand for the first time, memorizing how it felt from curved shaft to swollen head.

They had only been in her room for minutes and already he was leaking precum. How long had he been thinking of doing this? Since their kitchen encounter?

Mina had always enjoy sucking cock, rarely the opportunity arose for her so when she saw the glistening moisture she didn't want to waste it on her fingers. Wrapping a hand around the base she heard his soft grunt and his their eyes met.

She knew just how to get to him. She always had.

Her mouth moved toward his shaft, lips nearly brushing the skin as her breath washed over him. “Rule four. Tell me rule four.”

The hand that had been softly caressing her wove into her hair, gripping it. He rumbled, “Rule four….suck my cock, Mina.”

The flat of her tongue lapped against the bead of precum. Then again, starting down the length and working up. She pressed just hard enough against the underside to draw a noise from deep in Daniel's throat, before she slid her lips over the moistened head.

One hand was still at the base, her other dug into his thigh for balance as she began to work down his length in teasing tastes, tongue doing most of the work. She felt him grow stiffer and rewarded that by adding suction and a soft moan of her own.

She wasn't thinking about decorum, other than keeping things muffled. Her attention was directed to the stiff cock she had in her mouth. She pushed saliva out from under her lips, until he was coated as far as she could take him. Only then did she sweep the hand around his thickness up, gathering the lubricant she had provided and began to work him with her hand paired with her mouth.

The effect was gratifying. The hand in her hair seized and she noticed how his knuckles went white on the hand gripping the arm of her chair. His dampened grunts mingled with the sloppy sounds of her mouth.

Her whole body moved as her lips parted over his cock, the suction greater as she pulled away, hungry for him. Part of her assumed he would have been more forcefully. Part of her might have even hoped.

Part of her knew she would take him again in her mouth at their house when she didn't have an office filled with people ready to witness more than they bargained for - she couldn't believe he had so easily gotten her on her knees.

Willingly she tried to take him just that much deeper, relaxing her jaw and flattening on her her tongue so the swollen head of his cock hit back of her throat. Lips met her curled fingers and she kept him deep, groaning as she did to add to the height of the moment.

“Fuck….” He hissed, lips contorted as he forced himself to play by her unspoken rule for near silence. “Rule five, look at me as I cum.”

Knowing he was close she sped up, bringing the tight ring of her mouth up and down his shaft with exaggerated strokes and dizzying speed. It was hard to focus on his face, but Mina never drew her gaze from his.

His nostrils flared and body shifted, hips moving as she felt his cock twitch in her mouth. She pulled up quickly as the first shot of his cum released, letting it pool as her tongue worked the sensitive underside of his head.

He broke just slightly as she did, letting out one cracked groan like a shot fired, his hand as hard as she craved on the back of her head, keeping her steady as he finished, blue eyes attached to hers. There was a new tension between them, the kind that formed only during intimacy. It made her breathless.

Gulping, she swallowed his seed. He released her and she sat back on aching legs, licking at her swollen lips.

Her voice was shaky as reality came back to her, acutely aware to how she had made a mess of her panties and how badly she wanted his fingers to slip the material to the side. Wanting this badly was reckless. What a fool she had been, losing control in her safe space for the merciless man before her.

Panting, she turned on him. “Rule six, pull up your pants and get out of my office.”

He nodded, not daring to speak or maybe there was just nothing to say that would make any sense. Instead, Daniel held his hand out for her and aided her onto wobbly legs before he tucked his softening cock into his boxers and fascnented his trousers.

Mina was quick to remove her hand from his, leaning against the desk as she pretended to be fascinated by the clutter instead of how he slowly crept to the door like a naughty boy having been caught stealing cookies. They could have been caught!

Instead she caught that he had restructured a sequence in the manuscript she had been working on, his changes in blue ink and initialed. Quickly she threw a pen at him.

“You do not just come in my office and correct my corrections! Out, get out!”

He made haste of the handle as he thrust the door open, the moment of tension seeming to slip into something more bearable between them as her intern bustled past the open door and frantically said, “Ms. Abbott, are you alright?” And more reverently, “Mr. Reed?”

“All good,” Daniel kept laughing. “Just a little light flirting she couldn't handle.”

He departed and this time she did chase him into the bullpen, yelling curses to his back until he was gone, the whole time aching to let every dirty word she knew leave her mouth as he thrust into her.

Next time, she was going to know how it felt to come undone around his cock."

I was a tutor. I have internship experience relevant to the field I want to work in. I've gone through at least one entire interview process consisting of a take home coding problem, 2 phone interviews, and an on-site; only to get rejected.

I ended up getting another job, and while I am thankful to have a job at all, I don't feel that it is a good match for my skill set and background, and I don't make nearly enough money to have the quality of life I would like in my current city.

I seriously don't know what the fuck it is that is stopping people from giving me a chance. I've had many people look at my resume and they all say it looks fine and are surprised I haven't gotten a job yet. I am kind of socially awkward but during interviews I never felt like that was too much of an issue. Why did I work so hard in college just to be rejected all the time while some of my peers who literally cheated and piggy backed off of my work were able to get hired for the same positions I applied for and are making significantly more money than me.

It's fucking bullshit and it makes me so upset and depressed to the point where I get suicidal. I know some of you are going to tell me to see a therapist, and I would if I could afford it. I'm just sick of this and I'm losing hope with each day."
9bejjs,32,2018-08-29,Feel like I’m getting pushed out of my degree program because of chronic pain (x-posted to r/disability),dashestodashes,ChronicPain,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/9bejjs/feel_like_im_getting_pushed_out_of_my_degree/,"This is kinda rambly and emotional, but tl;dr: professor slamming me for unprofessionalism due to the need for accommodation and suggests I wouldn’t be able to teach with this disability (or that I’m handling it wrong at least)

I’m in my fifth year of college, about to graduate with a degree in special education. I started as a biology major, but after the first year I realized I wouldn’t be able to finish because a congenital eye condition I have prevents me from seeing properly through microscopes. We tried to accommodate it with assistive tech, but it wasn’t working well enough for me to see what I needed to for assignments. I think back to this a lot and seriously question if I gave up too soon and should have sought outside help or something. 

Anyway, last year I reached out to my local vocational rehab office (which I had just learned existed) to help me get through college and be at least a little bit protected from job discrimination when I graduated or tried to find summer/part-time work. I have a great relationship with them now and they help me out immensely, but nothing will change the fact that I *do* have disabilities which can’t really be “cured” or easily fixed, if at all. 

Right now, I’m working in a high school class (kind of like an internship) before I move on to my formal student teaching in the spring. My professor and I have been butting heads (often about disability issues) this year and last year. She came to observe me in the classroom yesterday and she caught me eating my lunch in the room rather than in the cafeteria with the students and my cooperating teacher. I explained that we had an unexpectedly active morning (got locked out on the other side of the school and had to walk around to the front in 90+ degree heat) and I was in a lot of pain because of it. So I chose to stay put instead (so I could participate in everything else later in the day). 

Well, that wasn’t acceptable to her. I’m supposed to be with the students/my teacher every second of the day. I understand the rules (which had never been quite clear to be honest) and I was doing the best I could to meet those expectations. But she pressed on and on about how I can’t do stuff like this when I have my own class and I’m not being professional and I have to “just push through” the pain. And believe me, I work just as hard if not harder than all the other girls in my major; I’m not a slacker, and I have never been lazy. I sometimes struggle to get things in on time, but again it’s a disability thing (slow processing and executive functioning issues). She’s been shitting on me as well about missing class for doctors appointments, some of which take months to schedule and can’t be made outside of school hours. 

Anything I can do to be in class and be prepared and on top of things, I will do. I have as much documentation on file as I can fiscally afford to obtain. I work my ass off to get everything done like I’m supposed to, but it feels like every tiny mistake I make is blown up, while everyone else gets by so easily. 

Honestly, I worry about finishing this degree. I won’t even teach if it’s that big of a deal (though some of my loans would be forgiven if I do teach for like 5 years or so), but I need to graduate and be done and be able to get a job that makes decent money (as in, not minimum wage!). I don’t know if they’ll let me continue if I keep fucking up like this, but at the same time I feel like I can’t “work harder” or “push past it.” I’m doing the best I can! I literally have to come home and lay down every day after school because I have given all my energy to this and I have none left for myself, my fiancé, or any of our plans. Getting homework done is hard enough, forget making dinner! 

I’ve just kinda been in crisis mode all day today and yesterday because I’m just so upset about this and I don’t know what to do. I’m scared to talk to my professor more, and nobody else seems to understand. Even my fiancé is struggling to be supportive and understanding, because chronic pain and fatigue just don’t make sense when you don’t experience them. I’m angry at myself for wasting all this time and money when clearly I can’t do this. "

9bely6,44,2018-08-29,F4A An eager new intern thinks she's working at her dream job. Turns out the men there just needed a girl to relieve their stress throughout the workday.,dppgirl4black,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/9bely6/f4a_an_eager_new_intern_thinks_shes_working_at/,"I push my glasses up to my face as the last of the coffee drips into the mug.  ""Ok, you got this Kenzie, let's go!"" I whisper to myself with pure determination before picking up all four mugs of coffee and bringing them into the break room.  The guys sitting down and chatting don't even bother to say thanks as I bring them their energy for the afternoon.  Every single one does try to sneak a peak down my skirt, which is more like a pair of panties with how short it is.  Well, it's actually worse because I can feel my bare ass spilling out with every small movement I make.  I resist the urge to pull it down, just smiling as my pussy peaks out for all these guys to see.

""Hey thanks cunt,"" Jake says, and I already know he has more to add.  This asshole had been making sexist and generally derogatory remarks since I started a few days ago, so I wasn't expecting him to say anything a decent human being would say.  ""But I think you're forgetting one of the rules...always show your tits after you wait on us.""  The other guys snicker at him, and I give a forced smile as he requests this.

""Haha...I must have missed that rule in orientation,"" I said, my voice shaky.  My hands nevertheless went down to my dress shirt, the only part of my outfit that a legitimate businesswoman might wear.  Well, except for the fact that it was unbuttoned and showed enough of my tits already to let everyone know I wasn't wearing a bra.  I pulled it completely open and bared my creamy white jugs to these four assholes, smiling wide as best I could, doing my best to fight the urge to just run away.  A smack in the ass from Eric is my reward for keeping my composure, along with a ""now that's what you're here for, those stripper tits, not that dumb cunt brain.""

A tear begins to well up in my eyes even as I keep smiling. The boys laugh for a bit more and then finally turn away.  That ""dumb brain"" he's talking about got me through college with 3 majors at once, getting my MBA at only 19 years old.  I had been ready to make my way in the business world as a strong, independent woman, certain I could rise to the top in no time.

Well, that was before I had met with the VP of this branch of the company earlier this week.  He had started with my new outfit, the one I was currently wearing, and went on to explain my duties as an intern.  As he continued, it started to sound more and more like prostitution than an entry position into a company.  Well, unpaid prostitution at that, the internship had no type of compensation.  His orders included following the orders of any man working there with a smile, without hesitation.  Of course I had thrown every insult I had at this man at first, making it clear how despicable I thought he was.  

And then he calmly explained to me what would happen if I didn't play along; he would make it so that I wouldn't get hired at any other job I would ever apply for, would soon be working the streets doing exactly what he was asking me to do.  He said it was only for a few weeks, but I knew it was bullshit.  Even so, this man was incredibly powerful, and I had no doubt he could ruin my life if he wanted.

So here I was, standing in the break room with all sense of dignity out the window, being referred to by any type of slur by men who didn't care to remember my name.  Then Eric slid a glass of warm white liquid in front of me.  ""Drink it,"" he said, and I knew immediately what it was from the smell.  Three days of nonstop blowjobs and anal for the workers had made me very familiar with it.

I didn't hesitate, steeling myself to what I must do.  This is what I had to do to make my way in the world, no matter how terrible.  And I gulped down every last bit of the disgusting concoction of cum made my god knows how many men.

I struggled to swallow it all before letting out an ""Ahhhh"" and smiling widely once again at the guys.  It couldn't get any worse than this anyway, right?"
9beox8,1,2018-08-29,"Thank you for showing your true colors, K.",freefromtoxicity,UnsentLetters,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/9beox8/thank_you_for_showing_your_true_colors_k/,"Dear K,

This year has been a long series of ups and downs.  You helped me to feel the best and worst I've felt during this year.  You helped me get through when I was struggling with depression during the spring and you helped me find value in myself when I saw none.  

Due to our relationship, you had a large weight on your chest, and frankly, I carried a similar weight of guilt and remorse for what happened.  I was upset that I had made you so unhappy, stressed, and anxious. Those feelings led me into a spiral of sadness and depression.  I'm so thankful for your help and for recommending I actually pursue therapy. I say that because through therapy I realized that you were the reason I was so depressed, you were the reason I hated myself.  

Through therapy and my friends, I realized the situation was nowhere close to what it seemed to me.  You were controlling me, using me, and doing very little to help.  This summer was a perfect example of that when you confessed what happened to your fiance.  Call me selfish but your timing couldn't have been worse.  

When you sent me that message, telling me what happened and how you couldn't talk to me; it was the worst day I had had in a long time.  I felt so alone.  You were my only friend that I could talk to about my depression and you were the only friend who could make me feel happy.

You sent the message at the start of a full workday. That shift was the hardest shift I've ever worked.  After work, I had decided I would tell my parents about how depressed I was and how I had been seeing a therapist, because you couldn't be there for me anymore.  On my way home I got a flat tire, and when I called my parents to tell them, they informed me that my brother was having a crisis and was on the verge of making an attempt on his life. So I decided to wait until the next day and help my family through tough times.

The next day I was woken up to my mother sobbing and shaking me awake.  She told me  that my cousin of only 30 years old, whom I knew and played video games with during the holidays, had died of an epilepsy related seizure while his 4 year old son was home with him. 

To this day my parents still don't know what I was going through at the time.  And going into this school year I was so anxious because of how things were left off.   And when you texted me about my internship; I started crying. From sadness, happiness, anxiety and from frustration.  You said it like nothing had happened between us, which couldn't be more from the truth.  And when you approached me at school today I was nervous, so nervous.  Hearing you talk dropped my guard and it just felt natural to talk and laugh with you, just like before.  You have some cute kittens, I hope they make you happy.  

But after that, you showed me why you really wanted to talk to me.  You just wanted to know what I told our friends.  And when I said that I had confessed everything to them, you got so angry at me. You have no idea why I told them.  You have no idea why your anger hurt so much.  I confessed to them nearly a month after everything happened.  We had dinner at that Mexican place by the mall and they asked why we weren't talking to each other anymore.  When they asked that, I just started crying.  It took 10 minutes before I could calm down enough to the point where I could tell them what happened.  They were so supportive of me, and they calmed me down and even had me laughing by the end of the night. And I love them for it.  Because that night was when I actually realized how toxic you are.

Like you said, I really don't know you.  Because if I did, I never would have even been your friend.  

I hope you and your fiance have a fantastic marriage.  But please don't ever try to insert yourself back into my life.  I don't want or need the anxiety, sadness and frustration that comes with knowing you.  You are a toxic person, and I'm glad today is the day I finally got rid of you.

At 6’0 tall and with a hulking physique that was a product of a strict gym regimen, Taylor Robertson looked like a man who would be more at home on the basketball court or a rap video, than in a board room. Yet the corporate jungle was truly where he belonged. Against all odds and silent racism, he had risen to become the first black director on the board, eventually paving the way for other black men to become part of the board.

His rise to the top was not without controversy however, as his appetite for women (especially white women) had given him something of a reputation within the company. It was an open secret (among the men, at least, who spoke of the rumors with a mixture of jealousy and admiration) that he had been bedding secretaries, interns and even employees wives’. But while his detractors in the office had been desperately trying to get rid of him on charges of sexual misconduct or harassment, none of them have been able to make the charges stick since none of the alleged women would cooperate in any investigation.

Besides, his acumen for business and making profits was enough to keep most of the board happy, and they were willing to overlook his dalliances as long as he was bringing in the money. The majority of the board had been so pleased with his performance, that he was poised to become the next CEO after old man Derrickson’s retirement. Unfortunately for him, the old bastard had appointed her daughter as CEO in a move that took the entire board by surprise just this morning.

Taylor wouldn’t allow this setback the foil his plans, and immediately started planning on how to own the new CEO with his secret weapon: his monstrous black cock that every white girl in the office couldn’t have enough of, once they got their first taste. He would let her keep her title as CEO, while he would be the one behind the scenes pulling the strings as he enslaved her with his thick black cock.

After chasing her for a week, I just gave up and decided to proceed with NC. We haven't talked since then.

She went to Colombia for the entire summer to visit her family, so there wasn't too much urge for me to contact her because it felt as if she isn't here. I've had an alright summer: have been doing amazing at my internship, played soccer, got more fit, read books, got snowboarding gear for the winter. And I  thought that I was doing better.

However she's supposed to be back home around now, and I can't stop stressing, I can't stop checking my phone, and I can't stop hoping that she will contact me. My phone's battery sucks and it dies often, and whenever that happens i get stressed that i'll miss her call. 

Also the other day I had a dream, or maybe it even actually happened very early morning, I remember reading a long text and then deleting it. I don't know if it was actually a dream or if it happened or even if it was her but that also stresses me the fuck out.

I'm usually very calm and laid back person, but i've been very stressed out lately and can't stop thinking about her. I want to text her but I just can't force myself to do that, she broke up with me once before, and i just don't know, i guess i have too much pride to text her first this time. For the relationship to work, she would have to initiate it.

She ended our relationship because she thought we weren't good together, and I think big part of that was that she was also thinking that our relationship wouldn't survive her being away the entire summer.

I love her and I miss her. We've had so many incredible moments. Fuck break ups. Angsty music is the only thing keeping me sane."

NASA在其整个历史中的成功归功于许多科学家和技术专家的工作，他们为该机构的许多成功做出了贡献。 Beth A. Brown博士就是其中一个人，一个梦想从幼儿时期开始研究恒星的天体物理学家。她作为第一位获得博士学位的黑人女性的遗产在密歇根大学的天文学。 Beth Brown博士于1969年7月15日出生于弗吉尼亚州罗阿诺克，从小就对科学感兴趣。她和她的父母，弟弟和一位年长的堂兄一起长大。贝丝经常谈到她如何喜欢科学，因为她总是对某些事情的运作方式以及为什么存在某些东西感到好奇。她参加了小学和初中的科学博览会，但虽然太空让她着迷，但她选择的项目与天文学毫无关系。布朗博士在看星际迷航，星球大战以及其他关于太空的节目和电影时长大。事实上，她经常谈论星际迷航多少影响了她对太空的兴趣。她经常引用高中时通过望远镜观看环状星云作为她决定追求天文学作为职业的动力。她也有兴趣成为一名宇航员。她以优异成绩毕业于霍华德大学，并于1991年获得天体物理学学士学位，并在物理学研究生课程中待了一年。虽然她更像是一名物理专业而不是天文专业，但她决定将天文学作为一种职业，因为它引起了她的兴趣。由于D.C.离NASA很近，布朗能够在戈达德太空飞行中心做几次暑期实习，在那里她获得了研究经验。她的一位教授让她了解了成为一名宇航员所需要的以及在太空中的感受。她发现她近视的视力会伤害她成为宇航员的机会，并且在狭窄的地方不是很有吸引力。布朗接着进入了密歇根大学天文系的博士课程。她教了几个实验室，共同创建了一个关于天文学的短期课程，花时间在基特峰国家天文台（亚利桑那州）观察，在几个会议上进行了展示，并花时间在一个也有天文馆的科学博物馆工作。布朗博士于1994年获得天文学硕士学位，然后继续完成她的论文（关于椭圆星系）。 1998年12月20日，她获得了博士学位，这是第一位获得该系天文学博士学位的非洲裔美国女性。

The success of NASA throughout its history is due to the work of many scientists and technical experts who contributed to the many successes of the agency. Dr. Beth A. Brown was one of those people, an astrophysicist who dreamed of studying the stars from early childhood. Her legacy as the first black woman to receive a Ph.D. in astronomy at the University of Michigan. Dr. Beth Brown was born in Roanoke, VA on July 15, 1969, and had an interest in science from an early age. She grew up with her parents, younger brother, and an older cousin. Beth often talked about how she liked science because she was always curious about how something worked and why something existed. She participated in science fairs in elementary school and junior high, but although space fascinated her, she chose projects that had nothing to do with astronomy. Dr. Brown grew up watching Star Trek, Star Wars, and other shows and movies about space. In fact, she often talked about how much Star Trek influenced her interest in space. She often cited seeing the Ring Nebula through a telescope when she was in high school as the impetus for her decision to pursue astronomy as a career. She was also interested in being an astronaut. She attended Howard University, where she graduated summa cum laude, receiving a BS in astrophysics in 1991, and remained there for another year in the physics graduate program. Although she had been more a physics major than an astronomy major, she decided to pursue astronomy as a career because it piqued her interest. Because of D.C.’s close proximity to NASA, Brown was able to do a couple of summer internships at the Goddard Space Flight Center, where she gained research experience. One of her professors made her look into what it takes to become an astronaut and what it is like to be in space. She discovered that her near-sighted vision would hurt her chances of being an astronaut and that being in cramped quarters wasn’t very appealing. Brown next entered the doctoral program at the University of Michigan’s Department of Astronomy. She taught several labs, co-created a short course on astronomy, spent time observing at the Kitt Peak National Observatory (in Arizona), presented at several conferences, and spent time working at a science museum that also had a planetarium. Dr. Brown received her MS in Astronomy in 1994, then went on to finish her thesis (on the subject of elliptical galaxies). On December 20, 1998, she received her Ph.D., the first African-American woman to obtain a doctorate in astronomy from the department."

Everything you need to know about the game is below:
The Buffalo Bills will square off against the Chicago Bears on Thursday hoping to avoid injury above all else. The fourth and final preseason game often prominently features players who are auditioning for a spot on another roster or practice squad. While this year’s preseason finale doesn’t quite have the intimate feel of Buffalo’s traditional preseason closing matchup with the Detroit Lions, there are some connections between the two teams.

The head coaches each rose through the NFL coaching ranks together, with new Bears head coach Matt Nagy and second-year Bills head coach Sean McDermott starting their NFL careers with Andy Reid’s Philadelphia Eagles. Both men coached under Reid from 2008-2010. Nagy began as a coaching intern (2008-2009) before earning a promotion to coaching assistant for the 2010 season. McDermott was the Eagles’ linebackers coach in 2008 before he as named defensive coordinator, a position he held in 2009 and 2010 before he was fired.

Guard Vlad Ducasse and center/guard Ryan Groy each played for the Bears before coming to Buffalo. Ducasse was a Bear in 2015, playing in 15 games and making 11 starts. Groy signed with the Bears as an undrafted rookie free agent in 2014. He made 3 starts for the team and appeared in 4 games overall.

Another of Buffalo’s offensive linemen, Jordan Mills, began his career in Chicago, as well. Mills played for the Bears for his first two seasons (2013-2014) after the team drafted him in the fifth round of the 2013 NFL Draft. Mills was Chicago’s starting right tackle out of the gate, starting 29 of a possible 32 games over his first two seasons.

Two assistant coaches have connections to each team, as well. Bills’ linebackers coach Bob Babich was with the Bears from 2004-2012, serving as linebackers coach from 2004-2006, then as defensive coordinator from 2007-2009, and then again as linebackers coach from 2010-2012. Bears’ tight ends coach Kevin Gilbride is the son of longtime NFL coach (and former Bills’ offensive coordinator) Kevin Gilbride, who was a member of Gregg Williams’ staff from 2001-2003"

Are there medium-sized/small companies that are open to hiring freshers?

9bfwol,10,2018-08-29,The SureFIRE Way - A guide from age 18 to late 30's to be FI while young,NJleanfireman,leanfire,https://www.reddit.com/r/leanfire/comments/9bfwol/the_surefire_way_a_guide_from_age_18_to_late_30s/,"Here is my personal step by step guide that anyone can follow to be FI while young.  I wish someone told me this but I had to figure it out the hard way (if reading and listening to podcasts is hard).

&amp;#x200B;

**Phase 1 - Getting Established**

Age 18-22 - Go to community college for 2 years then state school for 2 years in a STEM field to maximize income and and keep debt low.  Apply for scholarships and fill out the FAFSA for aid.  Work during the winter and summer breaks at little bullshit jobs the first 2 years and get paid internships the last 2 years.  That will give you spending money and keep you out of credit card debt.  By this time you should have around $30,000 in student loan debt.

Age 22 - After graduation with a bachelor's STEM degree, you should be making $55-$70,000 a year.  Live with roommates and buy a used car for $5-$10,000 - track expenses and you will be able to save 40-50% of after tax income.  

Still Age 22 - Save $2,500 in a checking account (1 month expenses) - this will take you 2 months

Still Age 22 - Pay off the car in full with the remaining 10 months in the year and buy all your furniture for the home in cash

Age 23 - In addition to that $2,500 in your checking account, add $5,000 to a savings account and now you have a proper emergency fund of 3 months expenses - should take 4 months

Age 23-24 - Pay off that $30,000 student loan debt, totally possible with a 50% savings rate and a $70,000 pre tax income

&amp;#x200B;

**Phase 2 - Now it gets interesting**

By now you are 25 years old, totally debt free, living with roommates, used car, and a solid emergency fund.  You are doing great!  Being 3 years into your career you should see some kind of raise or promotion soon.  Keep your savings rate always at 50%, this way you can enjoy 50% of that raise and also use the other 50% to snowball your way into FI.

Priority 1 - Max the employer's 401k match if they give it.  Nothing beats that return.

Priority 2 - Buy a property - a little studio apartment or one with multiple bedrooms or units that you can rent out to others.  Plan to live in this for around 5 years.  If you have been struggling to save 50% up to this point you will feel your load lighten, and you will now be able to afford some of life's finer things.

Priority 3 - Invest in a diversified portfolio of low cost index funds.  Personally I use the Schwab ETF's with super low fees and no trading costs - symbols are SCHX, SCHM, SCHA, SCHF, SCHE, SCHH.  On average a properly balanced aggressive account should beat inflation by 7%.  So let's say in a year you invest $30,000, at a 7% return and maintaining that 50% savings rate you can give yourself a $1,000 raise every year and invest an extra $1,000 a year as well.  This way you get to have your cake and eat it too.

&amp;#x200B;

**Phase 3 - Being Retired and the 4% rule**

There are so many paths your life can take, maybe you get married and have kids or maybe you want to travel for a while before settling down.  Whatever it may be, set up a budget for your ideal life and invest 25 times what you want to spend in a year.  Once you hit that magic 25x number, it's OK for you to retire because your investments can support you forever (99% of the time).  By following my steps you will be FI by age 35-40 and then your life is finally yours.  If you want to get there a little faster, look into investing in real estate (not as easy or passive but it is rewarding).  Cheers!"

(Also applying to others like SJSU/CSUEB/UCD etc..)

&amp;#x200B;

My initial thought was SF is a great place for CS in general because of the location obviously..but does it really matter in the end if you can't end up getting an internship or job because of the school's reputation or lack of resources for students?

&amp;#x200B;

Don't get me wrong I don't have anything against SFSU, I actually WANT to go here but can anyone who actually goes here or has gone here please give me some clarity about life after your degree? Or even while in college. Did any of you get internships/jobs? 

&amp;#x200B;

This is a really big decision for me, I need all the advice I can get."

I am still on the hunt to do a literate fandom romance rp. Below are a few plot ideas, but I'm open to any you may have! (Note: These are Canon x OC, with you playing the canon role)

New Royal Crush (M x F or M x M)

Bowser x OC Bowser grew tired of chasing Princess Peach. He knew she didn't feel the same way he did. So he decided to pursue a new person...

This can be kidnapping, or maybe Bowser shows a sweet side. Up to you!

Not for Long (M x M)

Wallace Wells x OC (Scott Pilgrim Rp) When Scott brings over his new friend from work, Wallace outs on his usual moves. His best friend telling him the cute boy is straight won't stop him...

The Lab Intern (M x F or M x M) Professor Birch x OC (Pokemon) When Professor Birch was told he would get a new intern, he wasn't expecting someone so cute. As his feelings grow by the day, what will he do?

SHE/HE'S MINE! (M x F or M x M) BTR guys x OC (Big Time Rush) After a new up and coming artist moves into the Palm Woods, the guys go crazy for them (except for Kendall). Who will this new artist choose?

This is a love rivalry plot.

New to the Force (M x M) The Ginyu Force x OC (Dragon Ball Z) After Guildo left, the Ginyu force hired a new member- but weren't expecting someone so adorable and begin fighting over him. What will he do?

This is a love rivalry plot.

Game on, dude! (M x F or M x M) Bastion, Chumley and Hassleberry x OC (Yugioh GX) After a new student moved to Duel Academy, the guys couldn't resist them. Who will the newbie go for?

I will play pretty much all other characters in this, and it's a love rivalry.

Colors (M x M) Beast Boy x OC (Teen Titans) Beast Boy never thought he would love again. Until a cute boy joined their team... Wait, did he like guys? How will he deal with his feelings as they grow stronger?

Moving on (M x F or M x M) Tom x OC (Star vs the forces of evil After getting dumped by Star for Marco, Tom never thought he'd love again... Until someone new comes into his sights...

If none of these strike your fancy, feel free to give me your ideas/fandoms! Other fandoms I enjoy but don't have a specific plot for: Adventure Time, Avatar the last airbender, Disney, Inuyasha, Left 4 Dead, Legend of Korra, Total Drama

⭐⭐ Here are my rules:

1. Please be literate. No text talk or bad grammar (minus the occasional slip up of course).

2. I only rp in 3rd person. This is non-negotiable. Please be okay doing 3rd.

3. I ONLY PLAY UKE/SUB, NEVER DOM!!!! MY CHARACTERS ARE SUBS ONLY!!!! You have been warned!!!!

4. Be okay with OC x canon

5. Please be an active role player overall. We all have lives but please don't just disappear for days on end and never return.

6. If you are looking for all smut, you have come to the wrong place. I am fine with a build up to smut, but I want there to be a focus on romance and plot.

7. Please be respectful of me. I am a very friendly person but the quickest way to end an rp with me is to treat me badly. I am a human that deserves dignity like everyone else. Insult me once and it's over.

8. I'm sorry, but if your profile pic has a real person in it, I would ask that you change it before rping. It really just throws me off as weird as that sounds (anime/cartoon pics, scenery and anything else really are fine).

9. I usually do written bios, but if you HAVE to have pictures, I only do anime/cartoon refs and will only accept the same. NO REAL LIFE PICS PLEASE!!!

I am fine with people of all gender expressions, as long as you play M! My timezone is EST US time. All characters will be 18+. I am working most of today but I will reply as soon as possible.

I think that's it? If interested, kik:

Hope to rp soon!

I wasn't very social through high school and middle school and never experienced anything I was supposed to, let's just keep it at that. I got good grades, nothing spectacular beyond that though.

Now I'm in college for Engineering. Middle school and high school are the chillest parts of someone's life, low work load and no stress, most people just relaxed with friends and had a good time.

I missed out on that and now I'm in an extremely stressful major. For the next four years I'll have to study all the time, then a career, then I'll retire. Just a boring monotonous cycle of getting up, suffering, then lying down day after day, year after year. 

No more Summer's off, just internships and resume building, and later work. 

One thing I'm terrified of is being alone again, not even a study group to talk to. "
9bh0wg,0,2018-08-30,Mein berufsbegleitender Master demotiviert mich total,demotivatedasfuck,de,https://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/9bh0wg/mein_berufsbegleitender_master_demotiviert_mich/,"Hallo zusammen,

neuen Account, um mir ein wenig mal was von der Seele zu schreiben. Es geht um mein berufsbegleitendes Studium, was mich total demotiviert und mir jetzt mal wieder den ganzen Urlaub versaut hat und inzwischen für mich nur noch eine Belastung ist. Kurzer Hintergrund zu mir:  
Bin Anfang 30, habe vor knapp 7 Jahren meinen Bachelor of Engineering abgeschlossen und bin seitdem bei einem der größten Arbeitgeber Deutschlands angestellt. In der Vergangenheit hat mein Umfeld (Eltern, Familie) immer wieder zu einem Master gedrängt, da ein Bachelor ja ""wohl"" zu wenig wäre. Ich hatte aber keine große Lust und mein erstes berufsbegleitendes Studium zum Ingenieur war schon anstrengend genug. 

Beruflich läuft es ziemlich gut, auch wenn ich nicht so wirklich weiß, wo ich langfristig hin will. Nach 7 Jahren Zugehörigkeit im Unternehmen knacke ich nächstes Jahr die 90k fix, zusätzliche Vergütungen (Reisezeit, Überstunden) kommen noch oben drauf, sodass ich inklusive Leistungsbewertung bei sicherlich 100k im Jahr liege - und das trotz einer 35 Stundenwoche.

Habe zwischendurch innerhalb des Unternehmens an Programmen für potentielle Führungskräfte teilgenommen und mir einen guten Ruf erarbeitet. Inzwischen bin ich sowas wie ein Konfliktlöser für Prozesse. Ich unterstütze einen Großteil der Projekte bei der Abwicklung im Entwicklungsumfeld. Und hierbei nicht die technischen Aspekte, sondern die prozessuale Aussteuerung. Letztes Jahr bin ich dafür intern gewechselt und mein neuer Job ist echt top. Ich war zwischenzeitlich als kleiner Mediator in manchen Bereichen unterwegs, was mir enorme Freude bereitet hat und ich habe hier entsprechend gut performt und auch gutes Feedback bekommen. 

Leider zieht mich mein berufsbegleitendes Studium ein wenig runter. Die letzten Jahre wollte ich immer mal ins Consulting, allerdings auch hier auf Entwicklungsprozesse bezogen und weniger auf Geschäftsprozesse. Dafür habe ich mich auch im Unternehmen vernetzt und darüber meinen Mentor kennengelernt. Der hat mir dann letztendlich dann auch den Tip gegeben: Ohne Studium der Betriebswirtschaft wird es einfach nix mit der Beratung, daraufhin habe ich mich an einer Hochschule für einen MBA eingeschrieben. Das war 2017.

Generell finde ich die Idee nicht schlecht, auch betriebswirtschaftliche Prozesse zu verstehen, da ich auch immer im Kontakt mit dem Vertrieb bin. Könnte mir auch durchaus vorstellen im Vertrieb zu arbeiten, da ich gerade quasi Consulting schon mache und inzwischen weniger den Wunsch verspüre ins Consulting zu wechseln.

Zum Start des Studiums war ich noch hochmotiviert, doch inzwischen einfach nur noch pissed. Es ist einfach nur dummes, stumpfes Auswendiglernen. Es gibt kein Fach, bei dem ich irgendetwas verstehen muss, sondern entweder Gesetzestexte kennen und darauf verweisen oder einfach 100 Folien/500 Seiten lernen. Inzwischen lerne ich nur noch 1 - 2 Tage vorher, da mir die ganze Auswendiglernerei so auf den Sack geht. Bestehe trotzdem die Klausuren, manchmal sogar mit 1.x, ansonsten oft halt 2er Schnitte. In Hausarbeiten glänze ich in der Regel, da ich mir die Themen selber aussuche. Die interessieren mich in der Regel, sodass ich hier ein wenig mehr Zeit investiere. Am Ende schreibe ich aber alle Hausarbeiten innerhalb von 2 Tagen. Womit wir ein wenig bei meinem Problem sind: Ich kann langfristig mich einfach nicht ansatzweise mit Themen aus dem Studium beschäftigen.

Das kurzfristige Lernen klappt aber leider nicht bei allen Fächern. Schreibe Samstag Recht (1. Semester, 1. Versuch) und müsste eigentlich Gesetzestexte &amp; Klausuren büffeln, aber verspüre 0,0 Drang irgendetwas für das Fach zu machen. Und meine Motivation ist auch einfach inzwischen im Keller. 

Problem für mich ist einfach: Das Studium zieht mich total runter. Es hängt wie ein dumpfer Schleier über mir, dessen Sinn ich einfach nicht mehr sehe. Es versaut mir meinen Urlaub (hatte extra Urlaub zum Lernen für die Fächer genommen) und kostet obendrein noch eine Menge Geld. Am Ende habe ich im Urlaub nicht bzw. wenig gelernt, aber natürlich auch nicht großartig was anderes unternommen (weil ich ja hätte lernen müssen), sodass ich nur zu Hause am chillen war. Das nervt mich gerade tierisch und kotzt mich an. Ich würde gerne einfach mal 100% abschalten, aber kann das wegen des Studiums nicht mehr. 

Inzwischen überlege ich, ob ich den scheiss nicht einfach sein lasse. Ich habe natürlich den Fehler gemacht, dass mein ganzes Umfeld weiß, dass ich studiere. Während meine Freundin mich 100% unterstützt, kann ich jetzt schon die Sprüche meiner Eltern hören, die mich ja immer zu einem Master gedrängt haben. Auf der Arbeit weiß mein Chef und ein paar Kollegen Bescheid. Das Studium nicht zu schaffen/aufgeben, wäre jetzt nicht schlimm, aber wäre schon ein kleiner Knick in meinem Lebenslauf.

Was würdet ihr machen? Mal hinsetzen und lernen? 

Werde aufjedenfall die aktuelle Klausurphase mitnehmen, auch wenn ich da nicht sonderlich viel Lust drauf habe. Aber bisher hat das kurzfristige Lernen ja eigentlich immer ganz gut geklappt. "

Before I start I want apologize to anyone who reads this since this is pretty much just teenage angst at its finest and in no way compares to some of the more important things going on in the world or even in others daily lives and maybe this post doesnt belong here, but it's just something I needed to write down.

SIDE NOTE: After writing this all out I realize it is an extremely long story (4 pages on Word, 3025 words), one I definetly had to get off my chest to SOMEONE. This text is super immature, I still have a lot of things to work on and develop, sorry to anyone out there who reads this dumb teenage story. I just wanted to share some of the things I didn’t even share with my closest friend because they were my memories to keep, but it’s mostly just some stupid teenage love(?) story that is partly just me rambling about my experience with this cute girl I fell for. You don’t have to read the whole thing but theres some context (maybe too much) that I needed to give to explain why its going to be so hard to move on.  Thanks to anyone who took time out of their day to read any part of this post, it doesn’t deserve it, but it means a lot to me. 

Thanks you internet strangers.


To start off I want to explain my own self-image. I've never exactly considered myself good looking, I'm cute (I think?), and I've struggled with my body weight for a while and having acne didnt help my self-esteem, so I've never been good with girls even though I do think I can talk and crack jokes pretty well, I'm smooth what can I say. So finding someone who was interested in me was... a new experience, and it was an amazing one.

When school started last year I wasnt excited. I live down in Florida and classes are split up into two days of periods 1, 3, 5 on one day and 2, 4, 6 on the other. Period 1 changed everything for me as I got placed next to a cute girl (We'll call her Billie but for now shes just that cute girl). I was nervous cause haha a cute girl or whatever but I kept my cool, I wasnt focused on girls at the time as I wasnt confident in myself. In September I decided to change and started doing lots of cardio and improving my diet. My body got to a point where I was a lot more comfortable and my face even began clearing up a bit. I became a lot more confident.

 The cute girl became an acquaintance as we had the same period 3 and we were taking the same classes but in different periods and we bonded over stupid stuff. At first I knew I was catching feelings but I dismissed them as just falling for the first girl who was nice to me. December came and with it holiday break. I lost interest and I thought rightly so as I didnt see it becoming anything. When school returned everything was the same and nothing changed. Spring break eventually came at the end of March and by this point my feelings were even stronger than before. All throughout spring break I thought of her. It was then that I first openly admitted to my best friend that I had a crush (I felt like some little kid admitting that). Now for anyone who doesnt know about standardized testing in the US spring break occurs usually right before our testing begins (atleast here in Florida) so when it ended I expected a rough last couple months of junior year. I was wrong, they were probably the happiest I'd been in... forever. I’d give anything to go back now.

That cute girl in period one and I bonded over even more dumb stuff. With the struggles of testing, we talked about how we wanted to die (not in the literal sense), teased one another, and joked about dropping out. Even though it had been months since we were friends I  finally got her Snapchat (woah Im in boys) and one day out of the blue on 4/19 (I remember because it was before 4/20 haha weed) and I saw what she was like outside of school. I also remember Infinity War had just come out and she posted on her private story asking who was down to go. It was the most outgoing thing I think I've ever done, but I messaged her saying I was down. I thought it would be a group thing but it was just gonna be us two, until her friend invited herself and it was three of us instead (darn). After the movie we went to McDonalds and bonded over a stupid McChicken. We texted a lot from this point on. May rolled around and with it came AP tests (tests for college classes) and we bonded over that too, same thing ""ugh i wanna die"" and all that. I had talked to her about making a study group for one of our classes, purely as an excuse to spend time with her, and we set it up at a nearby library just her me one of her friends (Churro just to name her) and her best friend (Scorpio we’ll name her). We didn’t study much at the library as we sucked at teaching each other so we went to Billie’s house and hung out there, it was cool just spending time with friends like that. In that moment we were just friends and I was okay with that, I just wanted her in my life. I still do.

Anyways, AP testing usually takes two weeks to go through all tests, we finished ours the first week because it was just scheduled that way and that Friday I asked if she wanted to hang out and watch a movie. She said yeah! I was so happy at the time it was just gonna be me and her watching a movie at her house! It didnt end up that way, weirdly enough I think it ended better. She had plans to go ice skating with some friends and she dodged them. For me. No one does that for me. Regardless, Scorpio called her and still wanted to hang out and I could tell Billie was annoyed by it so we ended up all going to the mall. I got to get to know Scorpio a lot better and she was super cool and chill. Eventually Scorpio's cousin and her friend were nearby and joined us, I didnt know them and Billie only kind of knew them so we walked. Just me and her we walked and talked around the mall. It was great, just being next to her, messing around. It was great.

That day ended and the weekend began. Mother’s day came and it was a boring day for me, I had lunch with my mom but she preferred to spend the day with her girlfriend then her two sons, but it was okay because Billie texted me. She had gone to a hotel near the beach and told me about her day. She talked about this guy she had met while she was in the hot tub and how they had started texting. At that point, my feelings were crushed, I had lost my chance. She asked me what she should do and I told her to go for it! What choice did I have? I didn’t see myself as anything more than a friend to her. Later that night, we FaceTimed for the first time and we talked for hours about the smallest of things and she took this really cringey and funny picture of me in a stupid hat, it still makes me smile, and it was just great. She never mentioned that guy again, I couldn’t take the hint then cause Im an idiot. I’d change that if I could.

The week started again on Monday and we talked and FaceTimed throughout that week. The weekend came around again and I had plans on Saturday but my friends cancelled on me and it sucked. I opened snapchat and saw that she said she said she was bored on her story. I messaged her and asked if she wanted to go see ""A Quiet Place"" not because either of us liked the movie but because of Jim from the Office (thanks John Krasinski and the Office for bonding teenagers across America if not the world). Just me and her. The movie was at 8 but we went to the mall at 5 and just walked around. It was so... amazing, words cant really describe how I felt in that moment or how it even was to be there. Heres the best way I can explain it. Time stood still and everything around us faded into the background and nothing else mattered, it was just us two, sitting there in the mall laughing like two idiots. That day will always be a warm memory to me. We went to McDonalds at the end and bonded over a McChicken cause were just two broke teenagers and laughed over dumb jokes. She drove me home and we hugged for the first time (it was a stupid small hug but it made my heart jump) and afterwards we texted all night. If I could go back to any day I’d go to that one and punch myself for not making a move right then and there.

Another school week passed of talking, texting, and FaceTiming, and we made plans that Friday to go to see Deadpool. It was gonna be her and Scorpio and me and my two closest friends (lets call them Castro and Alex). Friday came and we headed to the mall to go see the movie. Scorpio lives near me so Billie picked us both up. Alex lived farther away so he ubered and met us there. Unfortunately, Castro took a nap afterschool and didnt make it (weird how fate(?) works i guess since he’s now dating Scorpio, courtesy of yours truly and I’m really happy for them, I love seeing them both happy). We saw the movie through some annoyances since Alex was 16 and we had to sneak him into the theater (is that a crime idk if I can admit that here whoops). The day was fun and we went home Billie driving Scorpio and me home. We texted throughout that weekend and on Sunday we both had separate plans but I remember that night she sent me the cutest picture anyone has ever sent me, it was cringey and dumb for sure and words cant really describe it. It is by far my favorite picture. Ever. Trust me I fell in love with that girl right then and there.

We would FaceTime one last time that Monday as clueless friends.  The next day, Tuesday afterschool we texted some more and that conversation was the cutest thing ever. I hinted to my feelings for her and she hinted to her feelings for me and neither of us wanted to make a move for fear of rejection from the other. Nothing would have happened if Scorpio wouldn’t have texted me telling me to “MAKE A MOVE”, my heart nearly exploded at that. The next day, Wednesday, she drove me home and I asked her out. She said yes. We finally admitted all of our feelings for each other. In that moment everything changed and my summer began.

It was the best summer of my life (so far I don’t really wanna peak now). We set our first date to be a picnic at a nearby park on Saturday. Before then on Friday we went bowling with Scorpio and this other guy, it was fun she gave me a lot of her attention which was just so nice. Leading up to the picnic I had bought her favorite foods from Oreos to pineapple on pizza (weird I know but I tried it and its okay). I took a Bluetooth speaker and an old tablecloth that I set down under a tree and we talked. I won’t lie, it was far from perfect. A lot of the food went uneaten as unfortunately she had gotten her period that exact day (a little funny) and she didn’t want to cancel on me. I thought that was cute. We were there for maybe two hours and a half and nothing really happened so we went to Scorpios house and gave her some food, hung out there, and she dropped me off at my house afterwards. I was left feeling disappointed at how the day had went but not five minutes had passed when she called me and said “I hope you know were doing that again“ and my heart just melted. I couldn’t believe someone so amazing wanted to have a second time with me. Of all people. Me.

We texted constantly the last week of school. We weren’t official so we didn’t show any couple stuff that last week. The last day came and went and unfortunately, I was heading to the airport at 7:30 on a visit to a cousin in DC. She was hanging out with friends at Scorpios house which is again a two minute drive from mine, and she texted me saying she wished I was there. I told her she could always come by, but she said she couldn’t. So I went, I begged my brother to let me borrow his car and drive over there and he let me. I picked her up and we drove to a nearby park (different from the picnic park) and we kissed. Bit of a side note, but this was both of our first relationships so we had no idea what we were doing. It was bad and it was super awkward, but memorable. I still cant believe she was my first and being someone else’s first is cool too. I went to Washington and came back and we saw each other again on Thursday and we became official. I wouldn’t see her for about two weeks because she had to go on a cruise, which really sucked. She came back on a Saturday and she came to see me on a Sunday and it was great spending time with her. It was great because I never imagined that cute girl in period one to be in my room and to be able to call her mine.

We would both be starting internships for school at the same company, spending 5 weeks together as coworkers. Those five weeks would’ve been hell on Earth if it hadn’t been for her. We would just mess around somedays and it was an amazing experience. The rest of the summer is just so hard to describe. I learned how to ice-skate somewhat, she taught me how. I made new friends in her friends. I learned what if feels like when some other guy hits on your girlfriend, it pissed me off.  I learned how funny it is when guys DM your girlfriend and she blows them off because she wants you. We spent so much time together. Yet I took it all for granted. I couldn’t just accept that I was happy. She wasn’t the affectionate type and I couldn’t seem to be okay with that. I wouldn’t force anything too big just sometimes I’d hold her close and she would push me away. She tried changing for me I really know she tried but I pushed way too hard and I messed it up. I shouldn’t have done that. I’d yell and scream and punch myself and take it all back if I could. Why did I have to mess it up? Why couldn’t I just be happy?

Now that schools started again, we broke up. The first week was awkward as we didn’t know how to act as a couple. We talked about it and I didn’t express my feelings well. She avoided texting me this past weekend and told me it wasn’t because she was upset at me, but rather at everything else. She wouldn’t tell me what and I didn’t wanna push it so I gave her some space. I could feel it coming and I did ask her if she wanted to end it, she said no and I thought things would get better from there, didn’t turn out that way. This past Tuesday we ended it over text, which was my fault as I don’t think I could have faced her. She told me she had some family and mental issues she had to figure out on her own and she couldn’t really focus on working on our relationship right now. It sucks because I understand that decision, it’s a really mature one to take, and I’ll support her fully because I love her, but I’m somehow not okay with it. I didn’t want it to end. I still don’t. Does that make me a selfish person? I’m not a good one that’s for sure, but I really wanted to make it work. What makes it so much harder is that she left it so open, as if maybe when shes ready there’ll be a chance and we can be together and work on it again because for a long time there it was really good. It was really good and I wish I could go back and do it all over again and fix my mistakes and just yell at myself.
 
I know I’ll heal and learn a lot from this amazing experience I got to have, but that takes time and I don’t know what the future holds for me, and for a while I was excited for my future, but now as an angsty seventeen year old guy whose plans got all messed up, I’m scared.

9bijpi,58,2018-08-30,No personal space,Clandestine25,introvert,https://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/comments/9bijpi/no_personal_space/,"Hey guys, I guess it's just venting, so ignore it if you think I'm whining. 

I've recently realised that in my 23 years on this planet I only had some privacy and personal space for 6 months, when I did an internship abroad and had enough money to rent my own room.

I used to have a room for myself as a kid, but my parents and sister never respected my privacy. They could just walk in without knocking, rearrange all my stuff, borrow or throw away something etc. My mom loved having long conversations when I was trying to study for school or practice guitar, and my little sister just smashed things when she felt like it. They also never let me decorate my room and often replaced or repainted things without my knowledge (I still shudder thinking of those pink curtains).

When I was 16 we moved and from then on all 4 of us mostly lived and slept in the same room. I hated it so much I went to university in another city just to live away from them. I shared my dorm room with different people for three years, and though it was better than living with my folks, I still couldn't do many things I wanted to do, like playing music (I'm really shy and can't practice with other people around).

After college I had a serious injury, hit rock bottom financially, and had to move back with my family. 

Now we all live in the same room again and I'm literally NEVER alone. I work full-time in an open office and spend three hours a day in public transport commute just to come home and have no space to myself at all again. I gave up music completely.  The only escape is headphones + staring at the screen, but then my family says I'm a couch potato and accuses me of ignoring them when they talk to me.

Ideally I need to hold on  for at least one more year to save up for independent living &amp; my healthcare expenses but sometimes I feel like screwing all my long-term plans and health just to have a quiet corner somewhere. 

I also feel like this whole situation has affected me negatively as a person. I feel stupid because I can never just think about something quietly or practice some new skill without being interrupted continuously. I don't really socialize with people because I don't want to admit I live with my parents. Basically I just try to stuff my head with some crap like TV or social media to distract myself from the whole situation, and I can't even unwind and consider how to make it all better.

Sorry for the long post."

I've been working in the IT industry for years, but really only ended up there because I was good at it, I've never enjoyed it. I worked my way up solely through experience, I've done help desk work (despised it), hands-on work such as repairing laptops and desktops (enjoyable but not something I can do for the rest of my life).

In high school, I had a small YouTube channel with a bunch of my friends. I was the designated camera operator and editor. Our equipment was pretty bad, we had one of those crappy Flip cameras, and I used Cyberlink PowerDirector to edit (this was around 2009/2010). The edits were pretty simple, I messed around with some chroma key effects and became very comfortable with that editing software. 

Anyway, I've always wanted to work in either audio production/recording, or video production. I'm currently living in Pittsburgh, and I've been on-track to attend Pittsburgh Technical College for their ""multimedia technologies"" program. [This is the curriculum list.](https://imgur.com/a/VrhFYEd) It's pretty comprehensive, and includes an internship at the end of the program. 

I've talked to a few people who are already in the industry, some say that a degree in this field is just a piece of paper that costs tens of thousands of dollars. Others say it would be worth going through with. With my technical background and some experience in video production, could I break into the industry by just learning the programs and methods myself? I'm a hands-on learner, and have never done well in a classroom environment.

Any advice is appreciated, thanks!"
9bjyvb,317,2018-08-30,A new approach to Tesla/Musk/Electric Vehicle threads,brandonsmash,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/9bjyvb/a_new_approach_to_teslamuskelectric_vehicle/,"**(TL;dr: Tesla-related submissions and comments are going to be subject to increased scrutiny.)**


Stick with me here, this is going to get a bit ""Pepperidge Farm remembers"" for a minute.

In 1861 the American Civil War began. The First Battle of Bull Run -- the inaugural conflict of the war -- took place in Manassas, Virginia, on the Yorkshire Plantation owned by Wilmer McLean. 

The battle shook Wilmer and his family and they moved from their plantation to escape being further embroiled in the war; in 1863, the McLean family moved to a remote area some 120 miles away. 


In 1865 after a bloody struggle that cleaved the nation and forever altered its genetic and political legacy, Robert E. Lee was prepared surrender to Ulysses S. Grant. Over the past four years the war had seen action all across what was then United States territory and ended in Appomattox, Virginia.


A messenger was dispatched from Appomattox Courthouse to find a suitable location for the signing of the treaty that would end the war. The messenger imposed upon the first house he saw and begged the owner to host the historic meeting.


This house, by pure coincidence, was owned and occupied by one Wilmer McLean and family. He reluctantly agreed to host the signing and is quoted as having said, ""The war began in my front yard and ended in my front parlor.""

After the signing, many of the people present essentially ransacked McLean's house and gave him small change for the furniture which was now ""historic"" because it had been in the parlor for the surrender of the Confederacy. 

As the conversation regarding Tesla in particular and electric vehicles in general becomes more pitched, we're finding that **r/cars is becoming the Yorkshire Plantation of this particular engagement and the regular users here are feeling more and more like Wilmer McLean.** There are a number of bad actors on both sides of the electric vehicle argument and we've found ourselves regularly brigaded by members of both parties. 


On one hand we have anti-EV people who wish only for Tesla to fail and post articles (founded or not) that lambast Tesla and Elon Musk and anything to do with EVs, and on the other we have pro-Tesla folks (including an obstinate contingent of TSLA's own social media interns -- yes, we see you) who do all they can to spin the Tesla talk to positive.


This sort of William Randolph Hearst-esque **yellow journalism in which the headlines make the news is not acceptable here.** As one of the largest online automotive enthusiast forums operative (astonishingly, we're on track to hit 1,000,000 users by the end of the year) we have an obligation to keep our headlines fair and neutral, without giving preference to either contingent. 

Therefore, we've begun implementing some actions to minimize the effects of those acting in bad faith. **Going forward we'll be preemptively removing all EV submissions (and releasing them pending approval)** and taking a stronger stance against those who spam agenda-based posts. We will continue to monitor threads and will, as always, remove comments that are uncivil or encourage uncivil behavior (this means trolling and baiting, for instance). We will more aggressively monitor submissions for newsworthiness; one criterion will be, simply, ""Would this be newsworthy if it were about any other manufacturer?"" 

We will work to make sure that one voice does not dominate the discussion.


In short, we will not allow the Tesla War to be fought in our yard and follow us to our parlor. **This is not the place to promote your agenda;** our users have overwhelmingly indicated that, by and large, they don't want to see r/cars dominated by Tesla/EV/Musk headlines. r/teslamotors and r/realtesla exist and should be used. This isn't to say that we'll not allow any Tesla submissions: If an article passes the sniff test and is actually news, it is a valuable contribution to the subreddit and should be posted. However, we won't allow headlines to write the news and we want to make sure that we continue to have the best automotive community on the Internet.

So, as Abraham Lincoln said at the conclusion of the Civil War: [""Be excellent to each other and party on, dudes!""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S67sDHdhpio)

I do also have some programming experience with Python and Matlab (comp sci minor in college). I'm trying to get a job working with clinical data like clinical data coordinator, etc. I've been mostly applying online at the hospitals around the Boston area (MGH, Boston Children's, etc.) and I recently interviewed for a position at Dana-Farber. The position title is ""Research Data Specialist"" but during the interview, I found out that basically a majority of the responsibilities is just manual data entry of various aspects of patients' medical information and is quite removed from the clinical side. On the positive side, I will be learning a lot of clinical terminology and about cancer diagnoses. They're asking me for an in-person interview next, so I was wondering if this job is worth the hassle of traveling out of state for the interview.

I miss feeling those strong feelings, those intense feelings that make you feel alive. 

I've been drowning myself in work - signing myself up for courses that are challenging, taking up internships... all these so that I can regain my own sense of worth. 

Recently I found out a close relative of mine only have 2 weeks left to live. I feel so sad and so jaded from everything. I just wish I could have someone to talk to, and someone who can just cuddle with me. I went onto dating apps, hoping to just find that someone, but I'm scared of meeting people I know, because people talk and I'm afraid of being judged.

Dear Texas A&amp;M-Corpus Christi students,  


This message is just for you, my fellow Islanders. That’s right. I’m an Islander! Forever! Class of 2003!  


A few weeks ago I dropped my oldest off at Texas A&amp;M-College Station and, as parents typically do during that emotional weekend, I began reflecting on my own time in college. Driving to class along beautiful Ocean Drive. The sun and wind on my face as I walked between classes. Great friends, many of whom work on local projects with me to this day. Great professors, many I now call my friends. Watching a college grow into a university. Watching a small island in my community transform into a vital ingredient of my community.  


Corpus Christi is a beautiful, vibrant city and I hope that you take full advantage of it while you’re here. Walk the Bayfront often. Take up surfing or paddleboarding. Learn the growing local music scene. Make friends with someone that has a boat! Drop in on the good vibes at the farmers’ market downtown on Wednesdays. We’ve got things to do here you can’t do anywhere else in Texas.  


You’ve picked a great place to receive your college education and whether you grew up here or are visiting for a short time, welcome home.

That’s right. ‘Welcome home.’ I believe that while you’re here in Corpus Christi, it IS your home. Welcome to #islandtime.

I’m running for mayor for Corpus Christi and one of my goals is that, when I leave office, you will graduate in a city that you don’t want to leave. That job opportunities are everywhere. That exciting, new industry is building new businesses. That many more existing businesses have internship programs with paths to a job. That the outdoor lifestyle you want to live is easier to access and filled with 21st century things to do. Things that you see in cities when you travel. That your city is cleaner and friendlier and that we all care about it so much that we would never do anything to harm it. It’s our home after all. We are proud of it.

You see, your new home is at a crossroads. We haven’t done a great job meeting your specific needs and we’ve created a bit of a reputation as a city where younger folks can’t find what they desire.

As your mayor, I will change that. As a community servant, I have already done more in 6 years to support your desires than our current mayor has done in 30 plus!  


I will be a vital voice for everyone, but since I’m just talking to you right now, I want to be clear: I will put more attention on you and people your age than past city leaders have in this community. I believe that it’s long overdue and that the future of our city depends on it. A smart, healthy community is vital. Relevant. We’re the eighth largest city in Texas. Why does every other large city in Texas get it while we sit on this jewel of a coast and waste it? As if we don’t deserve a relatively equal quality of life and our community members don’t deserve it?

With four kids that are a little younger than you, I know that people your age are connected to the world in a way older generations don’t understand. I know that you pay attention to how your city leaders address important things you want like exciting, competitive job opportunities. But I also know that you believe that where you live is just as important to you as where you work. If potential new businesses pay attention to these things, why don’t our leaders?

Dear Texas A&amp;M-Corpus Christi students,

This message is just for you, my fellow Islanders. That’s right. I’m an Islander! Forever! Class of 2003!

A few weeks ago I dropped my oldest off at Texas A&amp;M-College Station and, as parents typically do during that emotional weekend, I began reflecting on my own time in college. Driving to class along beautiful Ocean Drive. The sun and wind on my face as I walked between classes. Great friends, many of whom work on local projects with me to this day. Great professors, many I now call my friends. Watching a college grow into a university. Watching a small island in my community transform into a vital ingredient of my community.

Corpus Christi is a beautiful, vibrant city and I hope that you take full advantage of it while you’re here. Walk the Bayfront often. Take up surfing or paddleboarding. Learn the growing local music scene. Make friends with someone that has a boat! Drop in on the good vibes at the farmers’ market downtown on Wednesdays. We’ve got things to do here you can’t do anywhere else in Texas.

You’ve picked a great place to receive your college education and whether you grew up here or are visiting for a short time, welcome home.

That’s right. ‘Welcome home.’ I believe that while you’re here in Corpus Christi, it IS your home. Welcome to #islandtime.

I’m running for mayor for Corpus Christi and one of my goals is that, when I leave office, you will graduate in a city that you don’t want to leave. That job opportunities are everywhere. That exciting, new industry is building new businesses. That many more existing businesses have internship programs with paths to a job. That the outdoor lifestyle you want to live is easier to access and filled with 21st century things to do. Things that you see in cities when you travel. That your city is cleaner and friendlier and that we all care about it so much that we would never do anything to harm it. It’s our home after all. We are proud of it.

You see, your new home is at a crossroads. We haven’t done a great job meeting your specific needs and we’ve created a bit of a reputation as a city where younger folks can’t find what they desire.

As your mayor, I will change that. As a community servant, I have already done more in 6 years to support your desires than our current mayor has done in 30 plus!

I will be a vital voice for everyone, but since I’m just talking to you right now, I want to be clear: I will put more attention on you and people your age than past city leaders have in this community. I believe that it’s long overdue and that the future of our city depends on it. A smart, healthy community is vital. Relevant. We’re the eighth largest city in Texas. Why does every other large city in Texas get it while we sit on this jewel of a coast and waste it? As if we don’t deserve a relatively equal quality of life and our community members don’t deserve it?

With four kids that are a little younger than you, I know that people your age are connected to the world in a way older generations don’t understand. I know that you pay attention to how your city leaders address important things you want like exciting, competitive job opportunities. But I also know that you believe that where you live is just as important to you as where you work. If potential new businesses pay attention to these things, why don’t our leaders? It doesn’t matter; I do pay attention to them.

Whether this is your new home or you have been here your entire life, I hope you’ll get involved while you’re here. We need your ideas, passion and energy. We need young leadership. We need strong, young, vital leaders to share their voices.

Will you do me a favor and [look at this page](http://electaislynn.com/imagine-if-everyone-in-corpus-christi-voted/) where I talk about the importance of EVERYONE in Corpus Christi voting this election?

I've already accepted a full time offer after having 2 internships and 2 exams.

​

My question right now is how important is my computer science minor? I've been personally struggling with my computer science classes (Java and C++) and I just can't quite pick it up as easily as I do actuarial science. I got the minor to begin with because I knew it would be valuable.

​

If I act soon, I can still be a finance and actuarial science double major. I wouldn't have nearly as much trouble and I could spend more time studying for another exam. I spent time programming in SQL during the summer without a problem.

​

Is object-oriented used on the job? Is it worth having the minors when I already have a job? Any advice is greatly appreciated.

9bm9g2,8,2018-08-30,"""WHY THE FAT-BURNING OBSESSION IN KETO DIETS IS DANGEROUS"" -Courtney Ferreira, Registered Dietitian",HotDogen,keto,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/9bm9g2/why_the_fatburning_obsession_in_keto_diets_is/,"Always in search of confounding variables that might go against the vast volumes of science that proves that Keto is not only an effective and healthy way to lose weight, I often do Google searches for phrases like ""Why The Keto Diet Is Dangerous.""  Unfailingly, I find [articles like these](https://wellseek.co/2018/07/15/fat-burning-obsession-keto-diets-dangerous/) that have click-bait titles and absolutely no substance, or worse still, are full of misinformation.  

So I came across this gem written by one ""Courtney Ferreira, MS, RD, LDN"".  (She's from Baltimore, so I'm surprised she didn't throw an ""MD"" on there out of technicality.)  Courtney is a ""registered dietitican"" which in the state of Maryland means she at least has a bachelor's degree (though her signature would indicate a Master's) and spent at least 1200 hours (8 months) doing an internship to get the license.  Now, you may think I sound a bit biased against ""registered dieticians,"" and you'd be right.  I've *literally never met one* that actually understood how the human body works.  Worse still, my grandmother, whom I loved dearly, was also a registered dietician.  She died of heart disease at the age of 56.  

Now, I would be more willing to cut the author some slack, because the *entirety* of her article isn't wrong, but with that click-bait title, and knowing that the vast majority of people never read past the title, she's already started off with gross misinformation that I'll now have to fight every time a family member comes across such an article.  

But what would she have to gain by writing an article full of misinformation?  Hrm.  According to her website she sells ""services"" such as speaking engagements, and counseling on how to diet.  *I can't imagine why she would dislike a diet that's so simple to follow, and so effective, and so healthy that it makes ""registered dieticians"" utterly unneccessary.*

So she starts from the position that the Keto diet is a ""medical"" diet and people only use it now because it's a ""fad"".  Then has the gall to say, ""Let's take an ***unbiased*** look at what ketsosis actually is...""  Unbiased, huh?

She goes on to describe at the 10,000 foot level what ketosis is, skips the part about fats being converted to glucose, and what a ""ketone"" actually is, and makes it sound like the body just turns fat into straight ketones, and starts using ketones for energy.  -1 for clarity.

She does follow that up by saying, ""It is important to note here, that this nutritional ketosis is *different* from ketoacidosis"" (emphasis hers).  So +1 for accuracy.  

But then she states (under the MEDICAL reasons people would do the diet), 

&gt; ""as a nutrition professional who has worked in pediatrics and seen children who must follow this diet, it is incredibly challenging for both the child and family""

Well, as a regular ole' Joe Blow, I don't find it even remotely challenging.  Nor does my wife.  Or anyone else I know on the diet.   Maybe your clients find it ""incredibly challenging"" because you're telling them how to do it wrong?  

And she goes on to actually sing the praises of a ""low-carbohydrate diet"" though not necessarily Keto.

Then, to further illustrate how completely and utterly unbiased she is, she continues: 

&gt; Unfortunately, as with other fad diets, the context of its benefits are mishandled as they reach the wellness world.  

Well, sure, anyone can ""mishandle"" a diet, but I don't see you writing an article about what happens if you do Weight Watchers by only consuming your point value in oatmeal, either.  

And this is where she drops the *entirety of her argument*.  She ***literally*** has had nothing bad to say about the Keto diet until she gets to this point in her write-up.  And here it is:  

***If you continue to do hard-core keto once you've lost all your body fat, it's bad, mmmmkay?***  

That's it.  It's literally the entirety of her objection to Keto.  Even the medical articles she links throughout her write-up sing the praises of Keto.  

But yet, here's her reason for stating that ""Keto Diets [are] Dangerous"".  

&gt; ""This notion of ‘burning’ as much fat off our bodies as we can can be downright dangerous because biologically, we need fat. Having too little body fat can lead to issues""

So shouldn't her title have read, ""Why Burning Too Much Fat When You're Thin Is Dangerous""?  

But that's not clickbaity enough, and that doesn't get people to thinking they should avoid the diet that makes her job obsolete..."
9bmc44,1,2018-08-30,Having trouble finding both work and housing for an out-of-state move. Suggestions?,kingbleach13,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9bmc44/having_trouble_finding_both_work_and_housing_for/,"Three friends and I have been planning a move from upstate New York to Raleigh, North Carolina for about six months; we've each saved up money in every way possible, made sure our credit scores are good (we're all above 720), and have taken care of our student loans. We're aiming for a move-in date in early or mid October, but for the life of us we can't find any suitable housing. We're all 23 and recent college graduates.

​

As far as renting houses go, every option that has four bedrooms seems to be in an income-controlled neighborhood, or has requirements that rule us out (i.e. no more than two unrelated adults, only two people's income can qualify for financial eligibility versus all four's, etc.).

​

Regarding apartments, we're having a slightly less but still difficult time. Two of us (including myself) are applying for jobs relevant to our degree work and still haven't received any promising leads; the other two are transferring from their respective jobs at Red Lobster and Texas Roadhouse to branches in the Raleigh area. None of us have any income being made in North Carolina, which rules us out of most apartment listings that have four bedrooms, despite the fact that we all have excellent credit history, degrees, and qualifying income in New York. Still, the actual jobs that will hopefully be on the table soon for the two in the restaurant industry don't earn enough without my other friend and I making money to meet the income requirements.

​

My one friend and I who are seeking new jobs are confused about our lack of progress; his degree is in engineering, he has work experience in various car shops, and was a main engineer for two major companies in our area right out of college. My degree work was in political science and history, which isn't necessarily lucrative; still, I have paralegal internship experience in D.C., and a 3.68 GPA, both of which I would hope make me a somewhat qualified candidate for administrative, office, collegiate, and paralegal positions. We're concerned that our lack of an actual NC address makes us less attractive candidates, but it doesn't appear that we can secure a place to list in Raleigh until we land the job, kind of a vicious circle situation. I do have three years of bartending and waiting experience myself which I can always break out to find a job if necessary, but I don't think I could realistically apply to those kinds of jobs down there so far in advance and so remotely.

​

If anyone has experience with these types of moves, or any relevant insight, I would appreciate it. We're closing in on our moving window, my seasonal job ends in two weeks, and I would like to resolve either the housing or job situation as soon as possible. Thanks!

I’ve noticed a recurring theme of veterans being anywhere from annoyed to frustrated to outright angry that their PCP is graduating/moving away (sometimes insisting on blaming the VA/funding/the government). In a lot of ways I get this; we deal with a lot of sensitive topics and psychosocial barriers, plus telling a life story in a “new PCP” appointment repetitively has to be annoying. 

Our attendings don’t often see the resident patients face-to-face beyond the first half of our intern year unless there’s something strange or serious, which means most patients don’t know their more consistent supervising attending, and the resident role as gatekeeper to VA services (and thus the face of the VA) I’m sure both contribute. 

Any suggestions for how to respond there patient concerns? Is this universal in civilian medicine too?"

I'm 24, going on 25 in a few months. I have my B.A. in English already, and even did a stint as a high school ELA teacher (1 year). 

Now, I find myself returning to school, living home with my parents, and feeling a lot older than my fellow undergrads lol.

I'm scared. I know I am making the right descision, but the time commitment, and the fact that I will probably have to be in school for several more years, scares the shit out of me. 

I want to be a doctor, and I have to basically start all over. Retaking pre-calculus, and starting with Chem 1 and Chem lab. Since I am going part time so I can continue to work and keep my hospital internship, I am looking at 2-3 years before I can take my MCAT, possibly even 4 years. 

I know I'm not the only one out there who has gone this route in life, but I figured I'd post here to introduce myself and see if anyone can relate. 

I have a long road ahead of me, and it is so hard when some of my friends have really nice jobs, their own places, etc. and all with only a B.A. I feel like I'm being left behind, even though I was in their position not that long ago when I opted out of renewing my teaching contract. 

So yeah, lol. That's me. At least this time college will be about studying and getting somewhere, instead of my social life (not that I slacked off in getting my English degree, I was still an honors student, but this time I feel like I actually have a direction and a goal. Teaching was my backup, law school was my 1st option that I decided not to pursue after careful consideration). 

I'm not looking for pity, I made my choices and now I'm making moves to get my life on track. Just looking for other people in the same/similar situation as me, and to hear their stories.

9bo41g,5,2018-08-30,Bimodal Sleep: Introduction | EXPERIMENT,canigetuhhhhhhhhhh,sleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/9bo41g/bimodal_sleep_introduction_experiment/,"This post prefaces why I'm doing this experiment, my background with sleep, the terminology I'll be using, and other introductory details. Excited to start documenting this in detail &amp; sharing!

## What *is* bimodal sleep? (*a.k.a.* segmented, biphasic, pre-industrial)

It's just sleeping from dusk til dawn—*but*, divided into two segments, with a period of relaxed awakeness in the middle during which pre-industrial folk used to chat, read, fuck, journal, walk outside, etc. This was before artificial light and the modern world's late-night entertainment expectations. If you're on this sub you've probably heard of this; if not, **these articles explain it well:**  
- New York Times Magazine, [""Letter of Recommendation: Segmented Sleep""](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/03/magazine/letter-of-recommendation-segmented-sleep.html)
- BBC News, [""The myth of the eight-hour sleep""](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-16964783)
- A blog, [""Biphasic Sleep: What Two Weeks Of It Did To Me""](http://renaissancehumans.com/what-two-weeks-of-biphasic-sleep-did-to-me-polyphasic-sleep/)

*To clarify: I'm not talking about the [siesta sleep pattern](https://www.polyphasicsociety.com/polyphasic-sleep/overviews/siesta/). I won't be napping, at all.  
Also, the name ""bimodal"" is kind of arbitrary—different articles use different names such as segmented or biphasic to refer to this same thing. I enjoy the sound of ""bimodal"" on my tongue.*

## Why am I doing this?

### I want to wake up ready to tackle the world—every day.

I'm in pursuit of the ""perfect night of sleep"". Something's been holding me back for years in terms of taking this on earnestly, but now I'm finally in the right situation for consistent self-experimentation. Not only has my emotional state been on the upswing, my meditation practice getting more stable, and my overall life quality improving, I'm *also* currently working at a meditation center in the middle of the woods as a ""working guest""—so I'm surrounded by big-hearted people all trying to improve their own and others' lives. :) Which is supportive of everything. And, there's nearly nothing to do or worry about around these parts once the sun sets, so I don't get FOMO by going to bed earlier.

**What *is* ""a perfect night of sleep""?** It's happened to me infrequently over the years of my short life (I'm college-age now). Every couple months it seems, I'll wake up refreshed and *completely energized*, without even the thought in my head that maybe I should go back to sleep—*springing* out of bed because I'm ready for the day. I feel great for the entire day and have an exuberantly positive, aware outlook on life &amp; what's in front of me. I'm motivated.  
I want to reproduce this feeling and awareness. This sleep experiment isn't about finding a productivity hack—it's about me wanting to feel good &amp; whole.

### However, despite doing ""everything else"" right, perfect nights of sleep have been rare.

For many years, stretching back maybe as far as middle school, I've felt almost **chronically sleepy in the morning, and on-and-off or completely tired throughout the day**. This never made me seriously worried about my health, although I did ask a doctor about it several times over the years with no good ""answer""—other than taking iron supplements which had no effect. I'm a healthy eater, I've either exercised or walked 1–3 miles daily, and my sleeping patterns were never *insane*—they were ""normal"" for kids my age, going to bed at between 22⁰⁰–0⁰⁰ (10pm–midnight) and waking up for school between 6⁰⁰–7³⁰.

However…""doing everything else right"" is a bit of a misnomer regarding my social life, or lack thereof. I've had my fair share of social &amp; emotional problems over the years—as we all do—and I'll readily admit that my social life was never *healthy*. Lots of running away from relationships; lots of shutting myself off from people outside of school hours.

That being said, the next-most-recent ""perfect night"" was actually *during* one of my most severe periods of loneliness/social problems, so I'm not convinced that social health is *too* much of a variable in this.

I'll also say that meditation has hands-down improved my sleep *quality* and *definitely reduced tiredness throughout the day* as I've gotten more and more consistent with it, as well as making me a lot happier (a LOT) in general. I started with the [Headspace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_yXe_6mYTA) app; highly recommended, hmu if you're interested. Basically, meditation plus a bunch of other life perspective changes have gotten me to the point where my everyday tiredness is no longer to the point where I'd necessarily *complain* about it, or even think about it very much…but I *know* it can be even better. I've experienced what a perfect rest looks like, and I want to wake up perfectly refreshed as often as possible. Maybe other life changes can accomplish this, but right now I'm seeing if tweaking my sleep pattern will do it.

### How do I go to sleep this early (dusk)?

One of the main things people question about sleep patterns like this is from the social angle: ""How do you possibly go to bed that early? **That's when people *do* things. Go out, see friends, go drinking, watch movies.**"" etc. Again, my own life has *definitely* not been emotionally or socially a piece of cake, and I've probably written books about this on r/lonely at this point—but suffice to say, *I* have nothing to lose on the social front by going to bed early. I've gone through cycles of loneliness enough times to realize that a huge part of what I previously thought were ""social problems"" is actually just an unapologetic fondness for solitude. (The label ""introvert"" might be useful.) And, I discovered that one of the benefits of my situation is that I have complete freedom to experiment with my me-time, including sleep experimentation.

**Aren't you wide-awake at dusk? Jeez, that can be like 8:30 PM.** It seems early at first, but if you slowly reduce your bedtime by half an hour each night, you can set it to be as early as you like. That's what I did, gradually. It helps to have a bedtime ritual. I *highly* doubt this is impossible for anyone to achieve.  
**What about roommates and your living situation?** My living situations over the past couple months have included college (no nighttime classes) and full-time internship situations (approximately ""9:00–5:00""s). In terms of housing, I've been: Alone in my own room; easy. In an apartment with roommates who were all introverts so they didn't make much noise at night; also easy. And, in an apartment with more ""regular"" roommates, including one who'd watch tv with her boyfriend *right* outside of my room and chat loudly; difficult at first but it's nothing I wasn't able to conquer with patience, mindfulness, and earplugs.

### Okay…so…why *biphasic* sleep? There are loads of other sleep hacks to try.

- **I'm consistently drawn to descriptions of how humans lived in the ""before-times"",** whether that be the paleolithic or pre-industrial era, because I'm strongly inclined to believe that many aspects of modern society have thrown me (and other people) seriously out of whack. I hope that whatever I can do to reproduce how things were—back before bullshit like after-work email expectations, ungodly school wakeup times, processed foods, horrible cattle living conditions, expectations to entertain ourselves long into the night, etc—will be a good thing.

- **I just love the mornings.** I'm not a ""morning person"" as if I have a particularly strong inclination towards waking up early (I don't always)—rather, I just think the dawn and early morning hours are really beautiful. I love the sunlight and the quietness and the crispness of the air and the feeling that I'm getting the jump on the day, and that no one else is gonna be bothering me.

- In a backwards way, **I want this to be supportive of my meditation practice.** When I read about the 1–3 hour window of relaxed alertness in the middle of the night on this sleep pattern, the first thing I thought was, ""Hmm…I wonder what meditation in that window would be like!"" Every period of the day has different advantages and obstacles for meditation (for me). *For example, right after work, monkey-mind is more of an obstacle; in the early morning, dullness is more of an obstacle; right after tantric masturbation, over-efforting is nonexistent &amp; lovingkindess is a breeze; right before bed, over-efforting is less of an obstacle but subtle dullness rears its head.* What quality does meditation have during the middle of this sleep pattern? …And even if it doesn't turn out to be a good time to meditate, that's okay—I'd be satisfied with any pattern that gives me perfect rest, so that when I *wake up* I feel great and my morning meditation session is amazing.

- I want to prepare **a common-denominator pattern that will work throughout my foreseeable future.** I can't guarantee that my future will include, for example, employers who let me nap in the middle of the day like the siesta sleep pattern requires. Also, I'm not nearly ambitious or weird enough to try [the extreme polyphasic patterns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iq_VKY0L_BA). Bimodal seems like the most ""safe"" pattern to get into, as I personally don't have commitments during the time required for it.

## Beginning the experiment

My next post will include the details of my first week or so. As of writing this, I'm about 5 days in, with varying results so far—**the very first night I tried this, I got the elusive ""perfect night of sleep *immediately*, but *not* the subsequent days.** So here's the basic plan &amp; how I'm thinking about this sleep experiment.

#### Time notation

Given how early I'm going to bed, I've found it easier to mark things with a 24-hour clock. Example:

**24-hr Clock**|**12-hr Clock**
-:|-:
17⁰⁰|5:00 PM
19⁰⁰|7:00 PM
20⁰⁰|8:00 PM
20³⁰|8:30 PM
0⁰⁰|Midnight
2⁰⁰|2:00 AM
6³⁰|6:30 AM

Maybe in future posts I'll also include ""translations"" into 12-hr time.

#### General routine

I've gotten into some good routines over the past month working at this meditation center, including overall consistency in my daily schedule as well as starting a [gratitude journal](https://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/yet-another-surprising-benefit-of-practicing-gratitude-youll-sleep-better.html) as my nighttime ritual, which certainly makes bedtime easier.

During this experiment, here will be the general arc of my preparation for the night:  
- ***No* big dinners.** Big dinners have been known to ""knock me out"" and leave me dull throughout the evening, which I can't afford because I still wanna get some shit done after work/school. So if I'm hungry, I eat a salad. If I'm not, I skip dinner. *I'm a smol guy with an excellent metabolism; also, my big meals are breakfast and lunch.* I've done a lot of googling on ""the best time to eat"" with no objective conclusions, so this is just what I'm finding feels best for me and works with my schedule.
- **Short yoga/stretching session.** I'm no master yogist; but, I *can* feel it in my body and mind that doing just 15 minutes to open myself up and get my blood flowing feels great for me and helps me appreciate my body. Also, I have a goal of getting flexible enough hips to meditate in Full Lotus position (which will probably be *really* long term, as my hips are tight af rn).
- **Meditation session.** Sometime not directly after eating, and not too soon before sleep.
- **Email.** If I need to catch up on anything.
- **Reddit.** Browse &amp; respond to messages *with a time limit so I don't go overboard*. I can get addicted to browsing the internet pretty easily (see r/nosurf if you think you do too), so I have to tell myself what time I'll get off every time I open up the laptop. **Also, yes, I have [f.lux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F.lux) to erase my screen's blue light.**
- **Stroll, and practice rapping.** By this time it's usually beautifully sunset-y outside. And setting aside time to actually pursue my music dreams is good for me. (It's a lot more tempting to just dream about them and procrastinate tho, lol.)
- **Bedtime ritual: gratitude journal.** This happens *in bed*, with my bedside lamp on. I expect it to take as long as half an hour each night (although it probably only takes 10–15 minutes to do it *well* in reality), and it's really useful because whenever my thoughts start ""drifting off"" to something bad, this helps me pull them back in to what I can appreciate. Currently it's not *just* gratitude; the first part is, *What did you notice today that was pleasant?* (to help me rev up the ol' positive-thinking engines), and the second part is, *What are you grateful/[thankful] for?* I may keep experimenting by trying different prompts, but for now I'll call this combo the ""gratitude journal"" section of the night.
- **Slumber!** Hopefully.
- ***Possibly* stuff to do during ""The Watch"".** My goal is to eventually determine if this middle area of the night is good for meditating, or if not, for reading a book or journaling. However, this goal can't be set in stone yet. In my first couple nights of the experiment, which I'll describe in my next post, I *tried* to set an alarm around the time I expected ""The Watch"" would begin, but I kept wrongly estimating the time when setting the alarm and also worrying in the middle of the night if I'd missed it. So nix that idea. Instead, at least in the beginning, I'll only sit up or get up if I *actually* feel the natural inclination to do so.
- **Morning alarm.** Just in case I don't feel a natural cue to wake up in the morning, I have this set—early, but not too early. (Since ""success"" during a bimodal sleep pattern apparently looks like naturally rising at dawn, then I might set this alarm for an hour or more after when dawn strikes.)

This is what my general routine has looked like so far:

|||*notes*
:-|:-|:-
17⁰⁰|Eat, yoga &amp; meditate, Reddit, other stuff|*Screen-time ends by 19⁰⁰.*
19⁰⁰|Stroll &amp; practice music|
20⁰⁰|In bed, gratitude journal|*Bedside lamp—75W, 120V, full spectrum. I wanna candle tho.*
20³⁰|Hopefully slumbering|*It's fully dark outside at about 20³⁰ rn. Onset of slumber is variable.*
?|""first sleep"" ends; ""the watch"" begins|
?|""second sleep"" begins|
?|Natural wakeup|
6³⁰|Alarm (just in case)|

**At the time of writing this,** I'm already about a week in. I'll say this much in advance: results are inconsistent so far, probably in part because of some variables I haven't controlled. **The first night I tried this, I felt absolutely amazing in the morning—it was actually one of those ""perfect nights"" of sleep.** The subsequent nights have been okay but not nearly replicas. Weird things that've come up to throw me off include:  
- Not being prepared for varying temperatures
- Leaving the window open and getting paranoid about the sounds of the woods, lol
- Jumping the gun and dreaming it's dawn and light behind my eyelids, but then opening them to find pitch blackness
- Kept awake wondering whether my experience aligns with the traditional descriptions of ""first sleep, watch, second sleep, wake"" (bc it's yet to align with that description)
- Getting subtly frustrated that my wakeups haven't been as good as the first night I tried

#### Terminology

`bimodal sleeping pattern` I'm specifically referring to the segmented sleeping pattern that occurs in one big chunk between dusk and dawn, *not* bi-whatever patterns where the other part is sometime during the day like siesta.  
`sleeping pattern` Bimodal, polyphasic, uberman, and siesta are all sleeping *patterns*.  
`schedule` My schedule is how I plan out my evening/day, in chunks (when I eat dinner, when I get off the computer, when I hit the pillow, etc.)  
`journal` My gratitude journal is my bedtime ritual (unless otherwise specified).  
`slumber` I use this to refer to the approximate moment I actually drift off into sleep, to distinguish it from the fairly-tired period of time between clicking off the light and falling into first sleep.  
`first sleep`/`dead sleep` In the bimodal sleeping pattern, this is the first portion of the night. ""Dead sleep"" was also used to describe it, and I sometimes find it fitting to use because the first segment *definitely* has felt more ""solid"" and ""dead"" then the second segment, where the sleep feels lighter and I've been on-and-off reawakening.  
`the watch` The period of time in between first and second sleep. I'm led to believe that this was between one and three hours in days of yore. This is where I want to try to meditate or read or something (or maybe just think about things, idk yet).  
`second sleep` The second sleep, from the end of the watch until dawn, ostensibly.  
`sleeplettes` So far, I haven't *actually* experienced the second sleep as a chunk in the same way that I *think* my first sleep is. Rather, what is described elsewhere as ""second sleep"" for me are these multiple mini-cycles of sleep, where I'll notice myself comfortably reawakening, opening my eyes to see how bright out it is, then cozily falling off into a light-ish dream/sleep state. This sleeplettes *feel* short; I can't tell because I make a point not to check the clock during the night because knowing what time it is makes me overthink and keeps me awake. But they feel as though they may be anywhere from half an hour to an hour and a half long. I've experienced at least a handful every night so far, and the experience *does* seem to be a different quality than whatever kind of sleep precedes the first sleeplette beginning (i.e. they feel different from what I *think* is ""first sleep"").  
— I may think of additional fitting terms as the experiment progresses; I'll always qualify them.

## What to expect next

As you can tell, I'm very detailed and enjoy writing a lot. I'm trying to include everything possibly relevant. This first post has been introductory, explaining some of the details and where I'm coming from in wanting to try out the bimodal pattern. The **next** posts will be in ""Nights *#*–*#*"" format—I've been reflecting on my sleep experience every morning, several hours after waking up, and each `log` is pretty detailed, including how I think my experience matched up with the ""first sleep, watch, second sleep, wake"" pattern, as well as any variables that I think might've thrown things off.

It'll probably be ""Nights 1–7"" or similar, and will include:  
1. a very brief introduction and hyperlink back to this post,
2. a summary of the subsequent individual logs and what my progress has been like so far in general, and then
3. each night's log typed up verbatim.

I'll do several of these. I'm not sure how many or how long I'm going to keep this up, but there will at least be two more of these posts, I'm pretty sure. Also note that the next month of my life is no longer going to be in such perfectly solitary conditions; I may be breaking my evening schedule up to one or two times per week because I'll be in a new part of the world and may want to explore a little at night. I'll obviously note that.

Always chasing that perfect night's slumber—until next time! //"

**If you want to be a newspaper writer**: Pitch your local newspaper, the paper in a nearby town or an alt-weekly. Look for a news hook or something they haven't covered. Good ""With taco fest coming up, I would love to write a piece detailing what will happen,"" ""With fall coming up, I would love to profile a local u-pick pumpkin farm.""

Likewise, if you want to be a journalist, check out the [free webinars from Poynter](https://www.newsu.org/). 

If you are fresh out of college and can't get a job: APPLY FOR EVERYTHING. Seriously, sometimes it takes 50 applications to get a job. Drop by r/resumes to get a review of your resume. Be willing to move. Be willing to take a (paid, preferably) internship. Try freelancing.

**Encouragement**: Yes. You can do this. It's not easy and you should not leave a full-time job if you do not have clients lined up or a huge stash of savings. Someone has to be a freelance writer. It can be you. But you will likely have to hustle. Not only do you have to write well, you have to find your own clients, market yourself, hire a tax person or do your taxes yourself, manage client expectations, manage a sometimes hectic schedule, motivate yourself.... Some people make a lot of money, other make decent money and most people will have a few months where they make a bunch followed by a few months where they can't find a single client, so be kind to yourself and know that it comes and goes. You get good clients and bad. Do your best to prioritize those clients that treat you right, pay well and pay on time and slowly drop the clients that suck. "
9bot2t,2,2018-08-30,I feel so exhausted,zoooolie,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9bot2t/i_feel_so_exhausted/,"I had a okay day. I went to my classes on time, got back home and cooked myself dinner. I did my assignments. I was feeling fine, but then this like wave of anxiety just came right over me, and now I don't know what to do anymore. Its like I can have a perfectly normal day where I do everything right, but then feel really shitty and hit rock bottom for no reason. I have so much to do, but I just can't get out of my bed and can't stop over thinking about everything. I hate how I'm basically failing college. Everyone else seems like they are managing so well (great gpa, internships, research, clubs, social life, everything - and just thinking about these makes me feel so miserable) , and I'm just a big mess. I hate reading job descriptions because they make me feel like total useless person. I feel so sorry for my parents. They don't deserve this mess as their daughter. If I just had a guarantee that they could be happy, I would just end things right now. I feel so horrible. I try to stop thinking about the mistakes I made in the past, and stop worrying so much about the future, but like once I start feeling anxious, I can't stop and it just gets worse and worse. And not getting things done makes me so anxious. I just feel like a huge ass mess and that things won't get better for me. I feel like I will always be this miserable and I will always be a huge mess who can't do anything right. I wish I could just go to bed now and never wake up again."
9bou2u,5,2018-08-30,What to do?,curiousindividual95,exmuslim,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/9bou2u/what_to_do/,"Okay, before I write the rest of the post, I'll just say that from what I can see, I'm in a relatively more privileged situation than most people that post here. I find it admirable how many of you are able to hold on &amp; get past your situation. I do not take the positive things in my situation for granted, &amp; I stand in solidarity with all other ex-Muslims. 

I'm in uae. I also have a dual citizenship, with the US being the passport in use. I became an ex-muslim two years ago, throughout the second half of medical school. I just graduated two months ago. 

I'm faced with a dilemma. I could do a year long internship here where I'm at, or I could skip it and try to get US experience instead. But in medicine all moves between graduation &amp; residency count, &amp; it would be a risk that could affect my career if I avoided internship. 

That being said, I'm honestly boiled up on the inside about the effects of Islam on society &amp; on myself, having taken it very seriously in the past. I've been able to come out as an atheist to my parents (who were very disappointed &amp; we tend to avoid the convo, despite them supporting me in other ways), &amp; my friends. Yet, for some reason, this doesn't feel enough. I'm continuously feeling angry about the injustice around me &amp; in the world about what's happening from Islam. I'm also still frustrated about the previous effects of Islam on my life (no dating, constantly worrying about hellfire, etc.) &amp; I feel like I have not yet expressed this properly.

So, is it normal that two years later I'm still angry, despite being able to tell some people I know? Does this justify me taking the risk &amp; going to the US where I can express my views more freely &amp; openly, have a better dating scene, &amp; meet more like-minded people? I'm also not that super passionate about becoming a physician tbh if it doesn't work out, if possible I could just shift to something else. 

Ofc my situation is too nuanced. What I would like to hear is whether for you guys, the changes in moving to the West (or living independently in the West in general) overall really improved your mental health. It's just, I can't tell if I'm really in need of a change of environment, or I just need to see the positive in my situation &amp; recognize that there's no need to rush it &amp; that eventually I will be able to express my ideas openly &amp; support human rights in muslim-majority countries."
9bp7hq,1,2018-08-30,My boyfriend (20M) and I (F21) are supposed to move in together but I'm having second thoughts.,Whoareyou24602,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9bp7hq/my_boyfriend_20m_and_i_f21_are_supposed_to_move/,"My boyfriend and I attend the same University. Last Winter he started talking about wanting to live together, and I was resistant to the whole idea. We had just gone through some stuff and I wasn't very comfortable with moving in together given that. Eventually, however, I agreed and we looked at different apartments and whatnot. I'll be honest, once I said yes I started to get sort of excited about it, especially when it came to picking out a place and looking for furniture etc. I'd lived on campus my first two years of school so the idea of an apartment was very exciting. 

&amp;#x200B;

I ended up getting an internship for this Fall so I'm not living in the apartment with him until Spring, but the excitement of picking out furniture and whatnot has started to wear off and I'm not sure I want to live with him after all. I've enjoyed having my own place so far while living away for my internship, and after having stayed with him all Summer I like having the personal space. His reasoning makes sense, it's cheaper to live together and when I was living on campus I spent most nights at his place anyway, but I'm just not sure about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to tell him that I'd rather sublease from a friend in the Spring, but when I've mentioned that a few weeks ago it really upset him. I understand why, given I had agreed in the past. My internship is rotational, so I'd be back in another city again next Summer. Maybe it would be better to just give it a try for the Spring, but I'm worried if I do that and still have doubts it'll be even harder to move out without it being blown out of proportion. At the same time, I don't want to upset him and feel like I'm going back on a promise. When I first tried bringing it up a few weeks ago I said I would still pay half of the rent on top of whatever rent I'd be paying at the sublease, but that didn't really help. 

&amp;#x200B;

Should I try bringing it up with him again? Or should I try living with him in the Spring, and if it doesn't work out move out fully when I leave for my second rotation of internship? Thanks for any advice."

I know this might be controversial, and I fully understand why. I'm going to spend a long time so that I can get my thoughts out as helpfully, eloquently, and politely as possible. I don't mean any offense to anyone, naturally, and (though it might already be clear from my posting in here and... well, existing in this reddit) *I adore this game.* This game has meant so much to me, and during my playthrough in Beta I was so thorough I *made maps of my personal islands and* ***checked off every house I looted.***

(This, uh, isn't a playthrough style I recommend, naturally. It was fun in its own way, though, and I assume it's helpful in terms of comprehending how fucking much I love this game.)

I love this game, I respect Compulsion, I'm not looking for drama or fights with anyone over this. I *am* seeking a discussion, and most importantly some answers.

Now! Facts.

If you've seen the Faraday quest notes-- specifically the note from the bobbies about the 'bird' and her 'cage'-- they mention two ""confirmed bachelors"" who have been sent to sit with Faraday in Lud's Holm. These are Roger and James, who are boyfriends. They have a drawing up of them together on a boat, they scrawled ROGER + JAMES in a heart on a chalkboard... James is first heard yelling *""Why did I have to* ***fall for*** *a mechanical idiot?""* or something to the same effect.

A confirmed bachelor is a gay man. Period end point dot done. You can look it up and find it's also been used in Fallout (apparently) and, while not common nowadays, it's... well, it's pretty legitimate gay slang. And you can see why! Without marriage equality, a man not attracted to women would never wed. He'd be a confirmed bachelor.

Here's where the conflict starts, so buckle in.

There is-- was? unsure if the death screens still exist at all, especially this one-- a death screen that called Arthur a confirmed bachelor. You can read it [here](http://creepturtle.tumblr.com/post/148127063207/i-died-from-dehydration-and-literally-every-part), and we *do* know some material from the screens is still canon, because Arthur mentions Sparky once!

Inevitably, someone noticed that text, and they ran to Compulsion.

[Compulsion got cheeky.](https://twitter.com/compulsiongames/status/759524652968398848)

Now, there's the obvious caveat that, you know... Compulsion didn't say yes/no. Whoever runs the account might know nothing about the story. This was a long-ass time ago.

But we have to recognize... they called Arthur a confirmed bachelor in the canon game materials. That means *gay,* and it means gay and not bi and not 'maybe something or maybe something else'. Whether in coded language or slang or otherwise... they called their main character (at the time; let's admit Arthur has always been advertised as the main guy) gay. And no amount of thumb-twiddling or jokes will remove that.

This is when the gay fans fucking exploded.

For me, personally, I was unbelievably happy. I don't play a lot of games. I hadn't been excited for a game coming out... maybe ever? And this I had been on board with since the Kickstarter. *A random thing that meant the world to me was going to have a character who was in the same community as me.* This is the equivalent of you finding a dollar, and turning it over and finding a piece of gold taped to the back. Obvious note here that not everyone will understand the feeling of gay representation, but I'm sure we all get why it is theoretically important. People see gay folks in the media, gay folks are normalized, gay kids feel better about being gay, yadda yadda.

Now, I wasn't the only person panicking. Lots of other gay fans were really excited, and I talked to tons of people about the game, a couple of whom then bought it. A game with a gay main character? An *indie* game with a gay lead? Damn, we have to support this.

On the other hand, a considerable amount of discourse started. We had ""it's still okay to ship Arthur/Sally or Arthur/Pru or Arthur/Victoria or whatever the hell because he's not confirmed gay :) ! they just *used a word that can only mean gay to describe him.""* And ""maybe he's BI.... did you fools ever think of that... maybe he's BI... let's pair him exclusively with women and not even consider that he might be attracted to men."" And ""he's not canon gay! he's not canon gay! they just *USED THIS WORD THAT LITERALLY CAN ONLY MEAN GAY TO DESCRIBE HIM IN CANON!* arthur isn't gay until he says with his own two lips that he's the gayest gay in all of wellington gays!!"" I swear to you I heard all of these opinions, though obviously I've mocked them a teeny tiny bit.

Well.

I started playing the Beta and was a bit confused-- Pru (at that time, Damp Diary Lesbian) thought Arthur was making eyes at her? Ha, that's funny! He's gay! Poor gal mistook the 'fellow gay! :')' look for the 'let's fuck! :')' look. Hilarious. But this was the only thing about Arthur potentially liking gals that I saw, so I could kind of toss it out the window. And, after all, they *confirmed he was gay in the canon material of the game,* so none of it really mattered.

And we made great jokes in our gay little WHF Skype groupchat! (Remember Skype? That's how old this lore is). Look at this comment Arthur makes about that dude who takes all your medical supplies in the Garden District (does this encounter still exist? Something about a marriage?) As he asks for more and more, Arthur says ""what's next, he'll want me to pay for dinner?"" Ha! Gay joke! Even though it has nothing to do with attraction to men! We Are Too Hopeful!

And I remember, very specifically, the line in Old Soldiers that I actually went back through the playthrough for.

*""Does your father know what kind of man you are?""*

*""I'm afraid he might have suspected, sir.""*

I feel like, in the context of this post, it's not hard to see how I took that. I'm going to get a little bit personal here (as if I haven't already) and say that I, like many LGBT folks, have trouble with my parents. I cut some more personal stuff here, but let's leave the DaHanci lore at that.

I know this line does not reference what I thought it did. But for a desperate LGBT person playing their first canonically LGBT game, I don't think it's unreasonable to mention how it sounded. And how it felt to have the feeling that someone else-- this character who I loved so much-- had been through the same thing as me. I laughed about this to friends; Arthur's yet another gay who doesn't get along with his parents! What else is new? Arthur's another gay who hates his father, what else is new? Arthur...

Obligatory note that I know Compulsion doesn't owe me anything; I just felt like it would be dishonest to leave that out. I *do* feel very personally attached to this issue and to this game as a whole, and it would be silly to hide it. You can ignore it if you like; it's irrelevant to my larger point, for the most part.

I told myself, every month leading up to the final release, that Arthur would have no canon boyfriend. That he might have a one-off line about liking boys, or more about his relationship with his father, but we would never see canonical flirting. Because, let's face it, this is a survival game. We have more important things to do. A romantic relationship would take away from the plot, and a *gay* romantic relationship? God, why not just put a big *GIVE US MORE 1 STAR REVIEWS, LADS* sign in the middle of the Garden District?

Don't get your hopes up. There will be no romance in Arthur's playthrough.

\--

I actually thought, watching the first cutscene with Sally, *hey, are they flirting?* I honestly wasn't sure. Because there had been not a hint of romantic attraction-- no, not even in *Lies*! I was a bit confused, but, you know... literally everything with a man and a woman can be considered romantic attraction in media, so I moved on.

Cue smooch.

Look, I was hopeful even then. Maybe Sally has feelings-- that's fine! I mean, okay, I was #1 member of the Maybe Sally Is A Lesbian How Cool Would That Be party, but I'm not an idiot. Obviously if a character has no canon sexuality, who knows, right? Maybe *she's* bi, hell, maybe she's straight, we always see the gay-character-likes-straight-character trope but this would be a GREAT time to do the inverse and we could maybe have some depth have some conversations have... Arthur's journal entry.

So he likes her. Canonically. And he likes her romantically. And we are now two years past the days of 'confirmed bachelor' Arthur.

""There will be no romance,"" I told myself. ""Because there is no room.""

But there was room. There was room for Arthur to flirt not just with Sally, but with the woman in Love Birds (if you speak to her before you get the flowers). There was room for *straight* Arthur.

What was there no room for? There was no room for a single line, not even one line, that could have suggested Arthur was interested in men.

And then I go and I talk about it, and I get the inevitable: there are other gay characters. What more do you want, for the leading man who was explicitly said to be gay to actually turn out to be gay? What's wrong with you? To which I want to say, how do you not see that this is different? How do you not see how Arthur, the main character, would be different from the side-quested woman who is *implied* to have had a girlfriend who planted lilies with her, or the lesbian who dies in the end, or the two gay characters who are simple comic relief, one of whom used to die at the end of the encounter (before Compulsion, and I have an unbelievable amount of respect for them for this, changed the encounter both to remove Roger from the pole and to not have him die)? How is it difficult to see?

Nobody thinks Compulsion did this maliciously. *I* don't think that, and I'm likely the most upset about this out of anybody. I feel stupid; why did I let myself hope after Compulsion used this specific language that *in their own universe* meant gay? Why did I let myself believe that a character once named gay would *stay* gay? Why did I let myself believe it might be time for anything, anything at all for gay characters in video games? Why did I believe?

I have been upset for a while now, though. I've spoken to other gay fans. There is a sizable collection that feels, alternately, burned/disappointed/tricked/stupid. Who have already done this so many times. Who spent money-- $30-60!-- on this game, who supported it so strongly partially because we believed they would be brave enough for this impossible thing, this canonically gay main character, and that it would impact their sales because we know how we are seen.

This game was my world. For weeks, months it was all I thought about. My icon on social media pages was Arthur; I gathered merch and wallpapers and lockscreens. I wrote, drew, theorized, ate, slept, breathed this game. I am not the only one.

Something in me wants to know why, and how, this happened. Who it was that either said *we can lie to this part of the fanbase, who will support us for it* or *we have to change this for the story, and never mind this one part of the fanbase, who will not know until it is too late.* Again, I do not think it was done maliciously. It is possible, entirely, that an intern wrote that tweet. It is possible that Compulsion did not realize how it would come off, and meant it as a joke somehow-- haha! he'll never marry because he's dead! this makes sense with us using the term explicitly for gay people!

It is also possible that Gearbox, or Microsoft, or some higher-up decided this was not okay. That the gays would just have to wait a little bit longer. That this would not fly with the mass public, despite the drugs and the violence. That this was too much, and had to be dropped.

I do want to know. I am not the only one who wants to know. If anyone has information, particularly game admins, I would genuinely like to know. I am not angry. But I am disappointed, and I do not think it is an overreaction, after all this, to be disappointed.

\---

The obvious, necessary disclaimer that you may not like this post, and you may be angry at it. Please move quietly along. I would rather not have the obvious said to me-- that I was stupid to trust anyone to bring any kind of representation, whether or not they had already canonically said they would. That this was not the strongest indication of a character being gay that Compulsion could have given. That things change. Please just silently keep scrolling if this bothers you, and don't start any drama over something that I would sincerely like to be a polite discussion. Questions naturally welcome if I was unclear about any of this.

\--

**TLDR** Arthur was canonically gay and now he definitely isn't, and is likely canonically straight. I'm upset, as are some others. Wondering why/how this happened and would like to discuss it on some level. Please be civil; we all love this game here and there's no reason to start a fight."
9bpzib,7,2018-08-30,Why don’t people choose Military Medical School Scholarships?,dazalia,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/9bpzib/why_dont_people_choose_military_medical_school/,"I attempted to look for a more balanced opinion but found it to be very difficult. I received an email the other day about the Us Air Force Medical School Scholarship which made me begin to consider what it really means to be a military doctor. It can’t be all pros- there’s a reason why others aren’t choosing it as part of their path to be a future position and I wanted to hear why and what made others take the final step to pursuing the path they chose. (People who considered it and decided not to, people who are actively considering it, and all others!)


Pros:


-504 MCAT/above 3,4 gpa accepted

-Stipend for living and board given during med school

-Up to $400K tuition covered

-Internships every summer that cover living, board, plus give you stipends

-higher than average residency salary (starting around $100K I think? This one I wasn’t too sure about. I kept seeing things about it having to do with military rank.)

-if somehow, you don’t match anywhere, you are covered for post grad training

-all the practicing locations are in the US

-severe discounts on food, clothing, and housing

-more secure hospitals

-not in war zones 


Cons:

-you have to apply to military match (but if you don’t make it, you can still apply to civilian match)

-you’re limited to the positions that the military needs during match season (not guaranteed the specialty you want, although they’ll support you entering with most competitive specialties/general practice)

-you have to be with them for at least four years following med school (not entirely sure if this is after residency or not)

-location is based on need and specialties available (still might be moved around to different US bases during your time with them maybe?)

-you have to pass a military fitness test (not as big of a deal but still something I’d have to train for, regardless)


Anyone who has considered military medical scholarships/anyone who chose not to pursue them, can you let me know why you made the decision? Or if any of my points listed are incorrect or missing something? 

Also, would this be more appropriate to post in the medical school subreddit? I just decided on putting it in the premed subreddit because you would be applying for this scholarship around the same time you apply to medical schools.

Thank you so much!

I always bought medicine was the path for me because I love interacting with people, helping them, and simply being there for them. These factors were my primary drive to pursue the field.

While I didn’t enjoy many of the basic classes we had to take, I thought it would get better soon. I was waiting to really connect with the field. Once we started the actual medical classes, I was excited to finally learn what I set out to learn. However, I struggled a lot. Every single day I would wake up wit anxiety of when my next exam would be, go through the motions of 8-5 class, 7-2am studying, repeat.

But I didn’t want to leave. I wanted to be with my friends, I wanted to make my family proud, I wanted to tell myself I could do it. I worked harder than I could ever imagine and constantly motivated myself after each failure. But...it just wasn’t working. 

I realized my heart just wasn’t in the material. I didn’t enjoy the science, my foundations were poor, and every single day was torture. After weeks of deliberation, blood, sweat, and tears, I made the decision to leave the program.

My friends were overjoyed that I could make such a decision. My family supported me and said they were happy that I was looking into things that would make me happy. I switched into business, decided that I would love to eventually become a hospital administrator and have put my 100% every single day.

The day I changed my major, I updated my LinkedIn, worked on my resume, and applied to over 30 business internships. 

And I got an interview for a marketing firm.

I went to the interview, got a call back to come for the second round, and got the position yesterday! My friends and family are ecstatic, impressed, and proud of me. Everything is moving in a good direction and I’m happy I could have the initiative and self-drive to chase after what I want"
9bttlj,64,2018-08-31,My [21F] parents [50s F/M] are affecting/trying to control my relationship with my boyfriend [23M],sadthrowaway602,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9bttlj/my_21f_parents_50s_fm_are_affectingtrying_to/,"**tl;dr My parents don't really like my boyfriend, and they're starting to show it (even to him). I don't want to ruin my relationship with either side, but things can't continue like this.** 

Some background: My boyfriend (let's call him Kyle) and I met about two years ago, when I was a freshman and he was a junior. We've been dating about a year and a half. He has since graduated (while I am a junior now) and will be working in a city about 4 hours away by bus. He was also away his senior year on exchange, so it's not like we haven't done long distance before. 

Since the relationship began, my parents warned me about the struggles of long distance/time commitment/etc. I really like this guy, though, and I think they could tell, so they didn't say too much. Around the one year mark, they sat me down and told me about their concerns with a long-distance (and now longer-term) boyfriend, how they didn't think I was getting to know him enough, how he could probably cheat on me easily, etc. Obviously, I didn't really listen and continued the relationship, but I could tell they were displeased. They claimed ""they want to get to know him better.""

So I invited Kyle to my house over one of our breaks (about a week long), so that my parents could interact with him for longer than a dinner. He seemed to get along well with my mom, but my dad didn't really speak to him, and when he did, was curt. 

I spent the summer in the same city as Kyle, where we both had internships. We have a lot of overlapping hobbies, so it was probably one of the best summers I've ever had. He took care of me and helped me out even when I didn't ask. It was pretty far from my parents, but I called and updated them a lot. My parents are pretty conservative though, and they wouldn't like that Kyle slept over sometimes (as in they'd probably give me hell/pull me out of school/whatever they could to break us up), so we had to hide that from them. 

Near the end of July, my parents drove over for a visit, and Kyle and I showed them around. That night, I stayed in the hotel with them while Kyle went back to his apartment. After he left, my dad tried to have a serious talk with me about Kyle. He told me to ""think of the future"" in this relationship. Basically, he felt that Kyle is beneath me in looks, intellect, and personality, and that I should keep my options open even if I'm in this relationship. I felt really hurt that he would suggest this of someone I love and even suggest that I should keep an eye out for ""taller, more handsome guys"". My dad kept telling me that HE could tell Kyle wasn't right for me and wouldn't be satisfied until I saw it for myself and broke up with him. My mom, who was just listening, left at this point, saying my dad was ""such a judgmental fake"". My dad admitted that Kyle was a good person, and he understood why we got along so well, but he insisted that I could ""do better"".

I was extremely upset at him, said some mean things, and stormed back into my own room. My mom came by to comfort me and told me that the most important thing is that I like who I'm with. She mentioned that she made a mistake marrying my dad, which made me burst into tears. We haven't talked about it since. 

Kyle gets the feeling my parents don't like him, and asks me after every almost interaction if they're upset at him.  I know he's a little insecure, so that might play a part, but I think my dad is way too obvious with the way he treats Kyle. It borders on disrespectful sometimes, like claiming Kyle's job is something ""anyone could pick up"" and making snide comments about his sense of style. 

I love my parents, and I love Kyle, but I feel like as I continue this relationship, it's going to cause everyone stress in the future. I just don't know what to do. I've tried telling my dad it's my relationship and that he needs to stop interfering, but he just pulls the ""I'm your father and I'm looking out for you"" card. I don't want to cut my parents off at all -- when we don't talk about Kyle, everything is honestly wonderful. But I can't imagine just not talking about Kyle forever, especially since we're going pretty steady. Help? "

We basically spent our entire summer exploring this city and since then we have eventually broken up through a slow and awkward process (not my idea), but I actually got a job that I applied for over there and I was an idiot thinking we could still be friends and keep in touch because I thought we had things in common that could still make for a rewarding friendship, but the moment I arrived in said city to do my first week of work I was just overwhelmed with feelings of nostalgia of what we used to have just from being in that location again.


I really thought I was over it but I've just been a mess the entire day. On top of that she's been acting super weird and never wants to hang out with me, she unfollowed my instagram and told me she did it because ""it was annoying"" when I asked her about it but I can still see her stalking my insta-stories every single day since. I know this all sounds petty, but I'm so sad and confused and hurt. I knew I had to just rip the bandaid off and block her on all of my social media today or I was never gonna recover from this.


I feel like I'm the bad guy here and that I'm the one wasting the chance of us staying in touch, but I don't understand her behavior or what she wants from me and I can't live like this. I didn't think I would get this overwhelmed with sadness from remembering our time together. I really loved her and I wish our time together had never ended. I know I will recover from this, and my friends have told me they feel like she had a habit of gaslighting me and that I should've gotten out of it a long time ago. I still have trouble seeing it clearly because I'm still in the phase of rationalizing the behavior of those you love, but I don't doubt them. I hope I will get to the point where I will see it too. This grieving process is still so damn painful and hard. There are fucking flavors of beer in that city that remind me of her. I hate it.


I know I'm just going to have to spent today venting my emotion. I figured this was the right place to turn just to start the process and get it out, and also to not feel as alone as I am feeling now. Thanks."

She rudely TOLD him to sit down twice and gave him an attitude the whole time she was helping him. Her attitude in general pisses me off, but since she acted that way with my dad who was in pain I’m absolutely furious. She didn’t know it was my dad but if she did I think she might have acted differently. What do you guys suggest I do about this?

She was 6 years older than me, ran off to the UK Midlands with a naredowell got hitched, got pregnant, lost it through domestic violence and got pregnant again, I met her 2 years later with a toddler and  the most captivating honest face you ever saw. I was fucked. I perused her, intoxicated I was! There was no trap. We were living together 3 months after we met.
Early nineties, fuckin mad! Yokes everywhere, party till you die. Life was beautiful. Had a great relationship with a pretty girl, loved the bones of her little boyxxxxx 
But still mad as a brush!! Volunteered for overseas and off to the Lebanon for six months. Strange times......Hard to maintain a relationship at a distance, but we were in love and I came home safe and we said we can do it again.. one more trip to Lebanon we could buy a house, get married.....
So I volunteered again and embarked. Two weeks after getting off the first chalk I get a call on the  sat phone(SattPhoneFFS). She's late. Baby on the way. Ecstatic, everyday was an eternity till I got home.

Sorry I'm boring the shit out of you with banality 
Edit:
Sorry I was bursting for a piss, the rum n coke runs through me.

Anyway home I came, immune to alcohol and an unshakeable stoicism. 
Boy arrived, all was wonderful, fatherhood was what I was made for, we were made....of sand. Her ghosts never left her. We fought over all the usual mundane shit and somewhere along the line lost each other. There were many days I prayed to get a detail in the barracks for some shit mopping and carrying job for a flat cap, any reason not to go home.
Booze became both our outlets, me with the lads at work, her at home with her mates.

It was a world of shit. She was an abusive drunk. Would go missing for days. Not a good place for a soldier. Absenteeism is not tolerated. Showing up 2 days late for barrack guard with the face scratched off you brought no sympathy. 
4 years of hell ensued. You never know* your done till your done.
When boy was 6 I walked out on it all.
Her sister had moved in, back from that damned London, a smack head turned what was left of a home into a crack den. 
The whole thing was a clusterfuck. I just ran away. Went in to the barracks, handed in my kit and went on 24 hours notice. 14 years down the fucking tubes.
At first there was the withdrawal, then the overwhelming guilt for running out on the boys. 
It was boom time in Ireland and I found myself a job labouring on endless timber framed estates. I tried to start again. 
Went to a solicitor and got visitation, at that point boy had become her weapon of mass destruction. Too many years of hate had destroyed all civility .
Edit:
You know what,  hindsight is amazing. The ability to solve all your problems after the fact. Coulda, woulda, shoulda. Fucking brilliant.
I drifted.
Boy on a Friday night and Sunday afternoon. He was the only light in my life.
I was just another faceless gooner with loud mates. Lines of gac and party gear blocking out the self loathing. Bouts of clinical depression, self medicating with Jameson and bags of weed. Fucking aimless weekend warrior and midweek worrier.
Weeks blur in to months and then years. 
Isn't it funny how you can't see what's right in front of your face?
The boy, 16 now is acting up. Trouble at school. No pitching up, disruptive. But you'll always believe your own, they're wrong. My boy ain't like that! Ignore that shit.
So 40 creeps up on me before I know it. Existential dreads. I decide I need purpose.
I enroll at college, you know, no clue where any of its going but a BA is a direction right?I knuckle down and start to really enjoy it. At last, rolling out of bed in the morning with a pep in my step.
The Boy and are living together now, coaching each other through school. Clarity. It's a revelation. I hadn't had peace of mind since 1993. Hope. Maybe it's finally happening for me. 
I graduated in Sept. 2009 with  BA honours in Eng.Lit. and History.
The World was my oyster. The boy had settled down. Passed the leaving without making any records but he was in a good place.
Edit:
At this point I'd had enough of Old Erins isle. 2010, 40 years old and the economy in the tank I started applying to NGO's abroad. I got an unpaid internship in Southern Africa with a conservation group. I discuss it with boy and book the ticket.
I arrive in Swaziland in early 2011 and throw myself into the work. It's community based education in wild life conservancy with a tourism aspect that tries to empower local agrarian people. 
There isn't a fucking paddy for a thousand km. It's like being reborn. I found myself on beach without footprints. Absolute liberation. New people with no knowledge or interest in what I did yesterday, only a willingness to allow me to be involved in something greater than the sum of those involved. 
So I've been living the dream for the best part of 8 years now. Doing things that I love, helping to improve the lives of others and through that perhaps selfishly increasing my personal joy and feeling absolutely no guilt for that.
I met a great woman, told her my horrid tale of woe is me and she didn't laugh or run away. We got married three months ago and are making our way together with mutual respect and understanding and real love based on those values. But this is a great saga and those don't end with happily ever afters.
Edit:
So boy is now 24. After I departed for Africa he started an apprenticeship as an electrician and as far as I knew all was well. He was a popular lad, a half decent footballer and had a nice girlfriend. We always stayed in contact as much as that was possible when I was in remote areas. 
Our conversations were your typical Irish father/son scenario. You know what I mean... how's life? Grand. Any news? Naw. Did you watch the football blah blah blah.
I suppose at this point I was wholey consumed by my new life.
We could go without talking to each other for a couple of months at a time. I lived by the old adage- no news is good news right?
But I had a gut feeling all was not well. Nothing I could put my finger on, just an intuition I suppose. 
I was still in contact with some old mates at home and would often ask if they had seen boy around. Most often the replies were vague at best, yea yea he's looking well.
Then last year I went home for a couple of weeks, introduced my then girlfriend to family and friends. Met boy. What a wonderful thing it was to wrap my arms around him, he'll always be my baby though a grown man now. 
He seemed to be in good form, told me all the things I wanted to hear.
Then the day before I was flying back we had arranged a family get together and he didn't pitch up.
I was very disappointed to say the least but there were no alarm bells ringing.
So as I have said I got married 3 months ago and I really wanted him to be there. I tried to call him several times, left messages, whatsapp, Facebook etc. All to no avail. I started to panic. Why wasn't he returning my calls? Had I done or said something to irritate or upset him?
I contacted my brother, his God father, to ask him to check up on Boy. Make sure he was ok. Then the bombshell..
My brother told me he'd heard that he'd lost his job, wasn't showing up for work and when he did he was arriving in drunk or stoned. I don't blame his boss for letting him go, you act the bollocks like that then you need to accept the consequences.
So my brother catches up with him eventually. I get the call. He's fucked up on tablets I'm told.WTF!!! Out of his mind on xanax/diasapam. He's knocking back 50 or more a week. 
I'm devastated. How could this be possible? He had everything going for him. Finally I get to talk to him. He's in a bad way. I jump on a flight home. We sit and have a heart to heart. It was deja vu. It was like staring in to my own eyes. The hurt and desperation, the sense of hopelessness. I identified with all of it. We agreed to get him help, counselling, drug rehab, what ever it took to get him well again. So I stayed around for a month while he was in Rehab. Went to see him as much as I was permitted, did the sessions and gave him all the support I could. He finished rehab and really seemed to be in a better place. I had to return to work so I asked him to come down and stay with me for a while. You know, get out of the environment that had been dragging him down but he said, listen Dad- I'm fine, you needn't worry, I'm going to get a new job, get my life on track, you go back we'll talk everyday on the phone.
To tell you all the truth I was sceptical but my life was in Africa now and I had to get back to work and my own endeavors. So I left.
We got married on the 3rd of May. It was the happiest day of my life. My brothers came down for the event and all news from them on Boy was positive, he was working again, his old boss had given him a second chance. Fair play. We face timed that evening and he was in top form. It topped off the perfect day.
Last Tuesday.
Busy at work I get a call from home. My heart sank in to my boots. Boy is in hospital after a near fatal over dose. Not accidental. He had a note in his hand when he was found.
I'm beside myself.
I can't get time off to go home. My brothers are there looking after him, He's been assessed, doctors say he is clinically depressed and has been self medicating with booze and pills. Sound familiar????????
I'm overcome with guilt right now. I know I'm not directly to blame for any of it but it's obvious to me that my hands are not clean. There has to have been something I could have done. Some glaring signals that I've been oblivious to that could have prevented what is now a monumental clusterfuck. Again....
He's now in a secure unit for his own safety. I'm contemplating moving home to see if I can rescue him from this self destructive spiral that he's on. 
Life is a fucking tragic comedy all right. 
My reason for posting this I think was as a cathartic exercise. I needed to tell someone how I'm feeling. Not looking for sympathy or advice. Just maybe to let others know that you should never be complacent, life is not perfect, there is every chance that tomorrow will bring with it some* tragic news that can shatter your reality and illusions that all is well in the world.

9bvfuy,1,2018-08-31,"I [23M] really need some help. It's been 2.5 weeks since I broke up with my ex [23 F] of 2.5 years. I was miserable during the relationship, but now I feel broken. (Super Long Post)",Zarotu,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9bvfuy/i_23m_really_need_some_help_its_been_25_weeks/,"Forgive me, this is long.

I met my ex (let’s call her Jessica) back in high school, freshman year of homeroom. I immediately developed a crush on her. Despite my many attempts to ask her out, she flaked out on me because I didn’t have a car (nor my license). She eventually started dating someone after high school ended and moved to Seattle for university. Everyone knew I liked her, but she chose someone else. I had a full-ride scholarship for my state college, so obviously I stayed home. I did my best to improve myself, making special friends and improving myself so physically, socially, and mentally. But, two years after I started high school, Jessica came back and started going to my school. I saw her around. She sent a SnapChat to me that reminded us of the days back in high school, and I reminded of the dinner she promised, but flaked out on. She said okay. She was still with her boyfriend at the time, so the dinner turned into a friendly lunch. I wasn’t expecting anything from the lunch as I was really focused on getting a high score on the MCAT for medical school.

A month later, I discovered that the pictures of her and her boyfriend were gone from her Instagram. I was already interested in another girl at the time, tried asking her out many times, but that failed. *Three years later, now, she admits to liking me and asked why we never went out more. But that’s another story.* We have been sending SnapChats to each other many times since lunch, so I decided it was a good idea to ask her out to the movies since the other girl already went. Again, I wasn’t really expecting anything, and I was looking for a break from my studies. We started hanging out during school. After I took my exam, she treated me to ice cream. I don’t usually hang out with people, so it was nice. Eventually, we started dating. I was happy. After liking someone for 6 years, I am finally dating her. At the time, I thought things were going fast. It was too late when I realized it had been only two months since she ended things with her ex.

\------

THE STRESS

During the relationship, I did everything I could to make her happy. At the start, I took her to and from school, even though she lived right next to the shuttle and could easily get to school by car within 5 minutes. I was dumb at the time, as I always woke up early and took my brother to school at 6:30 a.m. and waited outside her house until she woke up at 8:00. I guess she started taking advantage of me, as she began asking me to wake her up. I would have to call her, and eventually had to get a key to her home in order to physically wake her up. Despite getting to school at 6:30 in the morning, I was always late to class.

She didn’t have a job back then and was given $50 weekly allowance from her mom to pay for her parking. Her mom also made her lunch. But, I spoiled her. Realizing that she could save money because she didn’t need to pay for parking, she started using her money to buy lunch. This continued for a bit before her mom stopped making her lunch. Obviously, she had no control with her money with the food and clothes she bought, and I ended up paying for her food because she would have nothing else to eat. I usually ate my own lunch, but since we had to go to restaurants, I had to pay for the both of us. I love to save money. Seeing my bank account that I had grown over the years drop, I was upset. But, I guess I loved her more. There was an incident where I skipped work (I was paid by the minute) to feed her. She got upset when I did not buy her coffee and started to cry.

There were other times where I felt used, such as making me get to class late with her because she didn’t want to walk in the classroom alone while the professor had already started. It was terrible as the distance caused me to sweat, a lot. It was embarrassing for me. I couldn’t even sit by my friends because she was intimated by them (we were all aiming for a medical profession, but everyone except me were attractive people, even the guys). There was a time when we were already late, but she was hungry and had no money. Of course, I had to wait outside and pay for her food while she went to class.

During school, she always procrastinated with her studies and homework. I was ahead of her because not all of her credits transferred from UW Seattle. I was already stressed from my own school work and I cannot work anywhere other than my home or school. But, she wanted me to be with her at her home, with no desk for me or anything, or at Starbucks, where everything is loud. I had to help her get through her homework, did her quizzes for her, let her copy my assignments, did her attendance, gave her my past exams and textbook, etc. I did my best to helped Jessica get through the pharmacy school application process, working on her personal statement with her, practicing her interview, and helping her get and internship at a hospital. The one time I asked her to help me with something. I wasn't feeling well, but I wanted her to cover for my attendance at school. I always covered for her, but obviously, she decided not to.

A few months into our relationship, her mom caught Jessica using her credit card. After I helped her take down her bunk bed and helped her get a larger bed for her room now that her sister was gone, she began using the card her mom gave her for books to buy bed sheets, etc. $440 was spent and she was caught. I came over to her house to give support and she was bawling all over me, unsure of what to do. She started to blame her parents for not ever buying her anything, which upset me because my parents didn’t give me an allowance, let alone pay for anything (besides academics). The only solution I could come up with is that I would pay the money she owed her mom, with the promise that she would pay me back. She promised at least $50 a week as she just started her job in a retail pharmacy, which I helped her get in after she failed to get in many times before.

Obviously, it was a stupid move as she immediately wanted to go on vacation. Guess whose credit card was used to pay for the flight and hotel. She promised she would pay me back. But, a year later, not only did she take forever to pay me back, the money she owed me grew. She was always out of money and I had to pay for her to eat food. She says her mom doesn’t make her lunch anymore and she doesn’t want to buy groceries for herself. She even promised to split the bill for our anniversary, but apparently bought a dress, cried that she was stressed from school and spent all her money on food, and I ended up paying for the entire expensive, terrible “luxury” food. She also attempted to pass money that her mom gave me in an envelope for Chinese New Year as payment for what she owed me.

I bought her a leather makeup bag from Kate Spade for her birthday. But, she didn't want it. I had to return it to get a necklace for her, but it was too big for her. So, I had to go to the store with her to get her the necklace she wanted.

Many times, I tried to talk to her about how I felt unappreciated or used. About how I hated how she treated her mom by constantly yelling at her. About how I, someone who doesn’t like money, hate eating out and having to pay. About how I need to go home and rest. But, she always blamed someone. She blames her mom for having a loud voice, causing her to yell back. She blamed me for offering to help her pay the $440 she stole from her mom when I asked for my money back.

Despite everything, I still loved her. Despite how stressed out I was and how much I wanted to break up with her, I still wanted to be with her. My mom hated her because she saw how tired I looked whenever I came home. She saw that I would rather spend time with her when I had medical school applications to complete, but it was Jessica who begged me to hang out with her. I was incredibly stressed with trying to keep my parents and my girlfriend happy at the time, I began driving recklessly. I would stomp on the gas just to release my anger. And boy, was that dangerous.

What also bothered me was how she questioned why I am always helping someone. Why should I take my brother to the airport when someone else could? Why should I help my dad with yard work when he could do it himself? She may not care about her family, but I love mine and I will do whatever they need me to do.

\-----

THE DOWNFALL

We had fights here and there about how demanding she was, but everything went downhill after our anniversary. A few days after our second anniversary (we hugged and promised to be with each other forever), I came down with a stomach flu. I felt like death with a fever warranting an emergency room. But, Jessica wanted to hang out. Reluctantly, I went over, and we went to a restaurant. We then went back to her house and I just laid there, unable to move. She then proceeded to tell me to go home. After I got home, she messages me that she will be going to eat with her friends. At 12 am, she tells me she’s home and is going to sleep, which is suspicious as she always slept late. Her mom called me later, asking where she was. Turns out, she was “supposedly” at a concert with her friend. I asked her friend and she confirmed. I was really upset by this. Jessica lied straight to my face. I was already incapacitated, and the feeling of betrayal got to me. She tells me that I would be upset anyways, so she decided to lie to me. I wanted to break up.

This was the turning point. This was the start of how I became “manipulative.” This was when I knew, **I became a scumbag** human who deserved to be single. I regret everything I did, and I knew I needed to control my anger.

To show her how much she hurt me, I took a polaroid of the both of us she got me. It was in a waterfilled frame with glitter. I took it and smashed it, recording the whole process. I cut the photo in half, straight between us and sent the recordings to her. I wanted her to know how upset I was. Her sister saw the whole thing and prevented her from seeing most of the recording, only the smashed picture frame. Jessica begged me to come back, and eventually, I did.

*Before we continue, I want to say I don’t like the idea of clubbing. It was a placed filled with alcohol, people I don’t want to associate with, and worse of all, dirty dancing (grinding). Jessica has grinded random strangers in the past. Sure, it bothered me, and we talked about it. She says she never grinded anyone after dating me. I hate how she would come home late, as she had to go to work early the same morning and I was uncomfortable with her being out so late, drunk, and at a place like that. In fact, whenever she goes clubbing, she would go to two clubs, not one. Despite how much I hate the idea of clubbing, I never stopped her from going out. If she wanted to go to the club with her friends, not once did I stop her. In fact, I encouraged her. Sure, I wouldn’t be happy, but I didn’t want to be “controlling.”*

A month later, after the lying incident, she received a message from a guy, asking her to go out to the club after she got accepted into pharmacy school in UW Seattle. I happened to see the message and Jessica tried to hide it. She deleted the message, stating that she never talked to this person before. I pressured her and she admitted he was a friend from school. I pressured her even more and she admitted that he was a guy she met at the club. I pressured her even more and finally she admitted to messaging this guy for a little bit. I, obviously upset, did not want to be with her anymore. The next day, she tried to win me back by buying me cookies and mochi ice cream, but I wasn’t in the mood to talk. I felt cheated on, I felt lied to. I didn’t want to go through what happened the month before. It really affected my ability to study and I was completely miserable. Later in the day, she went clubbing. Obviously, the other guy was there. Let’s call him Steve. Eventually, we got back together. Why? I’m not sure. She begged me to come back, promising me that the guy was no one to her. I still loved her. I guess that’s why I stuck with her.

Now, I am seeing messages from Steve, asking her to hang out, but she tells me that she ignores them and that he asks everyone out. I tried to ignore this fact. A little while later, Jessica had planned to go to clubbing two weekends consecutively. By this time, I figured she has been going to the club a lot more frequently than I am comfortable with. Since I never ask her for anything, as I am pretty independent, I figured it was a good idea to ask her to go only to one instead of both. She agreed but made me feel guilty. I eventually let her go to both, trying to meet halfway by having agree to come home early as she blamed her friend for coming home late. She tells me that her friend, who was her ride, would always want to stay later, which was why she came home late. So, I thought we could meet halfway. I would stay up late at night to take her home. I was always worried about her drinking, but she promised me that she knew her drinking limit, so she wouldn’t be completely drunk.

Lo and behold, she got completely drunk. She called me at the time she promised she would come home, telling me that she will be staying later and that she was really drunk. I was pissed. Not only did I have to stay up late, I had to stay up even later because she broke her promise. The one time I picked her up from the club, she was incapacitated. When I went to pick her up, I was incredibly disappointed. She reeked of alcohol and was unable to think, let alone walk properly. Luckily the police were around as I would have drove recklessly to release my anger. As we got to her home, she threw up everywhere. I pulled her out of my car, carried her up the stairs, and had to take care of her sorry drunk ass while she was hugging the toilet. She also had work in a few hours, but she was in no state to do anything. For the first time, I pulled an all-nighter, and it was to take care of her drunk, lying ass. I was struggling through medical school, too, so you can tell I was outraged. She somehow managed to force me to go out, at 5 in the morning, to buy her food. As soon as I got back, she was already knocked out. I left the food on her desk and walked out.

During that time, I also saw her phone. A ton of phone calls to and from Steve during the time she was out at the club. Boy, did I felt used and cheated on. IN ADDITION, it turned out that her friend left even earlier than her. If her friend had the willpower to do it, why couldn’t she? Obviously, I would have broken up with her, and I tried to, but she managed to reel me in once again.

That was the time when she started sending SnapChats to Steve. It started with a “cute” picture of herself, which he saved. This continued for about 20 days. But, I didn’t know. She went on a trip to Japan and got back on the day of my birthday. I had to pick her and her brother up from the airport. She got me a tiny replica of my favorite car, but that was it for my birthday. I looked through her phone and saw the FIRE on the SnapChat with Steve. Apparently, they were sending pictures to each other since our fight regarding the drunk all-nighter incident. Why did she do it? Because it’s seemed that I didn’t care about her when she was in Japan, when I was busy studying for my medical school finals. What’s worse was that she was on the trip for a week, but was sending pictures to this guy for almost 3 weeks. Although she was on fire with two other people, I was incredibly pissed about Steve. She lied to me about him, about how he was just a friend from school, but was actually a guy at the club, and now this. We fought for a while before I decided to just deal with it. She was going away soon, within a couple of months to Seattle for UW pharmacy. If we were going to last, I had to make sure she was happy for the next couple of months. She promised me that she would remove Steve from her phone. But, obviously she re-added him because she felt he did nothing wrong. I asked if she ever cheated on me and she hesitated. She looked away.

Obviously, we fought a few times regarding her clubbing again and again during those couple of months. There was one time she tried to hide the fact that she went clubbing when I asked her friends where she was one night. She tried to argue with me by telling me she needed to love herself before she could love anyone, which was her reason for going to the club and hiding it from me. There was an incident that pushed me over my limit. I felt used as she forced me to drive her around and around to get her medical papers and things ready for pharmacy school. I got upset and she just went to the club. I had enough and went and destroyed the anniversary book she made me. To me, I felt that we were over. To move on, get rid of anything that reminds me of her, including the anniversary book.

\----

THE BREAKUP

When she was in Seattle, I tried to wake up at 5:00 in the morning to go the gym for free parking, just so I could talk to her at night. A month into her stay at Seattle, I was at home doing a couple of research projects and teaching a small class. Jessica was stressing me out by making me feel guilty for not being able to buy a ticket to fly to her, despite how little money I had and how little time I could give up. Later, I found out that UW Seattle pharmacy was a party school. Pharmacy is not that hard compared to medical school, and I just lost it. When I talked to her about it, about what happened in the past and what may happen in the future, she told me to accept who she was or leave her. I became frustrated with the possibility of her cheating on me, whether on purpose or accidentally. I didn’t want to control her, prevent her from meeting people or having fun. I didn’t want to risk breaking up with her while I was in the middle of exams. I didn’t want to get hurt again, deal with lies or hidden truths. I was incredibly insecure, and she was untrustworthy. I ended the relationship. Two weeks ago, I broke up with Jessica.

At first, I immediately regretted the decision, but Jessica moved on fast. Like almost within a few hours, she went to some night place with lipstick all over the bathroom wall. Although I regretted the decision, I knew it was the right thing to do. During the following week, I started to miss her. I thought about her everyday and nothing I did got my mind off of her. Working on my car or studying for Step 1, nothing I did worked. But, she already moved on. I did the stupid thing of asking if she slept with anyone yet, but she didn’t deny it. Instead, she asked why I should care and if I honestly thought we were going to get back together after I “hurt” her so much. The thought of her sleeping with someone got to me and I broke down. For the first time, a guy like me who rarely cries, I bawled like crazy. Seeing those pictures of her with another guy, the foods, everything. All I could think about was how she was sleeping with some guy, IMMEDIATELY after our break up.

For the next week, I went against my better judgement, against my friend’s advice, and tried to contact her. I did everything I could and every means possible to talk to her, but she ignored me. She was really difficult to talk to. Her replies are infrequent, and she told me to move on, that I would be happier with someone “humbler” than she was, that she was happier without me. I guess I really did hurt her badly. What upset me the most was how quickly she moved on. Within a few hours of the break up, she was having the time of her life at a place she wouldn’t be at if it wasn’t for me. Did our relationship meant nothing to her?

My mind is clouded. I did a lot for her and rarely ask her for anything. I gave up as much as I could to make her happy, but the fear and frustration got to me. I was the one who ended things, but only she was the one who moved on.

I started to think about all the happy days, how she was really goofy and made me laugh. How she always wanted to talk to me or spend time with me. Maybe it was because I had no one else to talk to, I was an introvert who was incapable of talking to others. Despite all the flaws about her that she repetitively points out, I thought she was the most beautiful person in the world. She seemed to be the only person who actually wants to be with me, who wants me to hang out. I thought she actually loved me after seeing how she begged me to be with her when I felt like breaking up with her in the past. But now, I really don’t know anymore. I don’t really know if she ever loved me or she just loved the things I did for her.

For the past two weeks, I was depressed about our break up. I understand that I was at fault. I understand that it was my insecurity which drove her to lie to me about her nights out. It was my fear of her leaving me or cheating on me which led me to break up with her. I just don’t feel like I am worth anything anymore. It’s my fault that the relationship ended. It’s my fault for gaining weight during the relationship, it’s my fault for spending the money I have saved up, it’s my fault that I am alone and have no one with hang out with. It’s my fault for being distracted and falling behind school. I just want to say one last thing. I know I am going to get a lot of shit for saying this, but I am small “down there”. It is my biggest insecurity and something that makes me feel insignificant compared to almost every guy in the world.

I dropped all the gifts she gave me at her house and her mom answered the door. When I told her about the break up, she cried. Seems like she wanted me to continue dating her daughter as it seemed only I knew what was going on with her while she was in Seattle. Apparently, her mom tried calling her many times, but she never answered. Instead, she just takes a ton of money to pay for her room and school, etc. I also talked to her ex, who told me that they broke up due to how demanding she was and how she was interfering with his life's goals.

Her sister and her friends probably think I am shit, while my friends think she was horrible. One went through the same thing and knew what I was going through. Another saw that she was using me, another knew I played a role in the downfall of our relationship. Everyone knew I was at fault, that my reactions to what she did to me were wrong, and I accept that. I have every right to be blamed for the downfall of our relationship. I am having a hard time focusing on school, a hard time talking to others and making friends. But everyone has their own little group and I, who used to spend all my free time with Jessica, am now alone.

Seeing her having a great time, seeing her so happy, made me even more miserable. I lost my appetite and lost around 6 pounds these last 5 days. We started school again this past Monday. I cannot focus on school and have many responsibilities to get through. I don’t understand why I can’t move on. I was the one who broke up with her. Everyone hates her, especially my family who never want to see her face again. Why do I miss her so much? Why do I still want to be with her? Why do I try to contact her to apologize for trying to break up with her? Why am I the one who’s hurt, after everything she put me through?

**TL;DR: I ended a toxic relationship with my ex-girlfriend, who used me and lied to me. Now I am depressed and (despite my better judgement) want to go back to her, but she won’t take me back. I want to move on, but I am having a lot of trouble doing so.**"
9bw11o,18,2018-08-31,My relationship with my mother has always been rocky and she convinced me it was my fault.,LittleDoodka,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/9bw11o/my_relationship_with_my_mother_has_always_been/,"It's been years of endless fights, blaming and drama and I am finally taking a stand at attempting to cut any contact with my mother.
My whole life she taught me that she's my only friend, my only close person and that I cannot trust anyone else, but her. Just last year we had a huge fight because she wanted to live with me and my husband when we graduate from college...fuck no! She has always talked about how she and I are going to live together when I graduate and get a job and leave my dad back home (I'm Asian, and live in Europe) 
From when I was little, she constantly painted my father in the worst ways- from talking to me about his sexual performance to his inability to be a man. She only turned to him for support when I was ""misbehaving"" and she needed someone to back her up. From a young age I learned that his word meant nothing and I am not allowed to ask him if I can go out, get stuff or anything at all. Yes, they are married and she completely emasculates him on a daily basis. I cannot side with my dad because he lives with her and I suppose he's trying to keep her happy for his own sake even if that means turning against me. I honestly don't really know the guy. Our relationship has always been distant because of my mom. 

There has been so much drama between my mom and me. From her lying about having cancer to lying that my dad was beating her and so on. The most recent fight we had changed everything for me...
My husband and I graduated from college in May and I invited my mom to come for the graduation and meet my husband's parents. (I don't have a lot of money and neither do my parents, so I could only afford to have one of them and I invited her because she really wanted to come) I invited her to come for 2 weeks and stay with us, so that we can show her around before our summer internships started. She freaked out on me because it wasn't acceptable for me to invite her for anything less than 3 months. I said no and she didn't talk to me for a month until one day my dad called and said that I needed to have my mom for 3 weeks! It was a compromise, so I agreed and arranged for her to stay with friends and my parents in law while my husband and I were working. Later I heard that she behaved pretty badly and even talked to my friend about her and my dad not living together (which is crap because they totally do) and was disrespect to my in-laws and friends who have been nothing, but INCREDIBLY nice to me and have taken care of me for the years I've known them! The week before her flight back home she even threw a fit that we all lied to her about her flight info and that everyone was trying to get rid of her....

I'm only scratching the surface of hours and hours of fucked up stories and it's a big step for me to come out admit that it all happened. My mom always taught me to never talk negatively about our family to people regardless of the circumstances, but fuck that! I started going to therapy and now in my early 30s I have huge mommy issues! I wanted to post this because since I stopped talking to her a few months ago, she's constantly trying to lure me back. She always throws a tantrum about how delusional and crazy I'm, then she begs me to talk to her because we are family and last she says she's in the hospital. Yesterday I received an email from her saying ""I'm depressed...you know what that means..."" so I'm expecting another email saying ""I'm in the hospital"" soon. 

I did not tell her why I stopped talking to her this time! I just blocked her from everything, but email. It's not just one thing that has led me to shut her out and telling her does nothing because she doesn't have the capability to listen and I'm tired of dealing with her! If that means I'm a bad child, so be it! 
I really want to keep this up and not give in, which is why I'm writing this post! She raised me and she knows how to pull my strings like no one else! I know I cannot change/help her! It's impossible as she doesn't hear anything and it's not worth sacrificing myself and my family for her! 
My husband and having a family of my own gave me the strength to stand up to her and I'm grateful for that, but also hate myself a little because I'm obviously weak and can't stand on my own! 
Thank you so much for reading! I know I scribbled a lot.

9bw1ix,44,2018-08-31,Preparing for the Job Search: A Guide for Psychology Undergrads,intangiblemango,psychologystudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychologystudents/comments/9bw1ix/preparing_for_the_job_search_a_guide_for/,"Your bachelor’s degree in psychology is valuable. Say it. Believe it. Trust it. 

I regularly hear folks working on this degree downplaying their value and their skills. If you cannot explain why your degree is valuable, you’re going to have a rough time convincing other people of this fact. 

The truth is that you can absolutely get a job with a bachelor’s in psychology. Your choices are not fry cook or grad school. 

*Some background:*

It probably doesn’t surprise you to hear that people with bachelor’s degrees in psychology are more likely than people in other fields to go on to graduate education. 33% of psych majors will go on to get a Master’s degree and an additional 10% will go on to get a doctoral or professional degree… but 57% of them max out at a bachelor’s and plenty of folks with a bachelor’s will be employed before attending graduate school (see: http://www.apa.org/monitor/2017/10/datapoint.aspx ). 

Guess what? 57% of your classmates are not, in fact, doomed to be unemployed forever! You can see some of the fields that folks are actually working in here — http://www.apa.org/workforce/data-tools/careers-psychology.aspx (although I would talk them with a grain of salt given that some of these careers are… not… things you can do with a bachelor’s in psych as your highest degree… Career data gets real weird real fast). 

Lots of folks have bachelor’s degrees in psych— about 3.4 million (see: http://www.apa.org/workforce/data-tools/degrees-pathways.aspx ). This can, of course, make job-searching competitive. For the purposes of this post, I am going to assume that you are are interested in a job that is in some way related to your degree and that your primary focus is job searching and not graduate school (regardless of whether you are considering attending graduate school in future). If I was making a guide for an aspiring grad student, some of the key points here might be somewhat different. (Cough cough research cough cough.)

Here are some things that might help with this focus. This is not a complete list and there may be things where you think, “Ugh, no, that’s not going to work for me!” That’s fine! My hope is that students who are stressed about this can come up with some new ideas and resources for job-searching and feel affirmed that this is possible. 

*Things to do well in advance of graduation, if possible:*

Develop some skills and interests. If you’re not very far into your undergraduate education, it’s totally chill if you don’t know exactly what you want to do or what populations you want to work with, but you should ‘try some stuff on’. Use your school’s career center to identify jobs or paid internships that might be related to your interests. If your school has a grant to fund student internships, apply to it. If your program has connections to the community or specific community organizations that take interns, connect with them. Google local non-profits and see what they need. Check out what your professors are doing for research. 

If you can’t find a paid job that’s related to psychology, see what you can do that would build experience. For example, if you work at a daycare, maybe 99% of what you are doing is making playdoh and changing diapers… but can you shadow someone who is completing a developmental screener? Can you sit in on a family advocacy meeting? Can you help develop curriculum that is targeted towards a specific developmental goal? Can you help track developmental outcomes? If you work in sales, can you help manage the database of customers? Can you track efficacy of marketing emails? (Nonprofits love stuff like this!) These are helpful-ass skills and the more you can advocate to learn helpful-ass skills, the more helpful-ass skills you’ll know when you apply to jobs. Write those things down so that in future years, you can remind yourself, “Oh, hey, I actually do have experience doing X!”

You may also want to reflect on the classes you are taking. If you decide you are interested in working in the juvenile justice system, can you fit in a sociology of crime class? Can you take a class on racial equity and justice? 

This is not meant to say that you must be the platonic ideal of unpaid internship after unpaid internship. It IS to say that when you graduate, you should be able to say something other than “I have this piece of paper.” You should be able to say, “I have this piece of paper AND I have XYZ experiences AND I have XYZ skills.”

*Things to do somewhat in advance of graduation, if possible:*

Update your resume. I find it easiest to have an “extended” resume with everything you might ever need to tell anyone, and to delete things when I am tailoring it to specific jobs. Be really thoughtful about ways you have taken initiative, shown leadership, or accomplished things. 

Make a list of the types of jobs you might be interested in. Broadly speaking, human services jobs are often a good fit for people with bachelor’s degrees in psychology, but you might interested in something like working in human resources or working in education. Browse local job listings (or listings in places where you want to live) and get a sense of the job market. Do these jobs ask for skills that you have time to acquire? What types of jobs look realistic?

Explore O*Net and look at salaries, related jobs, and places where your job might pay better or work better for you — https://www.onetonline.org

Meet with a career counselor at your school, if possible, and look over your resume and broaden your list of options. Consider what would make a job a long-term prospect for you and what would make it something more temporary. Check how long you have access to career counseling services after you graduate— many school continue to offer access to the career center for years after graduation. Some schools have career centers that are open to the public. Your school may also offer interview workshops or other job activities that will offer relevant skills. 

If you want to stay in the area, identify local organizations that house the type of jobs you might want. See if there is anyone you can sit down with for an informational interview-- basically learning more about the organization, the specific job, and what people are looking for. (If you meet at, say, a coffee shop, buy that person coffee.)

*Finally:*

Try to be zen about the process. Job-searching totally sucks for pretty much everyone. It is soul-crushing, but you can develop strategies for it to be a little less soul-crushing. You may, for example, want to set a goal to apply for one job a day instead of spending 10 hours straight applying and then never thinking about it again. 

If it takes you some time to find a job that is a good match for you, know that there are peers in all sorts of degrees that are taking time, too. (Also, philosophically, your value as a person is not determined by your productivity or economic contribution… but, you know. Gotta eat to live.)

When you get an offer, be sure to reflect on whether it offers fair compensation and seems like a positive work environment. 

About the author: I am a human with a bachelor’s degree in psychology. I am currently a doctoral student, but I worked in the field for a number of years before going back. My jobs, achieved with a bachelor’s degree in psych as my highest degree, have been valuable and enjoyable. I also give clinical supervision to juniors and seniors for their undergraduate internships and thus have a fairly good sense of what types of jobs students tend to be offered upon graduation. "
