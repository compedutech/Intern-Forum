If anyone has a hookup in Boston, Cleveland/Akron/Canton, San Diego, or anywhere else really, could you let me know. I'm looking to do something either during this coming January or in Jan. 2011 (no classes) or this coming summer. Even if you don't have hookups, suggestions or past experiences are welcome. I was looking around my Neuro of Emotions class yesterday and panicked at the thought that everyone else seemed to have at least a summer research internship under their belt. Help!!!

Edit: Thanks for the suggestions everyone. It was quite a surprise to see this post from a few hours ago on my frontpage."

Okay, so first I'll just basically sum up the context of the situation. Four years ago when I was 13 I went to a summer camp in Maine on the recommendation of my mom's friend, for three out of a maximum seven weeks. I loved it and decided to go back every year (which I have done thus far). I made a lot of friends there and generally the same crowd of people return each year (obviously with many not returning each year and many newcomers each year). The next year I met a guy my age who'd been going for many years but whom I hadn't met the previous year, and we became friends. The next year we were there at the same time again and of course we were still friends. The next year (2008), my age group's first year on staff as JCs (junior counsellors), he didn't return. However, his 13-year-old sister (we can call her ""Christine"") who had also been going to camp for many years recognised me as his friend (and she seemed kinda sorta familiar to me so I must have seen her around in previous years), and we started talking and hanging out a fair amount (not like super super close, but casual friends; we'd sit down and talk once in a while, we'd hug whenever we saw each other, she'd frequently tell me she loves me and I'd playfully reply ""I love me too"", and as per her request I gave her one of my name tags, but I digress). Anyway, Christine and I became friends, and after camp we kept in touch via AIM and Facebook (we talked on AIM a fair amount in August, and from there talked at least once or twice every couple months; aside: she would initiate every conversation). I would also occasionally Gimp pictures of her at her request, putting Brian Peppers into the background of all of them just to freak her out (which worked *thoroughly* well, by the way). In April I gave her my phone number.

Now, fast forward to this past summer. I'm 17. Christine's 14. It's precamp (late June). Christine texts me, but I don't recognise her number so I have my friend call her, curse her out, and threaten to kill her. She and I eventually talk on the phone for real a few days later while I'm doing laundry and I find out who she is. Summary of the next couple weeks: Christine and I text each other a fair amount until she arrives; camp starts on June 28; I get arrested on July 2; I wrestle a girl in chocolate pudding on July 4; Christine arrives on July 19 (for the last four weeks of camp). Christine and I immediately got close again, and hung out all the time from the first day she arrived. We became a lot closer than the last year, to the point where people would always ask us if we were dating (to this we would each randomly choose yes or no; sometimes we both said yes, sometimes we both said no, and sometimes our answers were conflicting). We were pretty much always together whenever we could be and she was always physically clinging to me. Eventually, I started picking up on this unexplainable chemistry Christine and I had, and while I always knew she was hot, I actually started to see her that way; before I knew it I was returning her ""I love you""s. I also thought she smelled good, but that's irrelevant. Anyway, we became a lot closer than we'd even been before. She would also occasionally give me some sort of memento of her love like a napkin she drew and wrote all over or a bracelet. Last few days of camp: during the last dance we snuggled together and listened to her iPod, and planned on going in and slow dancing for the last ""With or Without You"", but she was afraid of the owner breaking us up so we didn't; her mom and her brother (whom I hung out with for a while) came to visit the last day of camp; during the last night before she had to go to her cabin we held each other very tightly as she cried hysterically and screamed ""**Don't leave me!**""; when she was about to leave the next day we hugged tightly for a long time, then she clung to me like normal as I walked her over to her mom, who asked on the way to the car if we were allowed to be that close with each other (we weren't :P), to which Christine replied ""**He's my husband!**"", eliciting a dismissing laugh. After Christine was gone I felt a sharp pang of loneliness that persisted until the end of postcamp, though talking to her on the phone and AIM helped cheer me up a lot.

Also, before she left Christine gave me the most adorable card.

&gt;""I think Rick is hot too!"" *(inside joke)*

though I got kicked out  
half the time.)  
I love you!  
Love,  
Christine

Second day back from postcamp, and I'm starting a new internship (huge step down from being a junior director, considering there was basically no work for me to do). My and Christine's mutual friend Emma and I are talking on AIM (she's 17, but was still a camper). That's when a ton of shit starts coming out. tl;dw of the next few months: it turns out Christine's life is *really* fucked up; she and I talk at least once per day on AIM, texting, and phone; we both miss each other *a lot*; I buy her a dozen roses; we plan on me visiting her for Labour Day weekend with a small fraction of my camp salary but my mom decides to be a bitch and stop me; we plan on me visiting her for spring break; we discuss sex on several occasions in a semi-jocular manner; we cam a few times; starting in mid-September there's some sort of drama every once in a while where she'll get really pissed over something small or literally nothing and push me away then get over it eventually.

Anyway, the big tl;dw of the post and the point I've been leading up to; I sent the following email to Christine's parents on the night of Halloween:

&gt;**Subject: This is Christine's friend from camp. I know she'll hate me for sending you this, but I'm really worried about her.**

&gt;Dear Mr. and Mrs. XXX,

&gt;Below are Christine's most recent posts on one of her blogs. Out of concern for her well-being, I've been paying close attention to her blogs ever since I found out about them from our mutual friend Emma; the things she writes are generally very candid and depressing. Taking these most recent posts into account, I'm really worried that she might try to kill or otherwise hurt herself, so despite the invasion of her privacy here I feel obligated to bring the severity of this problem to your attention, if it hasn't been already. From my understanding, you never found out about this (though I may be mistaken), but Christine did attempt to kill herself a while back (I'm not sure exactly when), so the things she's writing here are very serious and likely reflect her true intent.

&gt;As long as I'm telling you all this, I may as well let you know everything I've thought you should know about for a while now. First of all, according to Emma (the aforementioned mutual friend), about a year or so ago, a guy who currently goes to Christine's school tried to rape her (thankfully she was able to get away), and then blackmailed her not to tell anyone about it; I'd personally like nothing more than for him to be forced to apologise to her for what he put her through and thrown in prison. Second, since Christine got home from camp she's been smoking cigarettes as a way to try and ""escape"" her problems; some of our friends told me about how easy it is to get addicted when you're depressed, but she just refused to talk to me for two weeks when I tried to get her to stop. And, as you'll see an allusion to below, she apparently used to be anorexic.

&gt;I really think she needs to see a psychiatrist. I don't know how you or Christine would feel about her having to take pills for the rest of her life, but I know how a lot of antidepressants work, and, depending on the exact neurological causes of her depression, medication is probably the best thing for her (at worst, it's better than her attempted self-medication of cigarettes). I know she has gone to see a therapist, but, while I am not a doctor, it's clear to me that her symptoms are indicative of much more than just typical teenage moodiness, and need to be treated by a trained psychiatric professional as such; this isn't something that will just go away on its own, and it definitely should not be ignored.

&gt;I understand how hard all of this is to deal with, but Christine needs your love and support right now, as well as rational and decisive action on your part. I can't say whether or not directly confronting her about any of this would help her, but whatever you do, please at least keep all of this in mind. It might be best at least initially to not let on that you ever received this email or read her blogs, as she probably wouldn't take it well. I've read about parents of girls in similar situations just throwing them in mental institutions, and all it did was make them more miserable, so I'd also like to warn against such drastic ideas in advance. Maybe you could just think everything over for a few days while keeping a closer eye on her than usual; I honestly don't know exactly how this situation should be approached, as far as getting her to go see a psychiatrist goes (though I do believe that she would go willingly).

&gt;I've also discussed all this with my school guidance counsellor XXX, as he is a professional and has a lot of experience in handling these types of situations. He's going to contact the XXX High School guidance office about Christine on Monday. His email address is XXX.

&gt;Please reply to let me know you received my email and that I have the correct email addresses (I got them off one of the camp Gmail accounts). Thanks.

- is there 3D software out there already like ZBrush which you use all the time and are worth learning (like Adobe Photoshop for 2D)
- what was your entry point? What did you do to set yourself apart?
- are there specific smaller jobs within your company that people can start with on low salaries in order to show their competencies?
- if you were 14 again, what steps would you take now in order to maximize your chances by the time you're 18 to get an internship with one of these companies?
